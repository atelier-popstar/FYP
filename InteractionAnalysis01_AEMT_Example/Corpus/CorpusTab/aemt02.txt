f	ok
g	ok
g	you're starting
g	uhm and there is a stony desert
g	you're actually starting like right
g	uhm
g	kind of across from stony desert
g	and
g	you're kind of going  
g	you're kind of going a little bit to the left and then you kind of slope down
g	and you're going
g	I would say
g	maybe
g	couple miles or something
g	from
g	uhm
g	where you're going down to a plane crash
g	uhm
g	there's a there's  
f	ok wait hold on
g	ok
f	you have to back up a little bit
g	ok
g	so you're starting and there's a stony desert right across from where you start
f	ok
g	and you go to the left a little bit
g	and then
g	uhm
g	you just kind of slope down
g	a little bit too
g	and you're sloping down and then you stop and you go straight
g	after you slope down I'd say
g	like
g	maybe like
g	couple inches you're sloping down
g	and then you go straight
g	for like
g	like
g	five
g	maybe four inches on the paper
g	and there's a plane crash
f	uhm my
f	uh I don't know know what to say
f	my plane crash I don't think is yeah  
f	it's not like in the same place that you're describing 
g	your plane crash 
f	mm  mm
g	uhm
g	alright are you starting  near the  
f	I'm starting  yeah the stony desert
g	are you  
g	you're starting at the stony desert
f	yeah
g	ok and you have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
f	and
g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where you start
g	not right at the stony desert
f	yeah 
g	ok and then you're going
f	ok
g	to the left
g	like an inch
g	and then you're going down
g	like maybe an inch
g	that's your little slope
f	ok
g	and then you go
g	like four or five inches to the left
g	and that's where the plane crash is
g	are you anywhere near there 
f	my plane crash is on the other side but I'll just  ok 
f	so four or five inches and then there's a plane crash 
g	four or five inches to the left
f	ok
g	and then
g	after plane crash
f	am I supposed to start at the same place 
f	ok
g	ok your plane crash isn't there
g	uhm
g	alright well we'll keep going and see
g	alright 
g	so
g	uhm
g	you're at the plane crash
g	and
g	you wanna kind of curve
g	a little
g	to the left
g	and then you  you go up
g	and you're going up like
g	three inches
f	mm hmm
g	and 
g	in those three inches you're kind of curving to te right but it's a slight curve
g	it's not a big curve
f	ok
g	ok
g	and then
g	uhm
g	after that you go straight again
g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
g	and you come  to a collapsed shelter 
g	are you anywere near there 
f	yeah I see that
g	ok
f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
g	yes
f	and there's a collapsed shelter
g	yes
f	ok
g	ok
g	now you're at the collapsed shelter
g	and you go down you slope to the right
g	just a slight slope
g	about like
g	an inch maybe a little bit less
f	to the right 
g	to the right
g	you're sloping
f	ok
f	and then what 
g	ok
g	and then
g	you
g	have a s 
g	you go like straight for about three inches but it's like a s  
g	it's like a slight little upwards to the right
f	mm hmm
g	slight
g	uhm
g	and then you'll come to a savannah
f	ok
g	ok
f	so I pass a waterhole or no 
g	uhhh no
g	no you don't have a waterhole
g	you have a waterhole on your map 
f	yeah
g	well
g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are you near a savannah at all 
f	yeah 
g	ok
f	 I'm at the savannah
g	ok you're at the savannah
g	now you're curving to the rigt and then you go like a straight up about
g	like
g	three inches
f	ok
g	and you're going straight up
g	and then you're curving to the left around slate mountain  do you have a slate mountain 
f	nope I have a white mountain
g	ok well
g	probably the same thing
f	but that's like five six inches from where I am now
f	to the left
g	where are you right now   start at the savannah
f	yeah and I went straight up
g	straight up
f	and then I have a white mountain like six inches to the left
g	hmm
g	well
g	I don't know
g	alright 
g	well just
f	am I supposed to hit every spot on the map 
g	oh you know what the white   oh the white mountain    no you're way up there you shouldn't be over there
g	the slate mountain is towards the right
g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
g	are you in like   
g	are you in like almost the top of the
f	I'm three inches above the savannah
g	no you have  
g	maybe you have different things
g	well alright
f	I know we have different things so
g	alright alright well just
g	just do it like this ok
g	go up like three  three and a half inches
f	and curve down to the left 
g	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
g	it's right next to it
g	it's like right there like where your little path is it's right to the left of it
f	how many inches do you think 
g	maybe like
g	a quarter of an inch
g	to the left of your little path    where your path should be
f	oh
f	ok
g	ok
g	and then so you're curving to the left and you go straight
g	for like
g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
f	yeah
g	and then you slope down to the left
g	and your slope is about two inches it's like a two inch slope 
f	mm hmm
g	ok
g	and then
g	as you're sloping down you'll come to hot wells do you have hot wells 
f	no we'll go with hot springs I have that
g	ok
g	so you're at the hot springs
g	and you're sloping to the left
g	and then your slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as you're going by the hot wells
f	mm hmm
g	ok
g	and then
g	uhm
g	you slope down again
f	elephants 
g	uhm
g	no there's no elephants
g	on my sheet anyway
f	ok
f	do I hit anything when I go down 
g	no
g	you're just going down
g	like you're sloping
g	and your slope is about an inch long
g	and is to the left
f	ok
g	ok
g	and then
g	uhm
g	you finish out your slope and you go about an inch straight
g	to the left
f	ok
g	ok
g	and then after your inch you gradually  well actually no it's not really gradual    it's kinda like a steep slope up
f	to 
g	to the white mountain
f	ok
g	ok 
g	so it's a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it's a steep slope
g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
g	but it's like a slight slope to the right as you're going up but it's steep
f	ok
g	ok
g	so that's about I would say
g	that's about five or six inches
f	mm hmm
g	ok and then as you're passing the white mountain
f	mm hmm
g	uhm you straighten out your slope 
g	and you just go straight up
g	for about two inches
g	ok
f	yep
g	then
f	I hit some round rocks
g	no I don't have any rocks
f	ok
g	ok
f	I hit some rocks though
g	ok
g	uhm
g	and then you're up straight and you've gone the two inches
g	and then you slope
g	well you don't really slope you just kind of like turn to the right  like it's a  just a turn
f	I go to a lake 
g	yes you're going towards the lake
f	ok
g	but
g	you're going about
g	three inches straight across
g	to the lake 
g	and then you are
g	you got that 
f	do I go through anything 
g	uhm
g	no
g	you're not through anything yet you're going actually around the lake
g	so you go three inches straight
g	and then you slope up
g	and you go around the lake and the lake's kinda like in a s  
f	around the lake to the top 
g	the  
g	what 
f	around the top of the lake 
g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake's like in a circle and you kinda make like a circle
f	ok
g	ok
g	and then
g	uhm
g	right next to your circle should be roman baths
g	do you have roman baths 
f	nope
g	ok well
g	they're there
g	so anyway
g	you make
f	I've a plane crash though
g	what 
f	I've that plane crash that we were talking about earlier that's up there
g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
g	so you make that circle
f	ok
f	yeah
g	and 
g	after the circle
g	uhm
g	you move to the left
g	so you bring the circle in like a couple inches
f	ok
g	and you do the curve again and you just go straight down
g	like three inches 
g	and there  do you have any like antelope or anything 
f	yeah
g	ok
g	you go straight down
g	uh like
g	a little past the antelope not much   just so you go around it
f	so wait
f	do I go by the plane crash 
g	uhm
f	do I go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
g	no the  you go to the left of the antelope
f	to the left of the antelope
g	is the plane crash  
g	like
g	to your right 
f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
f	up tp the right
g	yes yeah you just don't even go near there
f	ok
g	you're going like
f	so I go to the left of the antelope
g	you go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
g	and you should have a straight line there
f	ok
f	ok
g	ok
g	and then right around the antelope you take a right
f	do I go around it 
g	around the bottom of it
f	ok
g	ok
f	and to the right 
g	and then to the right and then you go like two inches and that's the finish
f	ok
g	ok
