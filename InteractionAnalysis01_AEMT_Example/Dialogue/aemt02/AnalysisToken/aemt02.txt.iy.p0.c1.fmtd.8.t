start
start g
0	0:0:31	0:0:37	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
1	0:2:40	0:2:45	maybe IY have different things
2	0:2:52	0:2:59	there s a there s  
3	0:5:14	0:5:18	and IY slope is about an inch long
4	0:5:16	0:5:21	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
5	0:5:35	0:5:38	to the left
6	0:5:36	0:5:42	and IY just go straight up
8	0:9:14	0:9:20	IY don t know
9	0:13:32	0:13:38	IY re starting
10	0:13:57	0:13:58	alright are IY starting  near the  
11	0:14:1	0:14:4	IY re just going down
12	0:16:39	0:16:42	four or five inches to the left
13	0:17:8	0:17:9	and then
15	0:18:6	0:18:15	uhm
18	0:21:21	0:21:22	ok
19	0:21:22	0:21:25	and IY re sloping to the left
20	0:21:25	0:21:27	and then IY go
21	0:23:52	0:23:59	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
22	0:23:57	0:24:3	and IY go to the left a little bit
23	0:24:11	0:24:14	and IY go down IY slope to the right
24	0:24:38	0:24:40	ok
26	0:26:51	0:26:55	uhm
27	0:28:47	0:28:56	so that s about IY would say
28	0:29:33	0:29:40	kind of across from stony desert
29	0:31:56	0:31:57	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
30	0:32:8	0:32:15	for about two inches
31	0:33:43	0:33:52	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
32	0:34:24	0:34:25	probably the same thing
33	0:35:25	0:35:31	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
35	0:36:33	0:36:34	uhm
36	0:39:13	0:39:21	so IY re at the hot springs
37	0:39:20	0:39:25	ok IY re at the savannah
38	0:43:20	0:43:23	IY slope down again
39	0:44:55	0:45:1	to IY right 
40	0:46:26	0:46:31	couple miles or something
42	0:49:10	0:49:11	yes IY re going towards the lake
43	0:50:6	0:50:6	IY re going like
44	0:50:8	0:50:8	to the left
45	0:51:10	0:51:19	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
46	0:51:41	0:51:44	uhm
47	0:54:20	0:54:20	maybe
49	0:57:54	0:57:58	ok
53	1:2:44	1:2:52	and then IY are
56	1:4:48	1:4:49	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
58	1:7:19	1:7:19	then
59	1:8:51	1:8:59	like IY re sloping
60	1:10:17	1:10:20	and then
61	1:10:34	1:10:41	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
63	1:11:58	1:12:3	what 
65	1:12:32	1:12:34	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
67	1:12:38	1:12:42	a little
68	1:14:3	1:14:8	uhhh no
69	1:16:26	1:16:33	from
70	1:17:23	1:17:31	and then IY slope
71	1:17:52	1:17:59	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
72	1:18:26	1:18:30	uhm
76	1:20:31	1:20:40	that s about five or six inches
77	1:21:18	1:21:25	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
78	1:22:0	1:22:3	ok
79	1:23:46	1:23:51	IY re actually starting like right
80	1:28:46	1:28:48	like four or five inches to the left
81	1:28:49	1:28:49	ok well
82	1:29:33	1:29:35	uhm
83	1:30:20	1:30:21	uhm
84	1:30:48	1:30:53	ok
85	1:30:58	1:31:1	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
86	1:31:19	1:31:21	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
87	1:31:24	1:31:29	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
88	1:31:36	1:31:36	no IY don t have a waterhole
90	1:31:57	1:32:4	just a slight slope
91	1:35:28	1:35:34	uhm
92	1:35:43	1:35:43	uhm
93	1:35:40	1:35:45	IY go straight down
94	1:37:10	1:37:15	an inch maybe a little bit less
95	1:37:46	1:37:51	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
96	1:40:2	1:40:8	IY wanna kind of curve
97	1:40:59	1:41:3	ok
98	1:41:17	1:41:20	around the bottom of it
99	1:41:25	1:41:33	are IY in like   
101	1:43:37	1:43:38	and there s a plane crash
102	1:44:30	1:44:35	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
103	1:45:34	1:45:34	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
104	1:47:17	1:47:26	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
105	1:47:51	1:47:55	no
106	1:50:35	1:50:44	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
108	1:52:46	1:52:53	after IY slope down IY d say
109	1:53:21	1:53:27	uhm
112	1:55:15	1:55:21	a little bit too
114	1:56:45	1:56:46	so IY go three inches straight
115	1:56:52	1:57:1	for like
118	1:59:21	1:59:28	ok
119	1:59:44	1:59:47	and then
121	2:7:24	2:7:24	ok
122	2:8:2	2:8:8	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
123	2:8:1	2:8:8	like three inches 
124	2:8:27	2:8:29	alright 
126	2:8:59	2:9:6	after plane crash
127	2:10:4	2:10:10	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
129	2:10:46	2:10:52	after that IY go straight again
130	2:11:31	2:11:33	not right at the stony desert
131	2:13:33	2:13:33	to the lake 
133	2:14:35	2:14:41	uhm
134	2:16:39	2:16:41	and then IY  IY go up
135	2:16:50	2:16:58	three inches straight across
137	2:19:5	2:19:6	straight up
138	2:23:21	2:23:21	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
139	2:25:9	2:25:17	maybe like
140	2:25:45	2:25:46	and 
141	2:27:9	2:27:18	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
142	2:29:29	2:29:35	uh like
144	2:30:14	2:30:23	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
145	2:30:24	2:30:25	like
146	2:32:25	2:32:25	and IY re going straight up
147	2:33:15	2:33:18	ok IY plane crash isn t there
149	2:38:55	2:39:2	uhm
151	2:39:20	2:39:24	ok and then IY re going
152	2:40:3	2:40:9	three inches
153	2:40:55	2:41:0	slight
154	2:41:37	2:41:43	ok
155	2:42:17	2:42:20	alright 
158	2:43:6	2:43:11	and

163	2:46:28	2:46:29	have a s 
164	2:47:11	2:47:11	IY re starting at the stony desert
165	2:49:12	2:49:19	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
166	2:50:16	2:50:17	and then
167	2:50:17	2:50:21	for like

170	2:55:54	2:55:56	ok
171	2:57:23	2:57:32	and that s where the plane crash is
172	2:58:50	2:58:51	just do it like this ok
174	3:3:11	3:3:12	and then
177	3:7:11	3:7:18	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
178	3:7:12	3:7:20	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
179	3:8:58	3:9:7	and then IY ll come to a savannah
180	3:9:54	3:9:56	IY got that 
181	3:10:1	3:10:10	no IY have  
184	3:16:56	3:17:4	ok
186	3:18:49	3:18:53	after the circle
188	3:20:18	3:20:20	and then IY slope up
189	3:20:20	3:20:25	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
190	3:20:58	3:21:7	ok
192	3:26:6	3:26:6	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
193	3:26:40	3:26:43	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
195	3:27:1	3:27:1	to the white mountain
196	3:26:56	3:27:3	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
198	3:28:18	3:28:27	alright alright well just
199	3:30:32	3:30:34	about like

201	3:31:37	3:31:37	are IY anywere near there 
202	3:36:47	3:36:53	couple inches IY re sloping down
203	3:36:52	3:36:56	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
205	3:40:50	3:40:53	ok
206	3:40:51	3:40:55	and
207	3:42:39	3:42:45	ok

212	3:51:25	3:51:33	IY move to the left
214	3:59:59	4:0:7	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
215	4:0:12	4:0:15	three inches
216	4:0:29	4:0:36	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
217	4:1:0	4:1:5	ok 
218	4:1:41	4:1:50	uhm
219	4:8:29	4:8:37	IY plane crash 
221	4:13:6	4:13:13	ok
222	4:14:40	4:14:41	no
223	4:15:2	4:15:4	ok

233	4:24:1	4:24:8	ok
234	4:24:59	4:25:2	and 
235	4:25:6	4:25:13	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
236	4:25:10	4:25:15	IY re at the plane crash
237	4:25:33	4:25:42	and IY should have a straight line there
238	4:28:19	4:28:25	well alright
239	4:28:35	4:28:40	and it slopes a little bit to the right
240	4:29:12	4:29:13	it s like a slight little upwards to the right

245	4:35:0	4:35:3	what 
246	4:35:11	4:35:19	maybe four inches on the paper
247	4:35:17	4:35:25	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
248	4:38:44	4:38:46	is the plane crash  
249	4:39:2	4:39:5	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
251	4:41:7	4:41:11	like an inch
252	4:42:40	4:42:48	yes
253	4:44:58	4:45:6	uhm

256	4:48:54	4:48:54	ok
258	4:50:14	4:50:22	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
260	4:54:7	4:54:7	do IY have roman baths 
261	4:55:29	4:55:36	uhm and there is a stony desert
262	4:55:44	4:55:48	IY make
263	5:1:3	5:1:11	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
264	5:2:44	5:2:44	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
265	5:4:7	5:4:7	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
266	5:6:22	5:6:24	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
267	5:7:44	5:7:44	that s IY little slope
268	5:8:8	5:8:15	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
269	5:8:57	5:9:3	are IY anywhere near there 
272	5:13:0	5:13:7	the slate mountain is towards the right
273	5:14:16	5:14:24	well

303	5:55:8	5:55:16	and then IY go straight
304	5:56:20	5:56:27	where IY re going down to a plane crash
305	5:59:23	5:59:24	and then IY slope down to the left
306	5:59:29	5:59:31	to the right
307	6:1:29	6:1:30	on IY sheet anyway
310	6:3:40	6:3:43	you
312	6:5:45	6:5:47	IY re going about
313	6:6:29	6:6:31	well

start f
7	0:6:39	0:6:46	so wait
14	0:17:26	0:17:27	do IY go by the plane crash 
16	0:19:24	0:19:33	ok
17	0:20:6	0:20:6	to the left of the antelope
25	0:26:0	0:26:6	around the top of the lake

191	3:25:59	3:26:2	and then what 
194	3:26:40	3:26:45	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
197	3:27:43	3:27:52	and there s a collapsed shelter
204	3:38:32	3:38:33	ok
208	3:44:26	3:44:35	 IY m at the savannah
211	3:50:37	3:50:41	ok
213	3:59:1	3:59:5	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
220	4:9:44	4:9:44	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
225	4:16:11	4:16:18	mm hmm
228	4:18:56	4:19:5	how many inches do IY think 
229	4:19:6	4:19:7	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
232	4:22:43	4:22:45	ok
241	4:29:25	4:29:32	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
242	4:31:9	4:31:18	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
244	4:34:23	4:34:25	so IY go to the left of the antelope
250	4:40:24	4:40:27	yeah
254	4:45:34	4:45:34	ok wait hold on
257	4:49:27	4:49:28	ok

270	5:9:8	5:9:8	ok
271	5:9:17	5:9:18	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
275	5:17:24	5:17:28	and to the right 
276	5:19:1	5:19:3	mm  mm
277	5:19:1	5:19:9	mm hmm

288	5:35:36	5:35:36	nope
293	5:45:18	5:45:25	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
296	5:46:53	5:46:54	do IY go through anything 
297	5:47:40	5:47:40	up tp the right
300	5:53:39	5:53:46	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
308	6:1:31	6:1:39	ok
309	6:2:30	6:2:35	ok

316	6:6:45	6:6:48	ok
317	6:7:36	6:7:42	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
321	6:12:22	6:12:29	ok
322	6:13:36	6:13:38	ok
323	6:14:33	6:14:34	ok

342	6:28:27	6:28:32	to 
start g
0	0:0:31	0:0:37	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
1	0:2:40	0:2:45	maybe IY have different things
2	0:2:52	0:2:59	there s a there s  
3	0:5:14	0:5:18	and IY slope is about an inch long
4	0:5:16	0:5:21	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
5	0:5:35	0:5:38	to the left
6	0:5:36	0:5:42	and IY just go straight up
8	0:9:14	0:9:20	IY don t know
9	0:13:32	0:13:38	IY re starting
10	0:13:57	0:13:58	alright are IY starting  near the  
11	0:14:1	0:14:4	IY re just going down
12	0:16:39	0:16:42	four or five inches to the left
13	0:17:8	0:17:9	and then
15	0:18:6	0:18:15	uhm
18	0:21:21	0:21:22	ok
19	0:21:22	0:21:25	and IY re sloping to the left
20	0:21:25	0:21:27	and then IY go
21	0:23:52	0:23:59	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
22	0:23:57	0:24:3	and IY go to the left a little bit
23	0:24:11	0:24:14	and IY go down IY slope to the right
24	0:24:38	0:24:40	ok
26	0:26:51	0:26:55	uhm
27	0:28:47	0:28:56	so that s about IY would say
28	0:29:33	0:29:40	kind of across from stony desert
29	0:31:56	0:31:57	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
30	0:32:8	0:32:15	for about two inches
31	0:33:43	0:33:52	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
32	0:34:24	0:34:25	probably the same thing
33	0:35:25	0:35:31	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
35	0:36:33	0:36:34	uhm
36	0:39:13	0:39:21	so IY re at the hot springs
37	0:39:20	0:39:25	ok IY re at the savannah
38	0:43:20	0:43:23	IY slope down again
39	0:44:55	0:45:1	to IY right 
40	0:46:26	0:46:31	couple miles or something
42	0:49:10	0:49:11	yes IY re going towards the lake
43	0:50:6	0:50:6	IY re going like
44	0:50:8	0:50:8	to the left
45	0:51:10	0:51:19	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
46	0:51:41	0:51:44	uhm
47	0:54:20	0:54:20	maybe
49	0:57:54	0:57:58	ok
53	1:2:44	1:2:52	and then IY are
56	1:4:48	1:4:49	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
58	1:7:19	1:7:19	then
59	1:8:51	1:8:59	like IY re sloping
60	1:10:17	1:10:20	and then
61	1:10:34	1:10:41	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
63	1:11:58	1:12:3	what 
65	1:12:32	1:12:34	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
67	1:12:38	1:12:42	a little
68	1:14:3	1:14:8	uhhh no
69	1:16:26	1:16:33	from
70	1:17:23	1:17:31	and then IY slope
71	1:17:52	1:17:59	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
72	1:18:26	1:18:30	uhm
76	1:20:31	1:20:40	that s about five or six inches
77	1:21:18	1:21:25	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
78	1:22:0	1:22:3	ok
79	1:23:46	1:23:51	IY re actually starting like right
80	1:28:46	1:28:48	like four or five inches to the left
81	1:28:49	1:28:49	ok well
82	1:29:33	1:29:35	uhm
83	1:30:20	1:30:21	uhm
84	1:30:48	1:30:53	ok
85	1:30:58	1:31:1	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
86	1:31:19	1:31:21	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
87	1:31:24	1:31:29	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
88	1:31:36	1:31:36	no IY don t have a waterhole
90	1:31:57	1:32:4	just a slight slope
91	1:35:28	1:35:34	uhm
92	1:35:43	1:35:43	uhm
93	1:35:40	1:35:45	IY go straight down
94	1:37:10	1:37:15	an inch maybe a little bit less
95	1:37:46	1:37:51	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
96	1:40:2	1:40:8	IY wanna kind of curve
97	1:40:59	1:41:3	ok
98	1:41:17	1:41:20	around the bottom of it
99	1:41:25	1:41:33	are IY in like   
101	1:43:37	1:43:38	and there s a plane crash
102	1:44:30	1:44:35	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
103	1:45:34	1:45:34	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
104	1:47:17	1:47:26	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
105	1:47:51	1:47:55	no
106	1:50:35	1:50:44	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
108	1:52:46	1:52:53	after IY slope down IY d say
109	1:53:21	1:53:27	uhm
112	1:55:15	1:55:21	a little bit too
114	1:56:45	1:56:46	so IY go three inches straight
115	1:56:52	1:57:1	for like
118	1:59:21	1:59:28	ok
119	1:59:44	1:59:47	and then
121	2:7:24	2:7:24	ok
122	2:8:2	2:8:8	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
123	2:8:1	2:8:8	like three inches 
124	2:8:27	2:8:29	alright 
126	2:8:59	2:9:6	after plane crash
127	2:10:4	2:10:10	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
129	2:10:46	2:10:52	after that IY go straight again
130	2:11:31	2:11:33	not right at the stony desert
131	2:13:33	2:13:33	to the lake 
133	2:14:35	2:14:41	uhm
134	2:16:39	2:16:41	and then IY  IY go up
135	2:16:50	2:16:58	three inches straight across
137	2:19:5	2:19:6	straight up
138	2:23:21	2:23:21	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
139	2:25:9	2:25:17	maybe like
140	2:25:45	2:25:46	and 
141	2:27:9	2:27:18	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
142	2:29:29	2:29:35	uh like
144	2:30:14	2:30:23	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
145	2:30:24	2:30:25	like
146	2:32:25	2:32:25	and IY re going straight up
147	2:33:15	2:33:18	ok IY plane crash isn t there
149	2:38:55	2:39:2	uhm
151	2:39:20	2:39:24	ok and then IY re going
152	2:40:3	2:40:9	three inches
153	2:40:55	2:41:0	slight
154	2:41:37	2:41:43	ok
155	2:42:17	2:42:20	alright 
158	2:43:6	2:43:11	and

163	2:46:28	2:46:29	have a s 
164	2:47:11	2:47:11	IY re starting at the stony desert
165	2:49:12	2:49:19	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
166	2:50:16	2:50:17	and then
167	2:50:17	2:50:21	for like
168	2:51:23	2:51:28	yes
170	2:55:54	2:55:56	ok
171	2:57:23	2:57:32	and that s where the plane crash is
172	2:58:50	2:58:51	just do it like this ok
174	3:3:11	3:3:12	and then
177	3:7:11	3:7:18	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
178	3:7:12	3:7:20	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
179	3:8:58	3:9:7	and then IY ll come to a savannah
180	3:9:54	3:9:56	IY got that 
181	3:10:1	3:10:10	no IY have  
184	3:16:56	3:17:4	ok
186	3:18:49	3:18:53	after the circle
188	3:20:18	3:20:20	and then IY slope up
189	3:20:20	3:20:25	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
190	3:20:58	3:21:7	ok
192	3:26:6	3:26:6	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
193	3:26:40	3:26:43	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
195	3:27:1	3:27:1	to the white mountain
196	3:26:56	3:27:3	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
198	3:28:18	3:28:27	alright alright well just
199	3:30:32	3:30:34	about like
200	3:30:30	3:30:35	uhm
201	3:31:37	3:31:37	are IY anywere near there 
202	3:36:47	3:36:53	couple inches IY re sloping down
203	3:36:52	3:36:56	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
205	3:40:50	3:40:53	ok
206	3:40:51	3:40:55	and
207	3:42:39	3:42:45	ok

210	3:49:32	3:49:34	so
212	3:51:25	3:51:33	IY move to the left
214	3:59:59	4:0:7	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
215	4:0:12	4:0:15	three inches
216	4:0:29	4:0:36	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
217	4:1:0	4:1:5	ok 
218	4:1:41	4:1:50	uhm
219	4:8:29	4:8:37	IY plane crash 
221	4:13:6	4:13:13	ok
222	4:14:40	4:14:41	no
223	4:15:2	4:15:4	ok
224	4:15:9	4:15:9	IY re sloping
226	4:18:9	4:18:9	well just

230	4:21:36	4:21:36	like
231	4:21:39	4:21:42	and IY re going up like
233	4:24:1	4:24:8	ok
234	4:24:59	4:25:2	and 
235	4:25:6	4:25:13	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
236	4:25:10	4:25:15	IY re at the plane crash
237	4:25:33	4:25:42	and IY should have a straight line there
238	4:28:19	4:28:25	well alright
239	4:28:35	4:28:40	and it slopes a little bit to the right
240	4:29:12	4:29:13	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
243	4:31:42	4:31:42	no there s no elephants
245	4:35:0	4:35:3	what 
246	4:35:11	4:35:19	maybe four inches on the paper
247	4:35:17	4:35:25	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
248	4:38:44	4:38:46	is the plane crash  
249	4:39:2	4:39:5	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
251	4:41:7	4:41:11	like an inch
252	4:42:40	4:42:48	yes
253	4:44:58	4:45:6	uhm
255	4:46:50	4:46:58	so IY make that circle
256	4:48:54	4:48:54	ok
258	4:50:14	4:50:22	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
260	4:54:7	4:54:7	do IY have roman baths 
261	4:55:29	4:55:36	uhm and there is a stony desert
262	4:55:44	4:55:48	IY make
263	5:1:3	5:1:11	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
264	5:2:44	5:2:44	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
265	5:4:7	5:4:7	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
266	5:6:22	5:6:24	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
267	5:7:44	5:7:44	that s IY little slope
268	5:8:8	5:8:15	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
269	5:8:57	5:9:3	are IY anywhere near there 
272	5:13:0	5:13:7	the slate mountain is towards the right
273	5:14:16	5:14:24	well
274	5:16:1	5:16:10	they re there
278	5:21:49	5:21:56	ok
279	5:27:1	5:27:2	ok
280	5:27:3	5:27:11	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
281	5:27:5	5:27:13	ok
282	5:27:16	5:27:21	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
283	5:29:25	5:29:34	and then
285	5:31:23	5:31:29	go up like three  three and a half inches

302	5:54:11	5:54:11	IY would say
303	5:55:8	5:55:16	and then IY go straight
304	5:56:20	5:56:27	where IY re going down to a plane crash
305	5:59:23	5:59:24	and then IY slope down to the left
306	5:59:29	5:59:31	to the right
307	6:1:29	6:1:30	on IY sheet anyway
310	6:3:40	6:3:43	you
312	6:5:45	6:5:47	IY re going about
313	6:6:29	6:6:31	well
