start
start g
2	0:1:26	0:1:32	to the lake 
3	0:2:14	0:2:17	couple inches IY re sloping down
4	0:2:28	0:2:28	ok
6	0:5:45	0:5:45	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
7	0:6:36	0:6:37	IY re just going down
8	0:6:54	0:6:56	uhm
10	0:8:30	0:8:30	couple miles or something
11	0:13:41	0:13:46	have a s 
13	0:15:7	0:15:10	a little
15	0:15:12	0:15:21	no there s no elephants
17	0:16:49	0:16:53	after that IY go straight again
18	0:16:57	0:17:1	like
19	0:16:55	0:17:3	three inches
20	0:17:43	0:17:48	so IY make that circle
21	0:19:32	0:19:34	ok
22	0:19:35	0:19:35	maybe like
23	0:20:43	0:20:49	and there s a plane crash
24	0:21:22	0:21:29	and then
25	0:22:4	0:22:4	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
27	0:22:29	0:22:35	for about two inches
28	0:23:18	0:23:21	is the plane crash  
29	0:23:43	0:23:52	uh like
30	0:24:26	0:24:35	uhm
31	0:24:35	0:24:43	and IY go to the left a little bit
32	0:25:13	0:25:15	like
34	0:26:25	0:26:29	and then IY go straight
35	0:27:13	0:27:18	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
36	0:27:41	0:27:49	hmm
39	0:34:17	0:34:25	ok
40	0:35:9	0:35:14	are IY anywere near there 
41	0:35:33	0:35:37	do IY have roman baths 
42	0:38:24	0:38:27	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
43	0:39:42	0:39:47	uhm
45	0:40:25	0:40:32	and IY should have a straight line there
47	0:43:35	0:43:39	are IY  
48	0:44:39	0:44:44	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
49	0:44:46	0:44:48	around the bottom of it
50	0:45:32	0:45:39	no IY don t have a waterhole
53	0:48:14	0:48:15	uhm
54	0:48:57	0:49:2	well
57	0:50:40	0:50:46	maybe IY have different things
59	0:51:4	0:51:11	alright 
61	0:54:57	0:54:58	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
62	0:55:5	0:55:10	after plane crash
63	0:56:12	0:56:18	uhm
65	0:57:50	0:57:56	the  
66	0:58:12	0:58:17	uhm
69	1:0:25	1:0:34	IY re going about
70	1:1:2	1:1:8	but
71	1:3:28	1:3:35	like maybe an inch
72	1:3:58	1:4:7	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
73	1:4:39	1:4:43	probably the same thing
74	1:5:9	1:5:10	uhm
75	1:5:55	1:5:58	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
79	1:9:12	1:9:20	after IY slope down IY d say
80	1:10:3	1:10:10	well just
81	1:10:15	1:10:22	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
82	1:10:27	1:10:28	uhm
83	1:13:0	1:13:4	and IY re sloping to the left
86	1:14:24	1:14:30	for like
87	1:18:11	1:18:14	ok
89	1:18:50	1:18:54	for like
90	1:19:15	1:19:22	they re there
91	1:21:10	1:21:18	and 
92	1:22:27	1:22:31	and then
93	1:25:5	1:25:9	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
95	1:27:2	1:27:4	what 
96	1:27:10	1:27:18	ok
98	1:29:6	1:29:10	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
99	1:29:42	1:29:43	yes IY re going towards the lake
100	1:30:12	1:30:15	and then
101	1:31:17	1:31:17	no IY don t have any rocks
102	1:32:1	1:32:2	uhm and there is a stony desert
103	1:32:1	1:32:8	after the circle
107	1:40:10	1:40:16	IY got that 
108	1:42:59	1:43:6	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
109	1:43:16	1:43:24	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
110	1:43:26	1:43:35	a quarter of an inch
112	1:46:15	1:46:23	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
113	1:48:28	1:48:30	and then
114	1:48:34	1:48:34	not right at the stony desert
116	1:52:10	1:52:11	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
120	1:59:4	1:59:6	IY move to the left
121	2:0:5	2:0:12	uhm
122	2:0:13	2:0:15	maybe
123	2:0:25	2:0:28	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
125	2:2:50	2:2:58	to the left
126	2:9:10	2:9:15	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
127	2:9:27	2:9:35	like
128	2:9:45	2:9:48	and then IY are
129	2:10:9	2:10:17	IY wanna kind of curve
130	2:10:21	2:10:30	go up like three  three and a half inches
131	2:11:0	2:11:8	alright alright well just
132	2:11:41	2:11:45	and it slopes a little bit to the right
133	2:12:8	2:12:14	no
135	2:13:36	2:13:36	and is to the left
138	2:17:46	2:17:49	and 
140	2:21:1	2:21:6	ok
141	2:21:22	2:21:28	uhm
143	2:24:17	2:24:22	ok
144	2:25:6	2:25:15	ok and then IY re going
146	2:26:51	2:27:0	uhm
148	2:28:39	2:28:45	on IY sheet anyway
149	2:29:18	2:29:25	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
150	2:30:6	2:30:15	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
151	2:30:45	2:30:52	like an inch
152	2:36:21	2:36:28	maybe four inches on the paper
153	2:39:6	2:39:14	ok
154	2:39:35	2:39:42	ok
155	2:40:12	2:40:18	just a slight slope
156	2:40:18	2:40:21	it s not a big curve
157	2:41:34	2:41:42	to the white mountain
159	2:42:45	2:42:51	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
160	2:44:55	2:44:57	uhhh no
161	2:49:8	2:49:15	and then IY  IY go up
162	2:54:25	2:54:34	are IY anywhere near there 
163	2:55:12	2:55:19	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
164	2:58:35	2:58:44	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
165	3:2:40	3:2:45	five
166	3:3:44	3:3:46	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
167	3:3:43	3:3:50	a little bit too
168	3:5:16	3:5:16	and then
171	3:8:28	3:8:30	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
173	3:11:36	3:11:41	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
174	3:11:53	3:11:57	and
176	3:18:33	3:18:33	IY re starting at the stony desert
178	3:19:22	3:19:28	ok
179	3:19:27	3:19:30	kind of across from stony desert
180	3:20:6	3:20:12	four or five inches to the left
182	3:21:45	3:21:46	IY make
183	3:22:36	3:22:45	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
184	3:22:39	3:22:46	IY just kind of slope down
185	3:23:54	3:24:1	that s about five or six inches
186	3:26:18	3:26:21	ok
187	3:26:19	3:26:27	IY re sloping
188	3:27:24	3:27:32	it s right next to it
189	3:29:24	3:29:24	slight
190	3:33:33	3:33:38	you
191	3:34:26	3:34:29	ok
192	3:37:44	3:37:50	uhm
193	3:38:19	3:38:20	and IY re going
194	3:38:39	3:38:46	no IY have  
195	3:38:46	3:38:52	so IY go three inches straight
196	3:40:14	3:40:21	ok IY plane crash isn t there
197	3:41:6	3:41:12	what 
198	3:42:33	3:42:36	maybe like
199	3:43:26	3:43:30	and then IY re going down
201	3:46:5	3:46:12	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
202	3:47:46	3:47:52	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
203	3:49:36	3:49:44	ok
204	3:51:4	3:51:12	so anyway
207	3:52:13	3:52:15	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
208	3:53:16	3:53:21	ok
209	3:54:42	3:54:44	ok
210	3:54:58	3:55:5	IY slope down again
211	3:55:20	3:55:23	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
212	3:59:18	3:59:19	and IY re going straight up
213	4:0:2	4:0:7	ok
214	4:4:49	4:4:52	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
216	4:7:9	4:7:17	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
220	4:12:39	4:12:46	uhm
221	4:13:4	4:13:7	to the left
222	4:13:41	4:13:43	ok
224	4:13:54	4:14:1	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
226	4:15:13	4:15:18	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
230	4:18:37	4:18:42	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
231	4:20:21	4:20:21	like
232	4:20:33	4:20:41	ok
233	4:21:54	4:21:59	ok

238	4:26:17	4:26:18	uhm
239	4:29:45	4:29:47	three inches
240	4:30:29	4:30:33	IY would say
242	4:31:25	4:31:25	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
244	4:34:27	4:34:31	and then
245	4:35:57	4:36:1	to the left
246	4:36:39	4:36:45	uhm
247	4:36:43	4:36:46	ok
250	4:40:32	4:40:35	just do it like this ok
251	4:43:57	4:44:3	so IY re at the hot springs
252	4:44:41	4:44:45	and IY re going up like
253	4:45:44	4:45:48	IY re actually starting like right
254	4:45:44	4:45:53	ok IY re at the savannah
256	4:46:33	4:46:40	are IY in like   
257	4:46:46	4:46:54	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
258	4:47:47	4:47:54	to IY right 
259	4:50:8	4:50:17	ok
260	4:53:34	4:53:43	uhm
261	4:56:2	4:56:9	yes
262	4:56:50	4:56:51	straight up
263	4:58:5	4:58:11	like three inches 
264	4:58:43	4:58:47	so that s about IY would say
265	5:1:5	5:1:7	IY plane crash 
267	5:2:6	5:2:15	and then IY slope
268	5:3:48	5:3:54	are IY in like almost the top of the
269	5:7:7	5:7:14	ok
270	5:8:31	5:8:39	and then IY go
272	5:9:41	5:9:49	and then IY ll come to a savannah
273	5:10:24	5:10:31	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
274	5:11:8	5:11:10	IY re kind of going  
276	5:11:53	5:11:59	three inches straight across
277	5:12:24	5:12:26	and then IY slope up
280	5:16:0	5:16:0	and IY just go straight up
281	5:17:52	5:17:59	the slate mountain is towards the right
282	5:18:11	5:18:13	IY go straight down
285	5:19:35	5:19:36	IY re going like
286	5:20:30	5:20:31	IY re starting
287	5:21:56	5:21:58	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
288	5:21:55	5:22:0	well alright
289	5:23:8	5:23:11	no
290	5:23:55	5:23:58	there s a there s  
291	5:24:28	5:24:29	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
292	5:26:20	5:26:26	and then IY slope down to the left
293	5:26:28	5:26:29	and IY slope is about an inch long
295	5:28:34	5:28:35	ok 
299	5:36:40	5:36:44	so
300	5:38:58	5:39:7	and
301	5:40:54	5:41:3	like four or five inches to the left
302	5:41:54	5:41:55	like IY re sloping
304	5:46:53	5:46:59	from
305	5:48:6	5:48:12	alright are IY starting  near the  
307	5:53:26	5:53:34	an inch maybe a little bit less
309	5:55:8	5:55:14	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
310	5:55:59	5:56:1	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
311	5:55:58	5:56:5	ok
313	5:57:20	5:57:26	and IY go down IY slope to the right
314	5:57:38	5:57:38	to the right
316	5:59:37	5:59:42	and then
317	5:59:38	5:59:45	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
318	6:0:51	6:0:59	IY don t know
319	6:0:57	6:1:4	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
320	6:3:34	6:3:40	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
322	6:4:47	6:4:53	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
323	6:6:11	6:6:17	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
324	6:6:44	6:6:51	alright well IY ll keep going and see
325	6:9:19	6:9:28	then
326	6:10:51	6:10:58	ok
327	6:11:6	6:11:8	yes
330	6:16:27	6:16:35	where IY re going down to a plane crash
332	6:17:25	6:17:25	alright 
333	6:19:8	6:19:17	about like
334	6:19:40	6:19:46	that s IY little slope
335	6:20:2	6:20:10	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
336	6:20:16	6:20:19	uhm
337	6:21:35	6:21:38	ok well
338	6:21:44	6:21:51	and then
339	6:24:39	6:24:41	and that s where the plane crash is
340	6:25:2	6:25:7	IY re at the plane crash
342	6:27:18	6:27:22	ok well
start f
0	0:0:21	0:0:26	mm hmm
1	0:0:19	0:0:28	yeah

16	0:15:59	0:16:8	ok
26	0:22:34	0:22:35	do IY go by the plane crash 
33	0:25:47	0:25:49	uh IY don t know know what to say
37	0:29:9	0:29:10	elephants 
38	0:33:38	0:33:41	yeah

51	0:46:7	0:46:11	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
52	0:46:12	0:46:21	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
55	0:49:46	0:49:52	ok
56	0:50:9	0:50:13	ok
58	0:50:50	0:50:59	ok

117	1:53:27	1:53:29	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
118	1:54:32	1:54:39	nope IY have a white mountain
119	1:55:11	1:55:14	ok

142	2:23:48	2:23:51	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
145	2:26:22	2:26:23	mm  mm
147	2:27:40	2:27:45	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
158	2:42:2	2:42:4	to the left
169	3:6:8	3:6:12	and to the right 
170	3:7:40	3:7:45	around the lake to the top 
172	3:8:55	3:8:55	ok
175	3:16:20	3:16:27	mm hmm
177	3:18:30	3:18:37	yep
181	3:20:59	3:21:0	ok wait hold on
200	3:44:51	3:44:52	IY know IY have different things so
205	3:51:32	3:51:39	how many inches do IY think 
206	3:51:57	3:52:2	IY m three inches above the savannah
215	4:5:38	4:5:38	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
217	4:10:54	4:11:2	yeah and IY went straight up
218	4:11:9	4:11:9	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
219	4:12:3	4:12:5	IY hit some rocks though
223	4:13:49	4:13:54	so IY go to the left of the antelope
225	4:14:47	4:14:54	ok
227	4:15:25	4:15:32	ok
228	4:17:56	4:17:59	ok
229	4:18:26	4:18:29	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
234	4:24:43	4:24:52	ok
235	4:24:46	4:24:52	ok
236	4:25:23	4:25:29	IY ve a plane crash though
241	4:30:59	4:31:2	ok
243	4:34:6	4:34:6	IY hit some round rocks
248	4:38:0	4:38:1	ok
249	4:40:7	4:40:12	to 
255	4:46:13	4:46:15	to the left of the antelope
266	5:1:8	5:1:12	ok
271	5:9:33	5:9:39	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
275	5:11:47	5:11:47	mm hmm
278	5:13:45	5:13:54	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
279	5:14:2	5:14:8	around the top of the lake 
283	5:18:28	5:18:32	ok
284	5:19:20	5:19:29	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
294	5:27:59	5:28:6	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
296	5:28:57	5:28:57	ok
297	5:29:19	5:29:21	ok
298	5:31:6	5:31:12	so wait
303	5:42:38	5:42:42	and curve down to the left 
306	5:53:23	5:53:30	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
308	5:54:38	5:54:47	IY have to back up a little bit
312	5:57:16	5:57:20	oh
315	5:58:56	5:59:1	and there s a collapsed shelter
321	6:4:42	6:4:42	ok
328	6:11:14	6:11:21	ok
329	6:13:28	6:13:28	ok
331	6:17:4	6:17:7	up tp the right
341	6:27:13	6:27:14	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
start g
2	0:1:26	0:1:32	to the lake 
3	0:2:14	0:2:17	couple inches IY re sloping down
4	0:2:28	0:2:28	ok
6	0:5:45	0:5:45	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
7	0:6:36	0:6:37	IY re just going down
8	0:6:54	0:6:56	uhm
10	0:8:30	0:8:30	couple miles or something
11	0:13:41	0:13:46	have a s 
13	0:15:7	0:15:10	a little
15	0:15:12	0:15:21	no there s no elephants
17	0:16:49	0:16:53	after that IY go straight again
18	0:16:57	0:17:1	like
19	0:16:55	0:17:3	three inches
20	0:17:43	0:17:48	so IY make that circle
21	0:19:32	0:19:34	ok
22	0:19:35	0:19:35	maybe like
23	0:20:43	0:20:49	and there s a plane crash
24	0:21:22	0:21:29	and then
25	0:22:4	0:22:4	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
27	0:22:29	0:22:35	for about two inches
28	0:23:18	0:23:21	is the plane crash  
29	0:23:43	0:23:52	uh like
30	0:24:26	0:24:35	uhm
31	0:24:35	0:24:43	and IY go to the left a little bit
32	0:25:13	0:25:15	like
34	0:26:25	0:26:29	and then IY go straight
35	0:27:13	0:27:18	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
36	0:27:41	0:27:49	hmm
39	0:34:17	0:34:25	ok
40	0:35:9	0:35:14	are IY anywere near there 
41	0:35:33	0:35:37	do IY have roman baths 
42	0:38:24	0:38:27	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
43	0:39:42	0:39:47	uhm
45	0:40:25	0:40:32	and IY should have a straight line there
47	0:43:35	0:43:39	are IY  
48	0:44:39	0:44:44	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
49	0:44:46	0:44:48	around the bottom of it
50	0:45:32	0:45:39	no IY don t have a waterhole
53	0:48:14	0:48:15	uhm
54	0:48:57	0:49:2	well
57	0:50:40	0:50:46	maybe IY have different things
59	0:51:4	0:51:11	alright 
61	0:54:57	0:54:58	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
62	0:55:5	0:55:10	after plane crash
63	0:56:12	0:56:18	uhm
65	0:57:50	0:57:56	the  
66	0:58:12	0:58:17	uhm
69	1:0:25	1:0:34	IY re going about
70	1:1:2	1:1:8	but
71	1:3:28	1:3:35	like maybe an inch
72	1:3:58	1:4:7	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
73	1:4:39	1:4:43	probably the same thing
74	1:5:9	1:5:10	uhm
75	1:5:55	1:5:58	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
79	1:9:12	1:9:20	after IY slope down IY d say
80	1:10:3	1:10:10	well just
81	1:10:15	1:10:22	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
82	1:10:27	1:10:28	uhm
83	1:13:0	1:13:4	and IY re sloping to the left
86	1:14:24	1:14:30	for like
87	1:18:11	1:18:14	ok
89	1:18:50	1:18:54	for like
90	1:19:15	1:19:22	they re there
91	1:21:10	1:21:18	and 
92	1:22:27	1:22:31	and then
93	1:25:5	1:25:9	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
95	1:27:2	1:27:4	what 
96	1:27:10	1:27:18	ok
98	1:29:6	1:29:10	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
99	1:29:42	1:29:43	yes IY re going towards the lake
100	1:30:12	1:30:15	and then
101	1:31:17	1:31:17	no IY don t have any rocks
102	1:32:1	1:32:2	uhm and there is a stony desert
103	1:32:1	1:32:8	after the circle
107	1:40:10	1:40:16	IY got that 
108	1:42:59	1:43:6	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
109	1:43:16	1:43:24	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
110	1:43:26	1:43:35	a quarter of an inch
112	1:46:15	1:46:23	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
113	1:48:28	1:48:30	and then
114	1:48:34	1:48:34	not right at the stony desert
116	1:52:10	1:52:11	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
120	1:59:4	1:59:6	IY move to the left
121	2:0:5	2:0:12	uhm
122	2:0:13	2:0:15	maybe
123	2:0:25	2:0:28	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
125	2:2:50	2:2:58	to the left
126	2:9:10	2:9:15	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
127	2:9:27	2:9:35	like
128	2:9:45	2:9:48	and then IY are
129	2:10:9	2:10:17	IY wanna kind of curve
130	2:10:21	2:10:30	go up like three  three and a half inches
131	2:11:0	2:11:8	alright alright well just
132	2:11:41	2:11:45	and it slopes a little bit to the right
133	2:12:8	2:12:14	no
135	2:13:36	2:13:36	and is to the left
138	2:17:46	2:17:49	and 
140	2:21:1	2:21:6	ok
141	2:21:22	2:21:28	uhm
143	2:24:17	2:24:22	ok
144	2:25:6	2:25:15	ok and then IY re going
146	2:26:51	2:27:0	uhm
148	2:28:39	2:28:45	on IY sheet anyway
149	2:29:18	2:29:25	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
150	2:30:6	2:30:15	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
151	2:30:45	2:30:52	like an inch
152	2:36:21	2:36:28	maybe four inches on the paper
153	2:39:6	2:39:14	ok
154	2:39:35	2:39:42	ok
155	2:40:12	2:40:18	just a slight slope
156	2:40:18	2:40:21	it s not a big curve
157	2:41:34	2:41:42	to the white mountain
159	2:42:45	2:42:51	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
160	2:44:55	2:44:57	uhhh no
161	2:49:8	2:49:15	and then IY  IY go up
162	2:54:25	2:54:34	are IY anywhere near there 
163	2:55:12	2:55:19	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
164	2:58:35	2:58:44	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
165	3:2:40	3:2:45	five
166	3:3:44	3:3:46	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
167	3:3:43	3:3:50	a little bit too
168	3:5:16	3:5:16	and then
171	3:8:28	3:8:30	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
173	3:11:36	3:11:41	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
174	3:11:53	3:11:57	and
176	3:18:33	3:18:33	IY re starting at the stony desert
178	3:19:22	3:19:28	ok
179	3:19:27	3:19:30	kind of across from stony desert
180	3:20:6	3:20:12	four or five inches to the left
182	3:21:45	3:21:46	IY make
183	3:22:36	3:22:45	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
184	3:22:39	3:22:46	IY just kind of slope down
185	3:23:54	3:24:1	that s about five or six inches
186	3:26:18	3:26:21	ok
187	3:26:19	3:26:27	IY re sloping
188	3:27:24	3:27:32	it s right next to it
189	3:29:24	3:29:24	slight
190	3:33:33	3:33:38	you
191	3:34:26	3:34:29	ok
192	3:37:44	3:37:50	uhm
193	3:38:19	3:38:20	and IY re going
194	3:38:39	3:38:46	no IY have  
195	3:38:46	3:38:52	so IY go three inches straight
196	3:40:14	3:40:21	ok IY plane crash isn t there
197	3:41:6	3:41:12	what 
198	3:42:33	3:42:36	maybe like
199	3:43:26	3:43:30	and then IY re going down
201	3:46:5	3:46:12	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
202	3:47:46	3:47:52	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
203	3:49:36	3:49:44	ok
204	3:51:4	3:51:12	so anyway
207	3:52:13	3:52:15	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
208	3:53:16	3:53:21	ok
209	3:54:42	3:54:44	ok
210	3:54:58	3:55:5	IY slope down again
211	3:55:20	3:55:23	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
212	3:59:18	3:59:19	and IY re going straight up
213	4:0:2	4:0:7	ok
214	4:4:49	4:4:52	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
216	4:7:9	4:7:17	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
220	4:12:39	4:12:46	uhm
221	4:13:4	4:13:7	to the left
222	4:13:41	4:13:43	ok
224	4:13:54	4:14:1	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
226	4:15:13	4:15:18	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
230	4:18:37	4:18:42	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
231	4:20:21	4:20:21	like
232	4:20:33	4:20:41	ok
233	4:21:54	4:21:59	ok

238	4:26:17	4:26:18	uhm
239	4:29:45	4:29:47	three inches
240	4:30:29	4:30:33	IY would say
242	4:31:25	4:31:25	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
244	4:34:27	4:34:31	and then
245	4:35:57	4:36:1	to the left
246	4:36:39	4:36:45	uhm
247	4:36:43	4:36:46	ok
250	4:40:32	4:40:35	just do it like this ok
251	4:43:57	4:44:3	so IY re at the hot springs
252	4:44:41	4:44:45	and IY re going up like
253	4:45:44	4:45:48	IY re actually starting like right
254	4:45:44	4:45:53	ok IY re at the savannah
256	4:46:33	4:46:40	are IY in like   
257	4:46:46	4:46:54	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
258	4:47:47	4:47:54	to IY right 
259	4:50:8	4:50:17	ok
260	4:53:34	4:53:43	uhm
261	4:56:2	4:56:9	yes
262	4:56:50	4:56:51	straight up
263	4:58:5	4:58:11	like three inches 
264	4:58:43	4:58:47	so that s about IY would say
265	5:1:5	5:1:7	IY plane crash 
267	5:2:6	5:2:15	and then IY slope
268	5:3:48	5:3:54	are IY in like almost the top of the
269	5:7:7	5:7:14	ok
270	5:8:31	5:8:39	and then IY go
272	5:9:41	5:9:49	and then IY ll come to a savannah
273	5:10:24	5:10:31	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
274	5:11:8	5:11:10	IY re kind of going  
276	5:11:53	5:11:59	three inches straight across
277	5:12:24	5:12:26	and then IY slope up
280	5:16:0	5:16:0	and IY just go straight up
281	5:17:52	5:17:59	the slate mountain is towards the right
282	5:18:11	5:18:13	IY go straight down
285	5:19:35	5:19:36	IY re going like
286	5:20:30	5:20:31	IY re starting
287	5:21:56	5:21:58	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
288	5:21:55	5:22:0	well alright
289	5:23:8	5:23:11	no
290	5:23:55	5:23:58	there s a there s  
291	5:24:28	5:24:29	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
292	5:26:20	5:26:26	and then IY slope down to the left
293	5:26:28	5:26:29	and IY slope is about an inch long
295	5:28:34	5:28:35	ok 
299	5:36:40	5:36:44	so
300	5:38:58	5:39:7	and
301	5:40:54	5:41:3	like four or five inches to the left
302	5:41:54	5:41:55	like IY re sloping
304	5:46:53	5:46:59	from
305	5:48:6	5:48:12	alright are IY starting  near the  
307	5:53:26	5:53:34	an inch maybe a little bit less
309	5:55:8	5:55:14	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
310	5:55:59	5:56:1	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
311	5:55:58	5:56:5	ok
313	5:57:20	5:57:26	and IY go down IY slope to the right
314	5:57:38	5:57:38	to the right
316	5:59:37	5:59:42	and then
317	5:59:38	5:59:45	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
318	6:0:51	6:0:59	IY don t know
319	6:0:57	6:1:4	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
320	6:3:34	6:3:40	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
322	6:4:47	6:4:53	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
323	6:6:11	6:6:17	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
324	6:6:44	6:6:51	alright well IY ll keep going and see
325	6:9:19	6:9:28	then
326	6:10:51	6:10:58	ok
