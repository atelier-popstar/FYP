start
0:0:22	0:0:22	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
0:1:47	0:1:55	g	that s about five or six inches
0:3:4	0:3:10	g	so IY re at the hot springs
0:3:10	0:3:17	g	well
0:4:29	0:4:30	g	like three inches 
0:6:40	0:6:47	g	so IY make that circle
0:7:21	0:7:28	g	and then
0:9:10	0:9:13	g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
0:9:32	0:9:41	f	yeah
0:9:45	0:9:45	g	yes
0:11:23	0:11:25	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
0:12:39	0:12:44	g	probably the same thing
0:14:56	0:15:1	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
0:15:18	0:15:21	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
0:18:42	0:18:51	g	uhm
0:18:56	0:18:58	f	mm hmm
0:21:30	0:21:39	g	ok

0:40:29	0:40:30	g	ok
0:42:49	0:42:58	g	IY plane crash 
0:44:27	0:44:32	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
0:44:45	0:44:50	g	uhm
0:45:9	0:45:18	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
0:46:40	0:46:44	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
0:47:53	0:47:57	g	and then IY slope
0:48:44	0:48:44	g	and
0:49:20	0:49:25	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
0:50:20	0:50:28	g	IY wanna kind of curve
0:51:9	0:51:9	g	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
0:51:36	0:51:41	g	IY re starting
0:51:53	0:52:0	g	ok
0:53:3	0:53:9	f	IY m three inches above the savannah

1:4:9	1:4:16	f	nope IY have a white mountain
1:4:40	1:4:46	g	the  
1:5:52	1:5:56	g	after that IY go straight again
1:6:55	1:6:56	g	a little
1:8:30	1:8:34	g	to IY right 
1:8:32	1:8:37	g	no IY have  
1:9:1	1:9:3	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
1:10:2	1:10:5	g	five
1:10:17	1:10:26	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
1:11:3	1:11:10	g	well just
1:11:59	1:12:0	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right
1:12:5	1:12:9	f	elephants 
1:12:15	1:12:20	g	on IY sheet anyway
1:12:38	1:12:38	g	IY don t know

1:22:32	1:22:37	g	ok
1:23:47	1:23:51	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
1:24:49	1:24:51	f	do IY go through anything 
1:25:44	1:25:48	g	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there

1:32:15	1:32:15	g	a little bit too
1:32:14	1:32:22	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
1:33:59	1:34:1	f	and curve down to the left 
1:34:12	1:34:12	g	that s IY little slope
1:34:12	1:34:15	g	couple miles or something
1:34:33	1:34:41	g	like four or five inches to the left
1:35:17	1:35:21	g	like
1:37:5	1:37:10	f	mm hmm
1:38:46	1:38:48	g	IY re going like
1:39:46	1:39:55	g	ok
1:41:20	1:41:22	g	after the circle
1:42:28	1:42:32	g	and then
1:42:55	1:42:58	g	like an inch
1:43:39	1:43:45	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
1:46:48	1:46:53	f	IY hit some round rocks
1:47:23	1:47:31	f	ok
1:48:31	1:48:31	g	uh like
1:48:27	1:48:32	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
1:48:49	1:48:52	f	ok
1:49:8	1:49:16	f	ok
1:49:23	1:49:30	g	is the plane crash  
1:51:5	1:51:13	g	straight up
1:52:1	1:52:4	f	yeah and IY went straight up
1:54:7	1:54:12	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
1:54:52	1:54:53	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
1:56:29	1:56:32	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
1:59:19	1:59:28	g	ok
1:59:51	1:59:55	g	just a slight slope
2:7:19	2:7:22	f	do IY go around it 
2:8:47	2:8:50	f	ok
2:11:2	2:11:11	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
2:11:42	2:11:42	g	and IY re going straight up
2:11:56	2:12:3	g	and then IY go straight
2:12:24	2:12:33	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
2:12:28	2:12:37	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
2:13:16	2:13:18	g	maybe four inches on the paper
2:15:1	2:15:10	g	and then
2:17:56	2:17:59	g	just do it like this ok
2:18:28	2:18:35	g	ok
2:19:4	2:19:10	f	ok
2:20:12	2:20:21	g	and IY re going
2:20:32	2:20:33	f	ok
2:20:42	2:20:45	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
2:21:17	2:21:17	g	IY got that 
2:22:23	2:22:26	f	to the left of the antelope
2:22:31	2:22:35	g	and IY re sloping to the left
2:24:48	2:24:52	g	so that s about IY would say
2:27:7	2:27:15	f	ok
2:30:49	2:30:53	f	ok
2:31:32	2:31:33	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
2:31:45	2:31:46	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
2:31:44	2:31:49	f	uhm my
2:33:17	2:33:19	f	yeah
2:34:40	2:34:41	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
2:36:10	2:36:18	g	and then IY slope down to the left
2:39:26	2:39:28	g	IY re going about
2:39:23	2:39:31	g	and 
2:41:56	2:42:2	g	ok IY re at the savannah
2:46:5	2:46:10	g	like
2:50:51	2:50:53	f	ok
2:51:10	2:51:11	g	are IY anywhere near there 
2:53:12	2:53:18	f	ok
2:53:49	2:53:52	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
2:53:52	2:53:54	g	and 
2:54:27	2:54:32	f	to the right 
2:55:58	2:56:2	g	and that s where the plane crash is
2:58:21	2:58:29	f	ok
2:58:26	2:58:33	f	ok
2:58:53	2:58:55	g	uhm
3:2:57	3:2:57	g	you
3:3:0	3:3:1	f	ok
3:3:2	3:3:6	g	ok
3:3:41	3:3:46	f	to 
3:4:23	3:4:31	f	IY ve a plane crash though
3:5:6	3:5:12	g	uhm
3:5:11	3:5:20	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
3:5:51	3:5:57	g	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
3:6:48	3:6:49	g	maybe like
3:9:30	3:9:37	g	so
3:12:25	3:12:28	g	and then IY re going down
3:13:8	3:13:14	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
3:14:22	3:14:26	g	a quarter of an inch
3:14:45	3:14:47	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
3:14:48	3:14:55	g	and
3:15:38	3:15:38	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
3:22:9	3:22:18	g	to the lake 
3:22:34	3:22:38	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
3:23:7	3:23:9	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
3:23:10	3:23:14	g	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
3:24:20	3:24:22	g	what 
3:27:49	3:27:50	g	maybe like
3:28:35	3:28:38	g	and is to the left
3:28:35	3:28:41	g	to the right
3:33:40	3:33:48	g	hmm
3:33:48	3:33:57	f	ok
3:34:49	3:34:55	g	what 
3:34:54	3:35:2	g	ok
3:35:1	3:35:9	g	but
3:35:40	3:35:46	g	ok well
3:38:10	3:38:14	f	IY hit some rocks though
3:40:26	3:40:26	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
3:43:42	3:43:48	g	for about two inches
3:44:10	3:44:10	g	and then
3:48:47	3:48:56	g	to the left
3:48:52	3:48:57	f	IY have to back up a little bit
3:50:40	3:50:40	f	yeah
3:51:11	3:51:12	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
3:51:6	3:51:13	g	then
3:51:44	3:51:46	g	uhm
3:52:5	3:52:11	g	after IY slope down IY d say
3:54:0	3:54:3	g	uhhh no
3:56:47	3:56:53	g	ok well
3:58:4	3:58:7	g	no IY don t have a waterhole
3:58:44	3:58:52	f	how many inches do IY think 
3:59:10	3:59:11	g	four or five inches to the left
3:59:38	3:59:47	f	mm hmm
4:4:12	4:4:14	g	yes IY re going towards the lake
4:5:44	4:5:53	g	ok
4:9:16	4:9:19	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
4:9:29	4:9:35	g	an inch maybe a little bit less
4:10:29	4:10:29	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
4:11:21	4:11:23	g	and then
4:11:16	4:11:24	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
4:11:31	4:11:35	g	alright 
4:13:29	4:13:37	g	alright alright well just
4:13:51	4:13:51	g	uhm
4:15:23	4:15:31	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
4:15:40	4:15:46	g	maybe IY have different things
4:18:44	4:18:48	g	IY go straight down
4:21:21	4:21:24	f	yeah 
4:22:20	4:22:28	g	well
4:23:26	4:23:33	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
4:23:51	4:23:52	g	uhm
4:23:49	4:23:55	f	and to the right 
4:26:57	4:27:3	f	IY go to a lake 
4:30:59	4:31:8	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
4:31:30	4:31:37	g	they re there
4:31:46	4:31:47	g	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
4:32:14	4:32:23	g	IY would say
4:32:30	4:32:35	g	ok and then IY re going
4:32:53	4:32:53	g	IY move to the left
4:33:19	4:33:24	g	and IY just go straight up
4:33:22	4:33:29	f	mm hmm
4:35:19	4:35:25	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
4:35:33	4:35:37	g	kind of across from stony desert
4:36:23	4:36:26	g	IY re at the plane crash
4:36:44	4:36:46	f	and then what 
4:37:2	4:37:6	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
4:38:11	4:38:20	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
4:39:44	4:39:46	g	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
4:40:4	4:40:7	g	to the left
4:40:42	4:40:51	f	ok
4:41:35	4:41:36	g	no there s no elephants
4:42:56	4:43:1	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
4:42:59	4:43:6	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
4:43:31	4:43:39	g	so anyway
4:43:41	4:43:47	g	uhm
4:48:56	4:49:3	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
4:49:9	4:49:17	g	and IY should have a straight line there
4:49:16	4:49:22	g	after plane crash
4:49:50	4:49:57	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
4:51:37	4:51:42	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
4:52:2	4:52:7	f	mm hmm
4:54:4	4:54:4	g	for like
4:54:5	4:54:10	g	ok
4:55:21	4:55:25	g	three inches straight across
4:55:57	4:56:6	g	and IY go to the left a little bit
4:57:21	4:57:26	f	around the top of the lake 
4:57:57	4:58:3	g	ok
4:58:56	4:58:58	f	oh
4:59:53	5:0:0	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
5:0:8	5:0:9	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
5:0:59	5:1:8	g	alright 
5:3:11	5:3:11	f	to the left
5:3:25	5:3:32	g	to the left
5:4:38	5:4:41	g	ok
5:5:48	5:5:53	f	 IY m at the savannah
5:7:16	5:7:17	g	IY re starting at the stony desert
5:7:51	5:7:54	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
5:7:54	5:7:57	g	ok
5:8:27	5:8:29	g	yes
5:9:26	5:9:31	f	yeah

5:18:1	5:18:5	g	and IY re going up like
5:18:50	5:18:58	g	IY slope down again
5:19:3	5:19:7	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
5:21:30	5:21:34	g	three inches
5:22:27	5:22:33	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
5:22:29	5:22:35	g	from
5:23:30	5:23:33	g	uhm
5:23:45	5:23:53	g	ok
5:25:59	5:26:8	g	for like

5:28:13	5:28:22	f	yeah IY see that
5:29:27	5:29:33	g	IY just kind of slope down
5:31:19	5:31:20	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
5:31:19	5:31:24	f	around the lake to the top 
5:31:32	5:31:41	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
5:32:13	5:32:14	g	it s not a big curve
5:32:40	5:32:42	g	like IY re sloping
5:33:24	5:33:25	f	yep
5:34:8	5:34:16	g	and there s a plane crash
5:36:29	5:36:36	f	yeah
5:36:42	5:36:48	g	and then
5:37:36	5:37:45	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
5:40:30	5:40:39	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
5:41:33	5:41:41	g	well alright
5:42:8	5:42:17	g	like maybe an inch
5:42:17	5:42:22	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
5:42:55	5:42:59	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
5:43:0	5:43:5	g	like
5:45:2	5:45:4	g	no
5:52:40	5:52:45	f	ok
5:58:46	5:58:49	g	do IY have roman baths 
5:59:55	5:59:59	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
6:0:45	6:0:54	g	to the white mountain
6:1:1	6:1:5	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
6:2:23	6:2:27	g	and then IY are
6:5:27	6:5:33	g	it s right next to it
6:6:22	6:6:22	g	and then IY  IY go up
