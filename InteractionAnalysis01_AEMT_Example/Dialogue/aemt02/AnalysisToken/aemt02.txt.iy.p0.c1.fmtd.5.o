start
0:0:42	0:0:49	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
0:1:41	0:1:42	f	mm  mm
0:3:46	0:3:54	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
0:4:27	0:4:36	f	ok
0:4:42	0:4:46	g	IY re going about
0:7:8	0:7:9	g	that s about five or six inches
0:7:20	0:7:20	g	like three inches 
0:7:32	0:7:32	g	and then
0:7:59	0:8:6	f	ok
0:8:18	0:8:24	g	after IY slope down IY d say
0:8:31	0:8:38	f	nope IY have a white mountain
0:11:2	0:11:3	g	ok
0:13:40	0:13:41	g	ok
0:14:26	0:14:33	f	and then what 
0:15:30	0:15:33	g	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
0:16:38	0:16:45	g	couple miles or something
0:17:45	0:17:50	g	and then IY  IY go up
0:18:8	0:18:10	f	IY hit some round rocks
0:18:4	0:18:12	g	no IY have  
0:20:53	0:21:1	g	ok
0:20:54	0:21:2	g	IY got that 
0:21:30	0:21:37	g	for like
0:22:35	0:22:38	g	IY re actually starting like right
0:22:57	0:23:5	f	yeah and IY went straight up
0:25:25	0:25:32	g	not right at the stony desert
0:25:35	0:25:39	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
0:26:7	0:26:7	g	maybe like
0:26:11	0:26:12	f	 IY m at the savannah
0:26:16	0:26:21	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
0:30:30	0:30:36	g	so IY go three inches straight
0:30:30	0:30:39	g	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
0:30:53	0:30:58	g	ok well
0:32:19	0:32:28	g	ok
0:32:41	0:32:41	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
0:33:25	0:33:27	f	to the left of the antelope
0:33:26	0:33:33	g	and then IY slope up
0:33:55	0:34:2	f	up tp the right
0:37:19	0:37:27	g	uhm
0:37:48	0:37:57	g	uhm
0:38:7	0:38:11	f	so wait
0:38:19	0:38:26	g	that s IY little slope
0:38:21	0:38:26	g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
0:38:24	0:38:31	g	well just
0:39:10	0:39:13	f	mm hmm
0:39:16	0:39:22	g	so
0:39:32	0:39:39	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
0:40:40	0:40:40	f	and
0:40:34	0:40:43	g	straight up
0:40:42	0:40:51	g	and then
0:41:51	0:41:56	g	to the right
0:42:21	0:42:22	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
0:44:9	0:44:17	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
0:44:17	0:44:25	g	uhm
0:44:55	0:45:1	g	are IY  
0:47:5	0:47:14	g	so IY make that circle
0:47:14	0:47:15	g	ok
0:49:41	0:49:50	g	uhm
0:49:52	0:50:1	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
0:50:26	0:50:32	f	around the top of the lake 
0:50:32	0:50:38	g	and is to the left
0:50:41	0:50:41	g	for about two inches
0:51:18	0:51:18	g	and IY go to the left a little bit
0:55:29	0:55:32	f	mm hmm
0:57:57	0:58:4	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
0:58:18	0:58:20	g	a little bit too
0:59:8	0:59:9	g	uhm
0:59:28	0:59:29	g	and then
1:0:1	1:0:5	f	ok
1:1:20	1:1:20	f	yeah 
1:1:24	1:1:33	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
1:2:9	1:2:12	g	IY don t know
1:5:17	1:5:19	g	and
1:8:37	1:8:44	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
1:11:26	1:11:28	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
1:12:20	1:12:22	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
1:13:13	1:13:18	f	ok
1:13:9	1:13:18	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
1:13:47	1:13:52	g	three inches
1:15:35	1:15:41	f	how many inches do IY think 
1:16:41	1:16:43	g	ok
1:17:21	1:17:21	f	ok
1:17:23	1:17:26	f	ok
1:18:50	1:18:50	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
1:21:27	1:21:34	g	like
1:22:58	1:23:6	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
1:23:20	1:23:28	g	from
1:24:1	1:24:1	f	ok
1:26:50	1:26:53	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
1:26:57	1:27:2	g	and then IY go straight
1:27:43	1:27:48	f	and to the right 
1:29:7	1:29:16	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
1:29:15	1:29:22	g	like
1:29:18	1:29:27	g	IY re sloping
1:30:14	1:30:17	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
1:30:26	1:30:34	g	uhm
1:32:41	1:32:50	g	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
1:35:21	1:35:30	f	IY have to back up a little bit
1:35:34	1:35:40	g	ok
1:36:55	1:36:59	g	and then IY go
1:37:28	1:37:29	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
1:39:58	1:40:6	g	ok
1:43:38	1:43:43	g	uhm
1:46:34	1:46:36	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
1:48:54	1:48:58	f	elephants 
1:48:54	1:48:59	f	yeah
1:50:33	1:50:34	f	yeah
1:51:41	1:51:44	g	to the left
1:52:13	1:52:13	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
1:54:12	1:54:13	g	ok IY re at the savannah
1:58:45	1:58:48	g	IY wanna kind of curve
2:1:5	2:1:11	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
2:2:2	2:2:11	g	IY would say
2:4:52	2:4:56	g	uhm
2:6:26	2:6:26	f	and curve down to the left 
2:7:54	2:8:3	g	and IY re sloping to the left
2:8:8	2:8:9	f	ok
2:8:26	2:8:29	f	IY hit some rocks though
2:9:11	2:9:15	f	to the left
2:10:14	2:10:21	g	and that s where the plane crash is
2:11:40	2:11:42	f	ok
2:12:21	2:12:30	g	IY make
2:12:48	2:12:49	f	ok
2:13:34	2:13:37	g	uhm
2:13:34	2:13:42	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
2:14:5	2:14:14	g	and IY should have a straight line there
2:15:56	2:16:0	g	IY re starting at the stony desert
2:15:59	2:16:1	g	and 
2:16:43	2:16:47	g	ok 
2:18:30	2:18:38	g	ok
2:18:33	2:18:42	g	and
2:18:46	2:18:50	g	and then IY slope
2:20:15	2:20:17	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
2:20:43	2:20:46	f	ok
2:21:5	2:21:10	f	ok
2:22:34	2:22:42	g	IY plane crash 
2:28:22	2:28:31	g	ok
2:29:2	2:29:5	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
2:30:24	2:30:33	g	IY go straight down
2:33:2	2:33:2	g	three inches straight across
2:34:37	2:34:45	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
2:34:49	2:34:53	f	ok
2:35:22	2:35:22	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
2:35:25	2:35:32	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
2:36:40	2:36:45	g	IY move to the left
2:37:57	2:38:4	f	ok
2:39:17	2:39:26	g	a little
2:40:4	2:40:12	g	to IY right 
2:40:27	2:40:27	f	ok
2:40:40	2:40:46	g	like four or five inches to the left
2:44:31	2:44:37	g	about like
2:45:15	2:45:23	g	and IY re going
2:45:28	2:45:35	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
2:47:26	2:47:31	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
2:47:44	2:47:47	f	yeah
2:48:36	2:48:45	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right
2:48:56	2:48:57	f	nope
2:50:5	2:50:10	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
2:50:22	2:50:23	f	ok
2:53:12	2:53:13	g	ok and then IY re going
2:55:54	2:56:1	f	yeah
3:1:2	3:1:9	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
3:4:1	3:4:6	g	ok well
3:4:30	3:4:33	g	to the lake 
3:8:9	3:8:11	g	on IY sheet anyway
3:10:33	3:10:36	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
3:10:52	3:10:59	g	uhm
3:13:0	3:13:8	f	ok
3:13:10	3:13:17	g	so anyway
3:14:2	3:14:8	g	well
3:15:25	3:15:26	f	yeah 
3:15:45	3:15:48	g	for like
3:17:43	3:17:47	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
3:19:11	3:19:14	g	uhm
3:20:36	3:20:42	g	uhm
3:23:7	3:23:15	g	IY re going like
3:24:10	3:24:17	f	to 
3:24:56	3:24:57	g	IY re just going down
3:25:37	3:25:46	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
3:26:2	3:26:2	g	and there s a plane crash
3:27:2	3:27:8	g	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
3:27:28	3:27:36	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
3:27:36	3:27:37	g	yes
3:30:32	3:30:38	g	are IY anywhere near there 
3:31:58	3:31:59	g	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
3:32:49	3:32:51	g	like IY re sloping
3:32:55	3:32:56	f	to the right 
3:36:32	3:36:34	g	alright 
3:38:4	3:38:8	g	after plane crash
3:38:20	3:38:23	g	to the white mountain
3:39:32	3:39:37	f	ok
3:40:13	3:40:20	g	ok
3:43:8	3:43:15	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
3:43:18	3:43:20	g	ok
3:43:34	3:43:35	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
3:47:33	3:47:38	g	just do it like this ok
3:48:10	3:48:17	g	then
3:49:44	3:49:45	g	after that IY go straight again
3:50:11	3:50:17	g	uhm
3:51:10	3:51:11	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
3:52:46	3:52:54	f	ok
3:54:55	3:55:4	g	and then
3:55:45	3:55:52	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
3:57:36	3:57:43	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
3:59:7	3:59:10	f	mm hmm
3:59:37	3:59:44	g	to the left
4:0:7	4:0:12	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
4:2:44	4:2:44	f	ok
4:7:11	4:7:11	g	probably the same thing
4:7:35	4:7:35	g	it s right next to it
4:9:30	4:9:33	g	what 
4:9:31	4:9:38	g	like
4:9:56	4:10:4	g	so IY re at the hot springs
4:12:30	4:12:32	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
4:12:43	4:12:45	g	ok
4:14:34	4:14:38	g	three inches
4:15:13	4:15:13	g	ok
4:15:43	4:15:51	g	ok
4:16:10	4:16:15	f	mm hmm
4:19:15	4:19:17	g	uh like
4:19:55	4:20:1	f	ok
4:20:4	4:20:13	g	ok
4:20:20	4:20:22	f	IY know IY have different things so
4:21:19	4:21:19	g	five
4:21:56	4:22:5	g	after the circle
4:22:25	4:22:26	g	slight
4:22:46	4:22:51	g	uhhh no
4:23:39	4:23:47	g	is the plane crash  
4:23:52	4:23:54	g	no
4:26:5	4:26:12	g	like
4:27:57	4:27:59	g	and IY just go straight up
4:28:2	4:28:8	g	and then IY are
4:28:56	4:28:56	g	IY slope down again
4:30:16	4:30:22	g	are IY in like   
4:33:15	4:33:24	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
4:36:48	4:36:52	f	do IY go around it 
4:37:24	4:37:28	f	IY ve a plane crash though
4:38:32	4:38:32	g	maybe like
4:40:49	4:40:51	g	do IY have roman baths 
4:40:58	4:41:4	g	maybe four inches on the paper
4:41:15	4:41:19	g	around the bottom of it
4:41:20	4:41:27	g	IY re at the plane crash
4:44:38	4:44:46	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
4:45:29	4:45:32	g	just a slight slope
4:45:44	4:45:51	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
4:45:58	4:45:58	g	and then IY slope down to the left
4:46:1	4:46:1	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
4:46:40	4:46:47	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
4:48:7	4:48:13	g	uhm
4:51:30	4:51:37	g	well
4:52:11	4:52:15	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
4:52:36	4:52:44	g	ok
4:53:8	4:53:9	g	and then
4:53:16	4:53:20	f	ok
4:53:58	4:54:6	f	ok
4:54:16	4:54:24	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
4:56:11	4:56:12	g	like maybe an inch
4:58:19	4:58:22	g	but
4:59:44	4:59:53	f	around the lake to the top 
5:0:23	5:0:31	f	IY go to a lake 
5:0:37	5:0:44	g	and then
5:1:46	5:1:47	g	IY just kind of slope down
5:2:27	5:2:29	g	maybe
5:2:35	5:2:36	g	they re there
5:2:42	5:2:48	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
5:2:49	5:2:56	f	do IY go through anything 
5:3:21	5:3:27	g	maybe IY have different things
5:6:10	5:6:12	g	IY re kind of going  
5:9:2	5:9:7	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
5:9:12	5:9:15	f	uh IY don t know know what to say
5:9:45	5:9:54	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
5:12:4	5:12:9	g	a quarter of an inch
5:14:54	5:14:59	g	kind of across from stony desert
5:16:11	5:16:11	f	yep
5:16:25	5:16:28	g	ok
5:17:11	5:17:19	f	ok
5:17:55	5:18:3	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
5:21:17	5:21:19	g	and IY re going up like
5:22:23	5:22:26	f	ok
5:23:0	5:23:4	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
5:24:39	5:24:41	g	and then
5:26:37	5:26:39	g	IY re starting
5:27:49	5:27:56	f	IY m three inches above the savannah
5:29:4	5:29:4	g	the  
5:30:41	5:30:42	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
5:32:31	5:32:40	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
5:35:44	5:35:48	g	what 
5:35:44	5:35:53	g	an inch maybe a little bit less
5:36:12	5:36:12	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
5:36:30	5:36:31	g	four or five inches to the left
5:38:13	5:38:20	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
5:40:11	5:40:14	g	and IY re going straight up
5:40:30	5:40:38	g	so that s about IY would say
5:41:34	5:41:42	g	ok
5:42:58	5:43:0	f	oh
5:46:3	5:46:10	g	uhm
5:47:13	5:47:13	g	hmm
5:48:19	5:48:24	g	no there s no elephants
5:50:43	5:50:47	f	mm hmm
5:52:56	5:53:3	g	it s not a big curve
5:53:11	5:53:11	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
5:53:22	5:53:23	g	like an inch
5:54:5	5:54:7	g	and 
5:54:26	5:54:31	g	ok
5:55:40	5:55:43	f	yeah IY see that
5:56:54	5:56:59	f	mm hmm
5:57:2	5:57:5	g	ok
5:57:39	5:57:44	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
5:59:20	5:59:24	g	ok
5:59:47	5:59:55	f	ok
5:59:51	6:0:0	g	and then IY re going down
6:0:14	6:0:19	g	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
