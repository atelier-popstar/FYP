start
0:0:6	0:0:6	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
0:2:10	0:2:11	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
0:4:23	0:4:29	g	and
0:4:58	0:5:5	g	and then IY are
0:5:9	0:5:9	f	IY ve a plane crash though
0:5:11	0:5:12	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
0:5:21	0:5:28	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
0:8:23	0:8:26	g	like
0:9:25	0:9:28	g	ok
0:9:31	0:9:39	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
0:11:12	0:11:13	f	mm hmm
0:12:10	0:12:14	g	and 
0:12:10	0:12:16	g	and IY just go straight up
0:14:4	0:14:6	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
0:14:23	0:14:25	g	IY got that 
0:15:1	0:15:2	g	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
0:15:13	0:15:14	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
0:15:28	0:15:31	g	that s about five or six inches
0:17:42	0:17:46	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
0:19:4	0:19:13	g	and then IY slope up
0:19:54	0:19:58	g	have a s 
0:20:44	0:20:47	g	IY go straight down
0:21:13	0:21:22	f	to the left
0:22:32	0:22:34	g	after plane crash
0:22:59	0:23:7	g	so
0:23:42	0:23:44	g	after the circle
0:23:52	0:23:52	g	about like
0:25:40	0:25:41	g	ok
0:27:21	0:27:26	g	to the left
0:27:42	0:27:46	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
0:29:15	0:29:15	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
0:29:26	0:29:33	f	IY know IY have different things so
0:30:34	0:30:35	g	and then
0:31:49	0:31:55	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
0:32:47	0:32:47	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
0:33:0	0:33:7	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
0:39:42	0:39:47	g	and then IY go straight
0:42:25	0:42:28	g	uhm
0:43:36	0:43:44	g	and there s a plane crash
0:45:10	0:45:15	g	then
0:46:11	0:46:16	g	on IY sheet anyway
0:50:57	0:51:0	f	do IY go through anything 
0:51:37	0:51:41	f	nope IY have a white mountain
0:52:13	0:52:21	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
0:52:56	0:52:58	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
0:54:9	0:54:12	f	ok wait hold on
0:55:40	0:55:40	f	yeah
0:56:17	0:56:19	g	ok
0:57:22	0:57:26	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
0:58:14	0:58:14	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
0:58:43	0:58:43	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
0:59:46	0:59:50	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
1:0:10	1:0:19	g	four or five inches to the left
1:0:39	1:0:48	g	are IY in like   
1:2:17	1:2:17	f	ok
1:2:34	1:2:42	g	and IY re going up like
1:4:54	1:4:58	g	and then IY  IY go up
1:5:51	1:5:59	g	uhm
1:5:53	1:6:2	g	so IY make that circle
1:6:11	1:6:19	g	well alright
1:10:1	1:10:1	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
1:10:56	1:10:58	g	what 
1:11:10	1:11:13	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
1:11:10	1:11:17	f	ok
1:13:5	1:13:11	g	alright 
1:13:3	1:13:11	f	mm hmm
1:13:28	1:13:37	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
1:14:43	1:14:45	g	like
1:16:1	1:16:2	g	ok
1:17:5	1:17:6	f	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
1:17:10	1:17:19	g	is the plane crash  
1:18:0	1:18:3	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
1:18:23	1:18:28	g	uhm
1:18:34	1:18:43	g	uhm
1:20:52	1:20:57	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
1:20:58	1:21:7	g	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
1:21:6	1:21:12	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
1:21:26	1:21:34	g	ok
1:22:37	1:22:37	g	after IY slope down IY d say
1:23:14	1:23:17	g	maybe IY have different things
1:24:37	1:24:46	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
1:25:21	1:25:28	f	IY hit some rocks though
1:26:41	1:26:48	f	ok
1:29:20	1:29:24	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
1:29:29	1:29:37	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
1:29:32	1:29:41	f	mm hmm
1:35:42	1:35:42	g	a little
1:35:37	1:35:46	g	ok 
1:36:10	1:36:16	g	ok
1:36:39	1:36:42	f	ok
1:38:44	1:38:53	g	no IY don t have any rocks
1:38:52	1:38:58	g	uhm
1:45:1	1:45:5	g	three inches straight across
1:45:41	1:45:50	f	ok
1:45:59	1:46:3	f	mm hmm
1:47:19	1:47:26	g	five
1:47:39	1:47:42	g	and then IY slope down to the left
1:49:52	1:49:56	g	after that IY go straight again
1:50:6	1:50:11	f	ok
1:50:55	1:50:58	g	ok
1:55:32	1:55:36	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
1:57:35	1:57:41	g	that s IY little slope
1:58:50	1:58:55	g	IY plane crash 
1:59:43	1:59:43	g	the  
2:1:31	2:1:39	g	no
2:2:7	2:2:8	g	do IY have roman baths 
2:3:34	2:3:34	f	ok
2:4:14	2:4:19	g	like
2:4:22	2:4:31	g	like IY re sloping
2:5:2	2:5:2	f	so wait
2:5:58	2:6:6	f	mm hmm
2:7:8	2:7:15	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
2:7:46	2:7:50	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
2:8:12	2:8:16	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
2:9:10	2:9:11	g	like four or five inches to the left
2:12:17	2:12:24	g	it s not a big curve
2:12:24	2:12:32	g	uhm
2:13:8	2:13:9	g	slight
2:13:1	2:13:9	g	so IY go three inches straight
2:14:14	2:14:14	f	oh
2:14:22	2:14:22	g	and IY re going straight up
2:14:40	2:14:47	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
2:16:53	2:16:58	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
2:17:28	2:17:32	f	uhm my
2:17:47	2:17:55	g	no IY have  
2:19:21	2:19:27	g	and

2:23:25	2:23:28	g	uhm
2:23:54	2:23:54	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
2:24:56	2:24:57	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
2:25:11	2:25:18	f	ok
2:26:15	2:26:16	f	up tp the right
2:27:16	2:27:20	g	like an inch
2:27:55	2:28:0	g	IY just kind of slope down
2:28:16	2:28:16	g	no there s no elephants
2:28:52	2:28:58	g	and then
2:30:8	2:30:9	g	well
2:31:47	2:31:52	g	just a slight slope
2:32:16	2:32:17	f	ok
2:35:18	2:35:23	f	to the left of the antelope
2:36:38	2:36:46	g	ok
2:39:59	2:40:1	g	couple miles or something
2:43:19	2:43:26	g	and IY re going
2:43:52	2:43:53	g	and then IY slope
2:45:34	2:45:36	g	uhm
2:46:42	2:46:50	g	IY re sloping
2:47:19	2:47:28	g	uhm

2:47:36	2:47:45	f	yeah 
2:48:38	2:48:44	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
2:50:8	2:50:17	f	mm hmm
2:50:55	2:50:58	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
2:51:11	2:51:18	g	IY make
2:53:11	2:53:16	f	yeah and IY went straight up
2:53:31	2:53:39	g	uh like
2:53:53	2:54:0	f	IY have to back up a little bit
2:53:57	2:54:2	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
2:55:1	2:55:2	g	are IY  
2:57:4	2:57:12	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
2:58:3	2:58:8	g	ok well
2:59:40	2:59:47	f	ok
3:3:2	3:3:7	g	to the white mountain
3:4:12	3:4:13	g	and then
3:4:40	3:4:49	g	uhm
3:5:54	3:6:1	g	uhm
3:6:37	3:6:43	g	IY re going like

3:9:42	3:9:51	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
3:10:34	3:10:39	g	and then
3:11:19	3:11:26	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
3:12:23	3:12:30	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
3:12:44	3:12:46	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
3:13:23	3:13:30	g	and IY go to the left a little bit
3:13:35	3:13:41	g	there s a there s  
3:13:44	3:13:44	g	ok

3:22:2	3:22:5	f	and
3:22:19	3:22:27	g	maybe four inches on the paper
3:23:11	3:23:19	g	like maybe an inch
3:23:15	3:23:23	f	mm  mm
3:24:7	3:24:7	g	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
3:24:8	3:24:16	g	IY move to the left
3:24:57	3:25:0	g	to the right
3:25:32	3:25:34	g	no

3:29:32	3:29:36	g	ok
3:30:17	3:30:19	f	IY go to a lake 
3:31:15	3:31:22	g	so that s about IY would say
3:31:24	3:31:32	g	and IY should have a straight line there
3:32:23	3:32:24	g	and then
3:32:38	3:32:39	g	IY wanna kind of curve
3:39:32	3:39:39	g	and is to the left
3:39:41	3:39:48	g	ok

3:41:3	3:41:7	f	elephants 
3:41:29	3:41:35	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
3:42:31	3:42:38	g	and then IY go
3:46:6	3:46:15	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
3:47:6	3:47:15	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
3:47:13	3:47:19	g	for like
3:48:18	3:48:22	g	are IY anywere near there 
3:49:35	3:49:42	g	ok
3:50:34	3:50:39	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
3:54:19	3:54:21	g	and then
3:54:30	3:54:35	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
3:55:33	3:55:41	g	IY re going about
3:58:57	3:59:1	f	yeah
4:3:13	4:3:20	g	and IY re sloping to the left
4:3:21	4:3:28	g	so IY re at the hot springs
4:6:6	4:6:14	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right
4:7:9	4:7:18	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
4:7:20	4:7:28	g	to IY right 
4:7:53	4:7:53	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
4:7:53	4:7:59	g	from
4:8:28	4:8:35	g	to the left
4:9:15	4:9:24	g	uhm
4:9:38	4:9:42	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
4:11:49	4:11:53	g	a little bit too
4:13:22	4:13:29	g	and then IY re going down
4:13:49	4:13:56	f	ok
4:14:2	4:14:10	g	kind of across from stony desert
4:14:6	4:14:12	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
4:14:43	4:14:46	g	uhm
4:15:45	4:15:49	g	they re there
4:16:4	4:16:7	g	ok
4:16:52	4:17:0	g	not right at the stony desert
4:17:34	4:17:34	f	yeah 
4:17:34	4:17:36	g	to the left
4:17:44	4:17:47	f	do IY go around it 
4:18:59	4:19:4	g	around the bottom of it
4:20:26	4:20:35	g	ok well
4:21:49	4:21:53	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
4:22:34	4:22:34	f	yep
4:26:10	4:26:11	f	and curve down to the left 
4:27:28	4:27:31	g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
4:27:28	4:27:32	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches

4:32:21	4:32:24	g	well
4:32:50	4:32:59	f	IY hit some round rocks
4:34:56	4:35:1	g	just do it like this ok
4:35:2	4:35:7	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
4:35:54	4:35:55	g	but
4:36:19	4:36:24	g	like three inches 
4:36:19	4:36:26	g	uhm
4:37:1	4:37:1	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
4:37:25	4:37:30	g	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
4:38:46	4:38:48	g	ok
4:39:27	4:39:33	g	ok
4:39:50	4:39:55	g	hmm

5:11:34	5:11:36	g	IY re at the plane crash
5:12:1	5:12:1	g	three inches
5:12:10	5:12:18	g	uhm
5:12:47	5:12:49	g	yes IY re going towards the lake

5:30:59	5:31:1	g	uhm
5:31:7	5:31:9	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
5:31:43	5:31:44	g	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
5:34:41	5:34:50	g	maybe like
5:35:11	5:35:13	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left

5:52:30	5:52:37	g	ok IY re at the savannah
5:53:42	5:53:48	g	and that s where the plane crash is
5:54:3	5:54:8	g	IY re starting
