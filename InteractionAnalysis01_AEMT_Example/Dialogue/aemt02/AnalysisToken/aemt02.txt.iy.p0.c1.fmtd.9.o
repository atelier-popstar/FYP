start
0:1:9	0:1:17	g	uh like
0:1:43	0:1:45	g	three inches
0:1:54	0:2:0	g	and then IY go straight
0:2:5	0:2:5	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
0:2:22	0:2:30	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
0:2:34	0:2:38	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
0:5:16	0:5:16	g	and then IY slope up
0:5:54	0:5:55	g	maybe four inches on the paper
0:6:39	0:6:39	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
0:7:27	0:7:34	g	IY got that 
0:11:50	0:11:56	g	uhm
0:12:41	0:12:48	g	are IY in like   
0:13:1	0:13:9	f	yep
0:16:2	0:16:10	f	yeah and IY went straight up
0:16:15	0:16:20	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
0:16:45	0:16:51	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
0:16:55	0:16:57	g	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
0:22:10	0:22:15	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
0:23:1	0:23:2	f	ok
0:26:1	0:26:3	g	ok
0:26:41	0:26:43	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
0:26:59	0:27:7	f	ok
0:27:43	0:27:44	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
0:29:38	0:29:42	g	ok
0:30:19	0:30:20	g	yes
0:31:10	0:31:19	g	so IY go three inches straight
0:31:26	0:31:34	g	around the bottom of it
0:32:13	0:32:13	f	ok
0:33:59	0:34:1	g	is the plane crash  
0:35:43	0:35:44	g	ok
0:36:2	0:36:7	f	IY know IY have different things so
0:39:16	0:39:17	f	ok
0:42:6	0:42:10	g	an inch maybe a little bit less
0:42:14	0:42:15	g	uhm
0:42:24	0:42:29	f	ok
0:43:24	0:43:32	f	do IY go around it 
0:47:10	0:47:11	g	a quarter of an inch
0:48:9	0:48:13	g	not right at the stony desert
0:49:0	0:49:6	g	like
0:49:39	0:49:45	f	ok
0:50:14	0:50:20	g	the  
0:50:46	0:50:48	g	IY don t know
0:51:16	0:51:18	g	yes
0:51:17	0:51:23	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
0:51:34	0:51:36	f	yeah

0:54:21	0:54:26	g	ok
0:55:18	0:55:19	f	ok
0:55:33	0:55:38	g	maybe like
0:55:50	0:55:55	f	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
1:0:38	1:0:39	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
1:1:8	1:1:8	f	ok
1:4:21	1:4:28	g	uhm
1:5:48	1:5:51	g	alright 
1:6:36	1:6:44	f	to the left
1:6:49	1:6:51	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
1:10:40	1:10:47	g	IY would say
1:11:42	1:11:45	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
1:11:46	1:11:47	g	and
1:12:28	1:12:28	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
1:13:51	1:13:51	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
1:13:47	1:13:54	g	IY re going like
1:17:7	1:17:16	g	uhm
1:17:47	1:17:56	g	and is to the left
1:18:29	1:18:30	g	ok and then IY re going
1:21:15	1:21:15	g	uhm
1:21:46	1:21:51	g	just a slight slope
1:23:8	1:23:11	g	but
1:23:21	1:23:21	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
1:24:13	1:24:14	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
1:25:38	1:25:43	g	straight up
1:27:28	1:27:34	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
1:29:19	1:29:20	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
1:29:25	1:29:26	f	to 
1:29:38	1:29:41	f	ok
1:29:43	1:29:44	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
1:33:33	1:33:33	g	alright 
1:34:6	1:34:6	g	uhm
1:34:9	1:34:12	f	mm  mm
1:35:24	1:35:30	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
1:36:53	1:36:56	g	and IY should have a straight line there
1:37:4	1:37:11	g	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
1:37:10	1:37:14	f	uh IY don t know know what to say
1:37:45	1:37:50	g	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
1:39:41	1:39:45	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
1:40:46	1:40:48	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
1:42:20	1:42:21	g	no IY have  
1:44:31	1:44:40	g	are IY anywhere near there 
1:45:20	1:45:25	f	nope
1:47:23	1:47:32	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
1:47:28	1:47:34	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
1:47:36	1:47:36	g	on IY sheet anyway
1:48:28	1:48:28	g	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
1:49:11	1:49:20	g	ok
1:51:35	1:51:43	g	IY re starting at the stony desert
1:52:11	1:52:13	g	and then IY slope down to the left
1:54:34	1:54:40	g	IY re kind of going  
1:54:40	1:54:41	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
1:55:24	1:55:25	g	to the lake 
1:55:47	1:55:54	g	to the white mountain
1:58:31	1:58:33	g	so that s about IY would say
1:59:34	1:59:43	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
1:59:57	1:59:58	g	and IY re going straight up
2:0:22	2:0:28	g	and 
2:2:58	2:3:2	g	ok
2:3:42	2:3:42	g	no IY don t have any rocks
2:5:25	2:5:28	g	for about two inches
2:5:41	2:5:41	g	IY re actually starting like right
2:5:47	2:5:51	f	elephants 
2:6:27	2:6:34	g	IY go straight down
2:7:9	2:7:11	f	do IY go through anything 
2:7:58	2:8:1	g	so IY re at the hot springs
2:12:48	2:12:53	f	mm hmm
2:12:56	2:13:2	g	have a s 
2:12:57	2:13:4	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
2:15:17	2:15:23	f	mm hmm
2:17:52	2:17:55	g	and then
2:19:23	2:19:24	g	like IY re sloping
2:19:26	2:19:26	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
2:19:27	2:19:29	g	so anyway
2:19:33	2:19:35	g	hmm
2:21:36	2:21:44	g	well alright
2:26:3	2:26:3	g	to the left
2:26:30	2:26:35	g	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
2:27:33	2:27:41	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
2:29:25	2:29:34	g	IY slope down again
2:30:33	2:30:41	f	IY go to a lake 
2:31:7	2:31:15	f	nope IY have a white mountain
2:32:38	2:32:39	g	no

2:55:4	2:55:11	g	are IY anywere near there 
2:56:4	2:56:10	f	IY ve a plane crash though
2:56:11	2:56:18	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
2:56:37	2:56:46	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
2:58:46	2:58:55	g	about like
2:59:1	2:59:7	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
3:0:48	3:0:51	g	ok
3:1:29	3:1:35	f	ok
3:3:2	3:3:2	g	after IY slope down IY d say
3:3:41	3:3:50	g	it s right next to it
3:4:7	3:4:16	f	around the top of the lake 
3:6:3	3:6:4	g	three inches straight across
3:8:1	3:8:8	g	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
3:10:39	3:10:46	f	mm hmm

3:17:1	3:17:2	f	oh
3:18:33	3:18:42	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
3:19:11	3:19:16	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
3:21:39	3:21:47	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right

3:31:39	3:31:44	g	and there s a plane crash
3:31:53	3:31:57	g	ok
3:32:50	3:32:56	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
3:32:59	3:33:1	g	what

3:34:20	3:34:25	f	ok
3:37:53	3:37:55	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
3:38:37	3:38:46	g	and then IY slope
3:39:5	3:39:13	f	IY hit some round rocks
3:41:11	3:41:20	g	to the left

3:54:5	3:54:10	g	they re there
3:54:40	3:54:43	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
3:56:19	3:56:20	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
3:56:35	3:56:37	g	couple miles or something
3:56:46	3:56:52	g	a little bit too
3:56:45	3:56:53	f	and then what

4:11:7	4:11:14	g	like
4:13:46	4:13:53	g	after plane crash
4:14:17	4:14:20	g	and IY re going
4:14:23	4:14:25	f	mm hmm
4:14:33	4:14:35	g	probably the same thing

4:30:39	4:30:48	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
4:32:20	4:32:25	f	to the left of the antelope
4:32:38	4:32:46	g	ok
4:34:29	4:34:29	g	to the right
4:35:9	4:35:17	f	ok

4:51:2	4:51:3	g	no there s no elephants
4:52:58	4:52:58	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
4:53:30	4:53:35	f	IY m three inches above the savannah
4:54:46	4:54:54	f	ok
4:54:48	4:54:55	f	yeah 
4:57:51	4:57:52	g	four or five inches to the left
4:58:50	4:58:57	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
5:2:12	5:2:14	g	IY re at the plane crash
5:3:49	5:3:50	g	ok
5:6:7	5:6:11	g	slight
5:7:56	5:7:58	g	a little
5:9:15	5:9:22	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
5:10:32	5:10:34	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
5:11:4	5:11:12	g	after the circle
5:12:51	5:13:0	g	for like
5:14:39	5:14:45	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
5:14:47	5:14:51	f	and curve down to the left 
5:17:43	5:17:45	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
5:17:55	5:17:55	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
5:18:16	5:18:22	g	and IY re sloping to the left
5:19:6	5:19:7	g	maybe
5:24:7	5:24:7	f	around the lake to the top 
5:25:44	5:25:47	g	uhm
5:27:10	5:27:14	f	ok
5:27:24	5:27:30	g	IY move to the left

5:29:7	5:29:14	g	and then IY  IY go up
5:29:11	5:29:18	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
5:32:31	5:32:36	g	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
5:34:11	5:34:19	f	IY have to back up a little bit
5:34:38	5:34:41	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
5:35:22	5:35:30	g	and then
5:35:45	5:35:49	g	and then
5:36:31	5:36:39	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
5:36:54	5:36:56	g	and that s where the plane crash is
5:38:10	5:38:15	g	uhm
5:43:6	5:43:8	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
5:43:31	5:43:38	g	ok
5:43:58	5:43:59	g	that s IY little slope
5:46:28	5:46:29	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
5:47:4	5:47:12	g	uhm
5:47:44	5:47:46	g	maybe IY have different things
5:48:13	5:48:21	g	well
5:49:39	5:49:40	g	ok well
5:50:25	5:50:32	g	ok IY re at the savannah
5:51:0	5:51:7	g	so IY make that circle
5:51:15	5:51:22	g	like four or five inches to the left
5:54:22	5:54:26	g	ok
5:55:49	5:55:58	f	ok
5:57:4	5:57:5	f	up tp the right
