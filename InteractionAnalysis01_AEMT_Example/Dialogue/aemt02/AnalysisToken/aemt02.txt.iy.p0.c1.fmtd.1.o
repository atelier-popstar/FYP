1:1:43	1:3:33	g	IY re starting
1:3:33	1:4:43	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
1:4:43	1:6:25	g	IY re actually starting like right
1:6:25	1:7:47	g	uhm
1:7:47	1:8:7	g	kind of across from stony desert
1:8:7	1:9:24	g	and
1:9:24	1:10:20	g	IY re kind of going  
1:10:20	1:11:16	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
1:11:16	1:11:17	g	and IY re going
1:11:17	1:13:7	g	IY would say
1:13:7	1:13:12	g	maybe
1:13:12	1:14:51	g	couple miles or something
1:14:51	1:15:18	g	from
1:15:18	1:16:30	g	uhm
1:16:30	1:17:29	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
1:17:29	1:18:38	g	uhm
1:18:38	1:18:47	g	there s a there s  
1:18:47	1:19:53	f	ok wait hold on
1:19:53	1:21:45	g	ok
1:21:45	1:23:19	f	IY have to back up a little bit
1:23:19	1:23:52	g	ok
1:23:52	1:24:33	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
1:24:33	1:25:11	f	ok
1:25:11	1:26:32	g	and IY go to the left a little bit
1:26:32	1:28:0	g	and then
1:28:0	1:28:50	g	uhm
1:28:50	1:29:13	g	IY just kind of slope down
1:29:13	1:30:42	g	a little bit too
1:30:42	1:31:16	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
1:31:16	1:33:15	g	after IY slope down IY d say
1:33:15	1:34:6	g	like
1:34:6	1:35:33	g	maybe like
1:35:33	1:35:48	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
1:35:48	1:37:15	g	and then IY go straight
1:37:15	1:39:14	g	for like
1:39:14	1:40:40	g	like
1:40:40	1:41:0	g	five
1:41:0	1:42:7	g	maybe four inches on the paper
1:42:7	1:42:24	g	and there s a plane crash
1:42:24	1:43:36	f	uhm my
1:43:36	1:44:43	f	uh IY don t know know what to say
1:44:43	1:45:39	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
1:45:39	1:46:42	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
1:46:42	1:48:2	g	IY plane crash 
1:48:2	1:49:34	f	mm  mm
1:49:34	1:50:8	g	uhm
1:50:8	1:52:5	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
1:52:5	1:53:49	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
1:53:49	1:55:19	g	are IY  
1:55:19	1:57:2	g	IY re starting at the stony desert
1:57:2	1:58:3	f	yeah
1:58:3	1:58:13	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
1:58:13	1:59:21	f	and
1:59:21	2:0:18	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
2:0:18	2:2:8	g	not right at the stony desert
2:2:8	2:3:12	f	yeah 
2:3:12	2:3:37	g	ok and then IY re going
2:3:37	2:4:51	f	ok
2:4:51	2:6:31	g	to the left
2:6:31	2:8:21	g	like an inch
2:8:21	2:10:7	g	and then IY re going down
2:10:7	2:11:52	g	like maybe an inch
2:11:52	2:13:21	g	that s IY little slope
2:13:21	2:13:45	f	ok
2:13:45	2:14:24	g	and then IY go
2:14:24	2:16:4	g	like four or five inches to the left
2:16:4	2:17:15	g	and that s where the plane crash is
2:17:15	2:18:44	g	are IY anywhere near there 
2:18:44	2:19:52	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
2:19:52	2:20:45	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
2:20:45	2:22:35	g	four or five inches to the left
2:22:35	2:23:34	f	ok
2:23:34	2:25:17	g	and then
2:25:17	2:25:31	g	after plane crash
2:25:31	2:25:40	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
2:25:40	2:26:3	f	ok
2:26:3	2:27:39	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
2:27:39	2:28:19	g	uhm
2:28:19	2:29:18	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
2:29:18	2:30:54	g	alright 
2:30:54	2:32:5	g	so
2:32:5	2:32:6	g	uhm
2:32:6	2:33:25	g	IY re at the plane crash
2:33:25	2:34:30	g	and
2:34:30	2:34:57	g	IY wanna kind of curve
2:34:57	2:36:35	g	a little
2:36:35	2:37:28	g	to the left
2:37:28	2:39:5	g	and then IY  IY go up
2:39:5	2:39:51	g	and IY re going up like
2:39:51	2:40:28	g	three inches
2:40:28	2:42:20	f	mm hmm
2:42:20	2:44:0	g	and 
2:44:0	2:45:5	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
2:45:5	2:46:32	g	it s not a big curve
2:46:32	2:48:19	f	ok
2:48:19	2:49:4	g	ok
2:49:4	2:49:40	g	and then
2:49:40	2:50:27	g	uhm
2:50:27	2:51:53	g	after that IY go straight again
2:51:53	2:52:26	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
2:52:26	2:53:30	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
2:53:30	2:53:43	g	are IY anywere near there 
2:53:43	2:54:33	f	yeah IY see that
2:54:33	2:55:8	g	ok
2:55:8	2:55:55	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
2:55:55	2:57:3	g	yes
2:57:3	2:57:44	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
2:57:44	2:57:54	g	yes
2:57:54	2:59:31	f	ok
2:59:31	3:0:47	g	ok
3:0:47	3:1:13	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
3:1:13	3:1:14	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right
3:1:14	3:1:31	g	just a slight slope
3:1:31	3:2:38	g	about like
3:2:38	3:3:17	g	an inch maybe a little bit less
3:3:17	3:4:6	f	to the right 
3:4:6	3:5:28	g	to the right
3:5:28	3:6:28	g	IY re sloping
3:6:28	3:7:58	f	ok
3:7:58	3:7:59	f	and then what 
3:7:59	3:8:6	g	ok
3:8:6	3:9:31	g	and then
3:9:31	3:10:45	g	you
3:10:45	3:11:4	g	have a s 
3:11:4	3:11:21	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
3:11:21	3:12:32	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
3:12:32	3:14:5	f	mm hmm
3:14:5	3:15:1	g	slight
3:15:1	3:16:29	g	uhm
3:16:29	3:17:4	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
3:17:4	3:17:46	f	ok
3:17:46	3:19:16	g	ok
3:19:16	3:20:17	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
3:20:17	3:21:32	g	uhhh no
3:21:32	3:22:14	g	no IY don t have a waterhole
3:22:14	3:23:1	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
3:23:1	3:23:4	f	yeah
3:23:4	3:25:1	g	well
3:25:1	3:25:2	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
3:25:2	3:25:28	f	yeah 
3:25:28	3:25:28	g	ok
3:25:28	3:26:17	f	 IY m at the savannah
3:26:17	3:27:7	g	ok IY re at the savannah
3:27:7	3:28:8	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
3:28:8	3:29:28	g	like
3:29:28	3:30:9	g	three inches
3:30:9	3:30:23	f	ok
3:30:23	3:30:40	g	and IY re going straight up
3:30:40	3:31:40	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
3:31:40	3:32:7	f	nope IY have a white mountain
3:32:7	3:32:30	g	ok well
3:32:30	3:33:18	g	probably the same thing
3:33:18	3:33:26	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
3:33:26	3:33:45	f	to the left
3:33:45	3:35:27	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
3:35:27	3:36:51	f	yeah and IY went straight up
3:36:51	3:38:23	g	straight up
3:38:23	3:39:53	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
3:39:53	3:40:28	g	hmm
3:40:28	3:41:9	g	well
3:41:9	3:42:39	g	IY don t know
3:42:39	3:44:18	g	alright 
3:44:18	3:45:28	g	well just
3:45:28	3:47:0	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
3:47:0	3:48:32	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
3:48:32	3:48:43	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
3:48:43	3:48:48	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
3:48:48	3:50:8	g	are IY in like   
3:50:8	3:50:42	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
3:50:42	3:51:40	f	IY m three inches above the savannah
3:51:40	3:52:49	g	no IY have  
3:52:49	3:53:46	g	maybe IY have different things
3:53:46	3:55:14	g	well alright
3:55:14	3:56:40	f	IY know IY have different things so
3:56:40	3:58:32	g	alright alright well just
3:58:32	3:58:54	g	just do it like this ok
3:58:54	4:0:39	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
4:0:39	4:0:45	f	and curve down to the left 
4:0:45	4:2:2	g	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
4:2:2	4:3:19	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
4:3:19	4:5:6	g	it s right next to it
4:5:6	4:5:53	g	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
4:5:53	4:6:49	f	how many inches do IY think 
4:6:49	4:7:7	g	maybe like
4:7:7	4:8:56	g	a quarter of an inch
4:8:56	4:9:24	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
4:9:24	4:10:2	f	oh
4:10:2	4:11:30	f	ok
4:11:30	4:12:26	g	ok
4:12:26	4:13:39	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
4:13:39	4:13:43	g	for like
4:13:43	4:14:44	g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
4:14:44	4:15:27	f	yeah
4:15:27	4:17:23	g	and then IY slope down to the left
4:17:23	4:18:50	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
4:18:50	4:19:42	f	mm hmm
4:19:42	4:20:46	g	ok
4:20:46	4:21:19	g	and then
4:21:19	4:22:4	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
4:22:4	4:23:17	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
4:23:17	4:23:29	g	ok
4:23:29	4:23:54	g	so IY re at the hot springs
4:23:54	4:25:35	g	and IY re sloping to the left
4:25:35	4:27:4	g	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
4:27:4	4:27:34	f	mm hmm
4:27:34	4:29:13	g	ok
4:29:13	4:30:41	g	and then
4:30:41	4:31:38	g	uhm
4:31:38	4:32:45	g	IY slope down again
4:32:45	4:33:28	f	elephants 
4:33:28	4:33:47	g	uhm
4:33:47	4:35:8	g	no there s no elephants
4:35:8	4:35:25	g	on IY sheet anyway
4:35:25	4:36:7	f	ok
4:36:7	4:36:32	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
4:36:32	4:38:0	g	no
4:38:0	4:38:23	g	IY re just going down
4:38:23	4:39:38	g	like IY re sloping
4:39:38	4:39:52	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
4:39:52	4:41:16	g	and is to the left
4:41:16	4:42:14	f	ok
4:42:14	4:43:44	g	ok
4:43:44	4:44:13	g	and then
4:44:13	4:45:24	g	uhm
4:45:24	4:45:33	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
4:45:33	4:46:35	g	to the left
4:46:35	4:46:49	f	ok
4:46:49	4:46:50	g	ok
4:46:50	4:47:26	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
4:47:26	4:48:30	f	to 
4:48:30	4:49:36	g	to the white mountain
4:49:36	4:49:48	f	ok
4:49:48	4:50:41	g	ok 
4:50:41	4:50:45	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
4:50:45	4:51:55	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
4:51:55	4:52:47	g	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
4:52:47	4:53:0	f	ok
4:53:0	4:53:11	g	ok
4:53:11	4:55:5	g	so that s about IY would say
4:55:5	4:56:24	g	that s about five or six inches
4:56:24	4:58:14	f	mm hmm
4:58:14	4:58:29	g	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
4:58:29	4:58:38	f	mm hmm
4:58:38	5:0:37	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
5:0:37	5:1:22	g	and IY just go straight up
5:1:22	5:1:47	g	for about two inches
5:1:47	5:3:6	g	ok
5:3:6	5:3:9	f	yep
5:3:9	5:3:22	g	then
5:3:22	5:3:40	f	IY hit some round rocks
5:3:40	5:3:48	g	no IY don t have any rocks
5:3:48	5:5:8	f	ok
5:5:8	5:6:14	g	ok
5:6:14	5:7:50	f	IY hit some rocks though
5:7:50	5:9:0	g	ok
5:9:0	5:10:4	g	uhm
5:10:4	5:10:56	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
5:10:56	5:11:48	g	and then IY slope
5:11:48	5:11:48	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
5:11:48	5:13:1	f	IY go to a lake 
5:13:1	5:14:21	g	yes IY re going towards the lake
5:14:21	5:15:47	f	ok
5:15:47	5:16:24	g	but
5:16:24	5:16:31	g	IY re going about
5:16:31	5:17:18	g	three inches straight across
5:17:18	5:19:14	g	to the lake 
5:19:14	5:21:7	g	and then IY are
5:21:7	5:21:13	g	IY got that 
5:21:13	5:22:52	f	do IY go through anything 
5:22:52	5:24:35	g	uhm
5:24:35	5:26:26	g	no
5:26:26	5:26:53	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
5:26:53	5:28:36	g	so IY go three inches straight
5:28:36	5:28:43	g	and then IY slope up
5:28:43	5:30:22	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
5:30:22	5:31:37	f	around the lake to the top 
5:31:37	5:31:54	g	the  
5:31:54	5:33:28	g	what 
5:33:28	5:35:25	f	around the top of the lake 
5:35:25	5:36:54	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
5:36:54	5:38:18	f	ok
5:38:18	5:39:5	g	ok
5:39:5	5:40:44	g	and then
5:40:44	5:41:6	g	uhm
5:41:6	5:42:15	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
5:42:15	5:43:1	g	do IY have roman baths 
5:43:1	5:43:18	f	nope
5:43:18	5:43:58	g	ok well
5:43:58	5:45:30	g	they re there
5:45:30	5:47:27	g	so anyway
5:47:27	5:49:17	g	IY make
5:49:17	5:49:47	f	IY ve a plane crash though
5:49:47	5:50:32	g	what 
5:50:32	5:51:1	f	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
5:51:1	5:51:5	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
5:51:5	5:52:31	g	so IY make that circle
5:52:31	5:52:47	f	ok
5:52:47	5:53:17	f	yeah
5:53:17	5:53:21	g	and 
5:53:21	5:54:5	g	after the circle
5:54:5	5:54:46	g	uhm
5:54:46	5:56:17	g	IY move to the left
5:56:17	5:57:55	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
5:57:55	5:59:52	f	ok
5:59:52	6:1:34	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
6:1:34	6:2:30	g	like three inches 
6:2:30	6:3:28	g	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
6:3:28	6:5:16	f	yeah
6:5:16	6:6:11	g	ok
6:6:11	6:6:25	g	IY go straight down
