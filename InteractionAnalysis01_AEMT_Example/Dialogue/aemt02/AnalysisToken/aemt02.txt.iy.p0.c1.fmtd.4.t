8	0:9:43	0:9:49	no IY don t have any rocks
9	0:10:19	0:10:25	ok
13	0:12:54	0:13:0	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
14	0:14:42	0:14:49	and IY should have a straight line there
15	0:14:50	0:14:51	well alright
16	0:16:49	0:16:49	ok
17	0:17:23	0:17:29	like maybe an inch
18	0:17:55	0:17:57	and then IY go straight
20	0:20:3	0:20:4	and then
21	0:20:5	0:20:10	no IY have

26	0:22:56	0:23:2	uhm
27	0:23:38	0:23:43	and then IY slope up
29	0:26:59	0:27:1	uhm
30	0:27:8	0:27:14	and 
31	0:28:3	0:28:4	the  
32	0:28:9	0:28:12	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
33	0:30:25	0:30:33	alright alright well just
34	0:31:24	0:31:33	where IY re going down to a plane crash
36	0:33:21	0:33:29	no IY don t have a waterhole
37	0:33:38	0:33:40	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
38	0:33:43	0:33:44	three inches straight across
40	0:39:46	0:39:49	IY re actually starting like right
42	0:42:1	0:42:7	uh like
43	0:46:0	0:46:8	uhm
44	0:47:6	0:47:7	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
46	0:48:40	0:48:49	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
47	0:54:39	0:54:42	IY re sloping
50	0:58:28	0:58:32	uhhh no
51	0:58:51	0:58:59	IY re kind of going  
52	0:59:19	0:59:19	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
53	1:0:3	1:0:3	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
54	1:2:28	1:2:29	IY re at the plane crash
57	1:3:55	1:3:59	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
58	1:5:36	1:5:43	and 
60	1:7:17	1:7:25	yes IY re going towards the lake
62	1:8:21	1:8:26	maybe like
64	1:10:59	1:11:0	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
67	1:13:3	1:13:3	ok
69	1:14:32	1:14:33	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
71	1:16:16	1:16:16	just a slight slope
74	1:16:57	1:17:4	ok and then IY re going
75	1:17:39	1:17:48	IY re starting at the stony desert
76	1:17:53	1:17:58	and then
77	1:20:37	1:20:43	and then
78	1:21:31	1:21:31	ok
79	1:22:19	1:22:24	are IY  
81	1:24:2	1:24:11	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
82	1:25:12	1:25:12	after the circle
83	1:27:34	1:27:40	uhm
84	1:28:36	1:28:40	ok
85	1:28:44	1:28:51	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
86	1:29:13	1:29:14	and then
87	1:31:22	1:31:22	IY slope down again
89	1:34:32	1:34:35	IY don t know
90	1:35:16	1:35:24	but
91	1:35:40	1:35:48	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
92	1:35:56	1:36:2	uhm
93	1:36:54	1:37:2	ok
97	1:40:43	1:40:51	uhm
99	1:43:20	1:43:27	so
100	1:44:28	1:44:28	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
103	1:50:46	1:50:53	and IY just go straight up
104	1:50:52	1:50:56	like IY re sloping
105	1:51:16	1:51:23	like four or five inches to the left
106	1:53:33	1:53:41	are IY in like almost the top of the
108	1:54:41	1:54:49	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
110	1:58:4	1:58:9	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
111	1:58:9	1:58:14	a quarter of an inch
112	1:58:57	1:59:1	after that IY go straight again
113	2:0:10	2:0:14	for about two inches
115	2:1:10	2:1:17	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
116	2:1:16	2:1:25	what 
117	2:1:41	2:1:50	have a s 
119	2:2:43	2:2:45	is the plane crash  
120	2:2:50	2:2:50	so anyway
121	2:3:45	2:3:54	and then IY re going down
122	2:4:0	2:4:2	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
125	2:7:32	2:7:33	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
127	2:9:55	2:10:0	after IY slope down IY d say
128	2:10:14	2:10:20	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
129	2:11:52	2:11:56	a little
130	2:14:48	2:14:51	IY wanna kind of curve
131	2:15:21	2:15:29	ok 
132	2:15:42	2:15:44	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
134	2:16:29	2:16:36	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
135	2:16:46	2:16:53	are IY anywhere near there 
136	2:17:54	2:17:56	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
137	2:19:53	2:19:53	uhm
138	2:20:18	2:20:27	IY re starting
140	2:22:47	2:22:52	and then IY ll come to a savannah
141	2:23:24	2:23:28	so IY make that circle
144	2:26:29	2:26:31	five
145	2:28:27	2:28:30	from
146	2:30:9	2:30:9	well
148	2:31:44	2:31:50	well
149	2:31:53	2:32:0	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
150	2:31:58	2:32:4	go up like three  three and a half inches
151	2:33:55	2:33:56	and then
152	2:34:31	2:34:31	like three inches 
153	2:35:39	2:35:45	to the white mountain
154	2:35:49	2:35:57	alright are IY starting  near the  
155	2:36:57	2:37:4	and then IY go
157	2:39:21	2:39:27	an inch maybe a little bit less
158	2:40:16	2:40:21	it s right next to it
159	2:40:13	2:40:22	uhm
160	2:40:34	2:40:34	uhm and there is a stony desert
163	2:43:4	2:43:7	IY just kind of slope down
164	2:43:45	2:43:45	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
165	2:44:37	2:44:38	to the right
166	2:45:53	2:45:53	ok
168	2:50:3	2:50:7	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
169	2:50:30	2:50:38	so that s about IY would say
170	2:52:22	2:52:27	like
172	2:56:8	2:56:17	ok
173	2:56:45	2:56:48	just do it like this ok
175	2:57:37	2:57:37	ok
176	2:57:33	2:57:39	and then IY slope
178	3:0:14	3:0:22	three inches
179	3:1:42	3:1:49	IY got that 
180	3:2:47	3:2:56	ok
181	3:3:25	3:3:27	uhm
182	3:4:27	3:4:34	and that s where the plane crash is
183	3:5:35	3:5:42	and there s a plane crash
185	3:10:6	3:10:6	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
187	3:10:41	3:10:50	uhm
192	3:22:5	3:22:6	ok
194	3:23:23	3:23:25	they re there
195	3:25:14	3:25:17	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
196	3:26:20	3:26:26	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
198	3:27:40	3:27:46	and IY slope is about an inch long
199	3:27:54	3:28:0	ok
200	3:29:45	3:29:52	do IY have roman baths 
201	3:30:12	3:30:14	and it slopes a little bit to the right
202	3:32:40	3:32:48	ok
204	3:37:35	3:37:42	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
205	3:39:31	3:39:32	and then
206	3:39:40	3:39:46	probably the same thing
207	3:43:29	3:43:30	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
210	3:48:41	3:48:46	couple miles or something
211	3:49:51	3:49:51	and then IY  IY go up
212	3:50:17	3:50:23	ok
213	3:50:53	3:51:1	IY move to the left
214	3:55:36	3:55:44	IY would say
215	3:57:35	3:57:38	ok
216	3:57:52	3:58:0	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
218	4:0:17	4:0:21	and IY re going straight up
219	4:1:52	4:1:58	and is to the left
221	4:4:41	4:4:46	ok
222	4:7:2	4:7:8	ok
223	4:8:32	4:8:40	ok
224	4:9:2	4:9:11	like an inch
225	4:13:14	4:13:17	uhm
226	4:13:42	4:13:42	straight up
227	4:14:37	4:14:41	uhm
228	4:15:36	4:15:37	ok
229	4:15:45	4:15:49	alright 
230	4:16:35	4:16:36	ok
233	4:23:30	4:23:30	a little bit too
234	4:25:43	4:25:52	like
237	4:27:45	4:27:49	IY plane crash 
238	4:27:50	4:27:57	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
239	4:29:14	4:29:18	to IY right 
240	4:31:24	4:31:33	so IY go three inches straight
241	4:33:17	4:33:17	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
242	4:36:23	4:36:25	then
243	4:36:37	4:36:40	kind of across from stony desert
244	4:36:55	4:37:1	and then
245	4:37:20	4:37:28	are IY anywere near there 
246	4:38:54	4:39:0	maybe IY have different things
247	4:39:59	4:40:0	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
248	4:40:2	4:40:2	ok IY re at the savannah
249	4:40:34	4:40:38	IY go straight down
251	4:43:16	4:43:20	slight
253	4:45:46	4:45:49	uhm
254	4:46:9	4:46:15	hmm
255	4:46:31	4:46:40	three inches
256	4:48:31	4:48:35	you
257	4:50:32	4:50:32	the slate mountain is towards the right
258	4:50:33	4:50:33	on IY sheet anyway
260	4:52:37	4:52:45	and IY re going
261	4:53:45	4:53:48	ok
262	4:53:54	4:53:55	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
263	4:54:13	4:54:19	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
266	4:55:51	4:55:55	no
267	4:56:42	4:56:42	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
268	4:57:45	4:57:52	well just
269	4:58:43	4:58:45	what 
271	5:3:47	5:3:53	maybe like
272	5:5:6	5:5:9	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
273	5:6:47	5:6:47	for like
274	5:7:27	5:7:31	maybe
276	5:13:14	5:13:22	alright well IY ll keep going and see
277	5:15:49	5:15:58	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
278	5:16:1	5:16:7	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
280	5:19:15	5:19:23	are IY in like   
281	5:21:46	5:21:50	around the bottom of it
282	5:23:29	5:23:32	IY re going about
283	5:24:5	5:24:5	and then IY are
284	5:24:52	5:25:1	and IY re going up like
286	5:28:43	5:28:52	not right at the stony desert
287	5:33:54	5:34:1	to the lake 
288	5:34:44	5:34:49	to the left
289	5:38:56	5:38:57	and
290	5:42:7	5:42:9	and
291	5:43:21	5:43:30	for like

298	5:50:27	5:50:29	ok
301	5:53:56	5:53:57	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
302	5:54:38	5:54:42	it s not a big curve
303	5:54:48	5:54:52	uhm
305	5:57:24	5:57:28	like
306	5:57:31	5:57:34	maybe four inches on the paper
307	5:57:57	5:57:58	and IY go down IY slope to the right
308	5:58:22	5:58:23	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
309	5:59:32	5:59:39	to the left
310	6:0:35	6:0:39	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
311	6:0:43	6:0:44	so IY re at the hot springs
312	6:0:54	6:1:3	that s IY little slope
314	6:4:58	6:5:5	like
315	6:5:0	6:5:9	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
316	6:5:35	6:5:40	after plane crash
317	6:6:1	6:6:9	couple inches IY re sloping down
318	6:6:23	6:6:29	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
320	6:9:23	6:9:29	and IY go to the left a little bit
322	6:10:18	6:10:19	IY re just going down
324	6:11:28	6:11:37	ok well
325	6:12:6	6:12:12	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
326	6:12:33	6:12:40	IY make
328	6:15:48	6:15:56	alright 
329	6:16:15	6:16:16	uhm
330	6:16:32	6:16:35	uhm
333	6:24:52	6:24:52	and then IY slope down to the left
335	6:30:0	6:30:2	yes
337	6:30:22	6:30:26	that s about five or six inches
339	6:31:45	6:31:45	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
340	6:32:19	6:32:19	four or five inches to the left
341	6:36:2	6:36:9	ok IY plane crash isn t there
342	6:36:5	6:36:14	ok well
start f
2	0:1:56	0:2:5	around the lake to the top 
4	0:2:55	0:3:2	ok
5	0:4:57	0:4:57	how many inches do IY think 
10	0:11:23	0:11:24	so IY go to the left of the antelope
11	0:11:46	0:11:53	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
12	0:12:7	0:12:14	yeah 
19	0:17:57	0:17:57	ok
23	0:20:26	0:20:34	and curve down to the left 
28	0:25:8	0:25:11	ok
35	0:33:14	0:33:23	 IY m at the savannah
39	0:37:17	0:37:22	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
41	0:39:49	0:39:58	yeah
45	0:48:4	0:48:12	yeah
48	0:55:14	0:55:18	mm hmm
49	0:58:1	0:58:8	do IY go by the plane crash 
55	1:2:42	1:2:48	and there s a collapsed shelter
56	1:3:33	1:3:34	IY ve a plane crash though
59	1:7:20	1:7:22	ok
61	1:8:13	1:8:17	to 
63	1:9:14	1:9:23	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
65	1:11:23	1:11:32	around the top of the lake 
66	1:12:5	1:12:11	to the left
68	1:13:23	1:13:26	and to the right 
70	1:14:56	1:15:1	uh IY don t know know what to say

109	1:56:2	1:56:3	and then what 
114	2:0:39	2:0:40	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
118	2:2:31	2:2:33	ok
123	2:3:59	2:4:8	IY go to a lake 
124	2:4:16	2:4:16	ok
126	2:8:39	2:8:43	ok
133	2:15:40	2:15:46	up diagonally to the right of the antelope

162	2:42:45	2:42:45	ok
167	2:50:0	2:50:2	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
171	2:54:10	2:54:15	ok
174	2:57:27	2:57:29	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
177	2:59:38	2:59:47	ok
184	3:6:24	3:6:33	uhm my
186	3:10:41	3:10:43	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
188	3:10:50	3:10:52	nope IY have a white mountain
189	3:11:46	3:11:51	ok
190	3:19:7	3:19:7	to the left of the antelope
191	3:20:3	3:20:11	ok

197	3:26:26	3:26:28	ok
203	3:34:38	3:34:41	IY know IY have different things so
208	3:44:49	3:44:49	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
209	3:45:10	3:45:18	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
217	3:58:16	3:58:18	ok
220	4:2:36	4:2:40	ok
231	4:20:58	4:21:2	yeah IY see that

259	4:50:45	4:50:51	ok wait hold on
264	4:54:23	4:54:29	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
265	4:54:43	4:54:47	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
270	5:2:49	5:2:53	ok
275	5:10:42	5:10:50	ok
279	5:18:32	5:18:37	do IY go through anything 
285	5:25:14	5:25:18	yep
296	5:49:15	5:49:21	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
297	5:49:46	5:49:46	ok
299	5:51:6	5:51:8	so wait
300	5:53:27	5:53:28	yeah and IY went straight up

331	6:20:16	6:20:17	mm  mm
332	6:21:49	6:21:58	IY m three inches above the savannah
334	6:25:26	6:25:31	ok
336	6:29:56	6:30:4	elephants 
338	6:30:59	6:31:4	IY hit some rocks though

9	0:10:19	0:10:25	ok
13	0:12:54	0:13:0	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
14	0:14:42	0:14:49	and IY should have a straight line there
15	0:14:50	0:14:51	well alright
16	0:16:49	0:16:49	ok
17	0:17:23	0:17:29	like maybe an inch

30	0:27:8	0:27:14	and 
31	0:28:3	0:28:4	the  
32	0:28:9	0:28:12	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
33	0:30:25	0:30:33	alright alright well just
34	0:31:24	0:31:33	where IY re going down to a plane crash
36	0:33:21	0:33:29	no IY don t have a waterhole
37	0:33:38	0:33:40	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
38	0:33:43	0:33:44	three inches straight across
40	0:39:46	0:39:49	IY re actually starting like right
42	0:42:1	0:42:7	uh like
43	0:46:0	0:46:8	uhm
44	0:47:6	0:47:7	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
46	0:48:40	0:48:49	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
47	0:54:39	0:54:42	IY re sloping
50	0:58:28	0:58:32	uhhh no
51	0:58:51	0:58:59	IY re kind of going  
52	0:59:19	0:59:19	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
53	1:0:3	1:0:3	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
54	1:2:28	1:2:29	IY re at the plane crash
57	1:3:55	1:3:59	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
58	1:5:36	1:5:43	and 
60	1:7:17	1:7:25	yes IY re going towards the lake
62	1:8:21	1:8:26	maybe like
64	1:10:59	1:11:0	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
67	1:13:3	1:13:3	ok
69	1:14:32	1:14:33	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
71	1:16:16	1:16:16	just a slight slope
74	1:16:57	1:17:4	ok and then IY re going
75	1:17:39	1:17:48	IY re starting at the stony desert
76	1:17:53	1:17:58	and then
77	1:20:37	1:20:43	and then
78	1:21:31	1:21:31	ok
79	1:22:19	1:22:24	are IY  
81	1:24:2	1:24:11	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
82	1:25:12	1:25:12	after the circle
83	1:27:34	1:27:40	uhm
84	1:28:36	1:28:40	ok
85	1:28:44	1:28:51	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
86	1:29:13	1:29:14	and then
87	1:31:22	1:31:22	IY slope down again
89	1:34:32	1:34:35	IY don t know
90	1:35:16	1:35:24	but
91	1:35:40	1:35:48	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
92	1:35:56	1:36:2	uhm
93	1:36:54	1:37:2	ok
97	1:40:43	1:40:51	uhm
99	1:43:20	1:43:27	so
100	1:44:28	1:44:28	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
103	1:50:46	1:50:53	and IY just go straight up
104	1:50:52	1:50:56	like IY re sloping
105	1:51:16	1:51:23	like four or five inches to the left
106	1:53:33	1:53:41	are IY in like almost the top of the
108	1:54:41	1:54:49	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
110	1:58:4	1:58:9	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
111	1:58:9	1:58:14	a quarter of an inch
112	1:58:57	1:59:1	after that IY go straight again
113	2:0:10	2:0:14	for about two inches
115	2:1:10	2:1:17	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
116	2:1:16	2:1:25	what 
117	2:1:41	2:1:50	have a s 
119	2:2:43	2:2:45	is the plane crash  
120	2:2:50	2:2:50	so anyway
121	2:3:45	2:3:54	and then IY re going down
122	2:4:0	2:4:2	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
125	2:7:32	2:7:33	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
127	2:9:55	2:10:0	after IY slope down IY d say
128	2:10:14	2:10:20	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
129	2:11:52	2:11:56	a little
130	2:14:48	2:14:51	IY wanna kind of curve
131	2:15:21	2:15:29	ok 
132	2:15:42	2:15:44	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
134	2:16:29	2:16:36	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
135	2:16:46	2:16:53	are IY anywhere near there 
136	2:17:54	2:17:56	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
137	2:19:53	2:19:53	uhm
138	2:20:18	2:20:27	IY re starting
140	2:22:47	2:22:52	and then IY ll come to a savannah
141	2:23:24	2:23:28	so IY make that circle
144	2:26:29	2:26:31	five
145	2:28:27	2:28:30	from
146	2:30:9	2:30:9	well
148	2:31:44	2:31:50	well
149	2:31:53	2:32:0	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
150	2:31:58	2:32:4	go up like three  three and a half inches
151	2:33:55	2:33:56	and then
152	2:34:31	2:34:31	like three inches 
153	2:35:39	2:35:45	to the white mountain
154	2:35:49	2:35:57	alright are IY starting  near the  
155	2:36:57	2:37:4	and then IY go
157	2:39:21	2:39:27	an inch maybe a little bit less
158	2:40:16	2:40:21	it s right next to it
159	2:40:13	2:40:22	uhm
160	2:40:34	2:40:34	uhm and there is a stony desert
163	2:43:4	2:43:7	IY just kind of slope down
164	2:43:45	2:43:45	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
165	2:44:37	2:44:38	to the right
166	2:45:53	2:45:53	ok
168	2:50:3	2:50:7	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
169	2:50:30	2:50:38	so that s about IY would say
170	2:52:22	2:52:27	like
172	2:56:8	2:56:17	ok
173	2:56:45	2:56:48	just do it like this ok
175	2:57:37	2:57:37	ok
176	2:57:33	2:57:39	and then IY slope
178	3:0:14	3:0:22	three inches
179	3:1:42	3:1:49	IY got that 
180	3:2:47	3:2:56	ok
181	3:3:25	3:3:27	uhm
182	3:4:27	3:4:34	and that s where the plane crash is
183	3:5:35	3:5:42	and there s a plane crash
185	3:10:6	3:10:6	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
187	3:10:41	3:10:50	uhm
192	3:22:5	3:22:6	ok
194	3:23:23	3:23:25	they re there
195	3:25:14	3:25:17	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
196	3:26:20	3:26:26	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
198	3:27:40	3:27:46	and IY slope is about an inch long
199	3:27:54	3:28:0	ok
200	3:29:45	3:29:52	do IY have roman baths 
201	3:30:12	3:30:14	and it slopes a little bit to the right
202	3:32:40	3:32:48	ok
204	3:37:35	3:37:42	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
205	3:39:31	3:39:32	and then
206	3:39:40	3:39:46	probably the same thing
207	3:43:29	3:43:30	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
210	3:48:41	3:48:46	couple miles or something
211	3:49:51	3:49:51	and then IY  IY go up
212	3:50:17	3:50:23	ok
213	3:50:53	3:51:1	IY move to the left
214	3:55:36	3:55:44	IY would say
215	3:57:35	3:57:38	ok
216	3:57:52	3:58:0	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
218	4:0:17	4:0:21	and IY re going straight up
219	4:1:52	4:1:58	and is to the left
221	4:4:41	4:4:46	ok
222	4:7:2	4:7:8	ok
223	4:8:32	4:8:40	ok
224	4:9:2	4:9:11	like an inch
225	4:13:14	4:13:17	uhm
226	4:13:42	4:13:42	straight up
227	4:14:37	4:14:41	uhm
228	4:15:36	4:15:37	ok
229	4:15:45	4:15:49	alright 
230	4:16:35	4:16:36	ok
233	4:23:30	4:23:30	a little bit too
234	4:25:43	4:25:52	like
237	4:27:45	4:27:49	IY plane crash 
238	4:27:50	4:27:57	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
239	4:29:14	4:29:18	to IY right 
240	4:31:24	4:31:33	so IY go three inches straight
241	4:33:17	4:33:17	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
242	4:36:23	4:36:25	then
243	4:36:37	4:36:40	kind of across from stony desert
244	4:36:55	4:37:1	and then
245	4:37:20	4:37:28	are IY anywere near there 
246	4:38:54	4:39:0	maybe IY have different things
247	4:39:59	4:40:0	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
248	4:40:2	4:40:2	ok IY re at the savannah
249	4:40:34	4:40:38	IY go straight down
251	4:43:16	4:43:20	slight
253	4:45:46	4:45:49	uhm
254	4:46:9	4:46:15	hmm
255	4:46:31	4:46:40	three inches
256	4:48:31	4:48:35	you
257	4:50:32	4:50:32	the slate mountain is towards the right
258	4:50:33	4:50:33	on IY sheet anyway
260	4:52:37	4:52:45	and IY re going
261	4:53:45	4:53:48	ok
262	4:53:54	4:53:55	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
263	4:54:13	4:54:19	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
266	4:55:51	4:55:55	no
267	4:56:42	4:56:42	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
268	4:57:45	4:57:52	well just
269	4:58:43	4:58:45	what 
271	5:3:47	5:3:53	maybe like
272	5:5:6	5:5:9	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
273	5:6:47	5:6:47	for like
274	5:7:27	5:7:31	maybe
276	5:13:14	5:13:22	alright well IY ll keep going and see
277	5:15:49	5:15:58	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
278	5:16:1	5:16:7	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
280	5:19:15	5:19:23	are IY in like   
281	5:21:46	5:21:50	around the bottom of it
282	5:23:29	5:23:32	IY re going about
283	5:24:5	5:24:5	and then IY are
284	5:24:52	5:25:1	and IY re going up like
286	5:28:43	5:28:52	not right at the stony desert
287	5:33:54	5:34:1	to the lake 
288	5:34:44	5:34:49	to the left
289	5:38:56	5:38:57	and
290	5:42:7	5:42:9	and
291	5:43:21	5:43:30	for like
292	5:43:25	5:43:31	there s a there s  
293	5:46:18	5:46:25	uhm
294	5:47:59	5:48:5	and then
295	5:48:15	5:48:22	yes
298	5:50:27	5:50:29	ok
301	5:53:56	5:53:57	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
302	5:54:38	5:54:42	it s not a big curve
303	5:54:48	5:54:52	uhm
305	5:57:24	5:57:28	like
306	5:57:31	5:57:34	maybe four inches on the paper
307	5:57:57	5:57:58	and IY go down IY slope to the right
308	5:58:22	5:58:23	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
309	5:59:32	5:59:39	to the left
310	6:0:35	6:0:39	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
311	6:0:43	6:0:44	so IY re at the hot springs
312	6:0:54	6:1:3	that s IY little slope
314	6:4:58	6:5:5	like
315	6:5:0	6:5:9	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
316	6:5:35	6:5:40	after plane crash
317	6:6:1	6:6:9	couple inches IY re sloping down
318	6:6:23	6:6:29	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
320	6:9:23	6:9:29	and IY go to the left a little bit
322	6:10:18	6:10:19	IY re just going down
324	6:11:28	6:11:37	ok well
