start
start g
0	0:0:22	0:0:22	ok IY plane crash isn t there
1	0:1:47	0:1:55	that s about five or six inches
2	0:3:4	0:3:10	so IY re at the hot springs
3	0:3:10	0:3:17	well
4	0:4:29	0:4:30	like three inches 
5	0:6:40	0:6:47	so IY make that circle
6	0:7:21	0:7:28	and then
7	0:9:10	0:9:13	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
9	0:9:45	0:9:45	yes
10	0:11:23	0:11:25	where IY re going down to a plane crash
11	0:12:39	0:12:44	probably the same thing
12	0:14:56	0:15:1	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
13	0:15:18	0:15:21	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
14	0:18:42	0:18:51	uhm
16	0:21:30	0:21:39	ok
17	0:24:13	0:24:15	ok 
18	0:24:18	0:24:19	maybe
19	0:24:47	0:24:50	ok
21	0:27:17	0:27:17	and then
22	0:30:2	0:30:11	no
23	0:32:14	0:32:16	ok
24	0:32:17	0:32:17	are IY  
25	0:33:24	0:33:26	uhm
29	0:37:43	0:37:43	so IY go three inches straight
30	0:39:29	0:39:30	uhm
31	0:40:29	0:40:30	ok
32	0:42:49	0:42:58	IY plane crash 
33	0:44:27	0:44:32	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
34	0:44:45	0:44:50	uhm
35	0:45:9	0:45:18	alright are IY starting  near the  
36	0:46:40	0:46:44	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
37	0:47:53	0:47:57	and then IY slope
38	0:48:44	0:48:44	and
39	0:49:20	0:49:25	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
40	0:50:20	0:50:28	IY wanna kind of curve
41	0:51:9	0:51:9	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
42	0:51:36	0:51:41	IY re starting
43	0:51:53	0:52:0	ok
45	0:53:13	0:53:18	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
48	0:58:35	0:58:38	about like
51	1:4:40	1:4:46	the  
52	1:5:52	1:5:56	after that IY go straight again
53	1:6:55	1:6:56	a little
54	1:8:30	1:8:34	to IY right 
55	1:8:32	1:8:37	no IY have  
56	1:9:1	1:9:3	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
57	1:10:2	1:10:5	five
59	1:11:3	1:11:10	well just
60	1:11:59	1:12:0	and IY go down IY slope to the right
62	1:12:15	1:12:20	on IY sheet anyway
63	1:12:38	1:12:38	IY don t know
64	1:14:1	1:14:8	ok
66	1:14:45	1:14:51	are IY in like   
67	1:15:6	1:15:6	have a s 
69	1:18:19	1:18:25	and then IY go
71	1:20:52	1:20:52	around the bottom of it
73	1:22:19	1:22:22	IY re just going down
74	1:22:32	1:22:37	ok
77	1:25:44	1:25:48	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
78	1:26:21	1:26:29	ok
79	1:26:58	1:27:5	are IY anywere near there 
80	1:27:32	1:27:35	uhm
81	1:30:25	1:30:31	ok
83	1:32:15	1:32:15	a little bit too
84	1:32:14	1:32:22	and then IY ll come to a savannah
86	1:34:12	1:34:12	that s IY little slope
87	1:34:12	1:34:15	couple miles or something
88	1:34:33	1:34:41	like four or five inches to the left
89	1:35:17	1:35:21	like
91	1:38:46	1:38:48	IY re going like
92	1:39:46	1:39:55	ok
93	1:41:20	1:41:22	after the circle
94	1:42:28	1:42:32	and then
95	1:42:55	1:42:58	like an inch
96	1:43:39	1:43:45	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
99	1:48:31	1:48:31	uh like
103	1:49:23	1:49:30	is the plane crash  
104	1:51:5	1:51:13	straight up
106	1:54:7	1:54:12	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
108	1:56:29	1:56:32	and IY slope is about an inch long
109	1:59:19	1:59:28	ok
110	1:59:51	1:59:55	just a slight slope
113	2:11:2	2:11:11	the slate mountain is towards the right
114	2:11:42	2:11:42	and IY re going straight up
115	2:11:56	2:12:3	and then IY go straight
117	2:12:28	2:12:37	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
118	2:13:16	2:13:18	maybe four inches on the paper
119	2:15:1	2:15:10	and then
120	2:17:56	2:17:59	just do it like this ok
121	2:18:28	2:18:35	ok
123	2:20:12	2:20:21	and IY re going
126	2:21:17	2:21:17	IY got that 
128	2:22:31	2:22:35	and IY re sloping to the left
129	2:24:48	2:24:52	so that s about IY would say
132	2:31:32	2:31:33	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
133	2:31:45	2:31:46	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
137	2:36:10	2:36:18	and then IY slope down to the left
138	2:39:26	2:39:28	IY re going about
139	2:39:23	2:39:31	and 
140	2:41:56	2:42:2	ok IY re at the savannah
141	2:46:5	2:46:10	like
143	2:51:10	2:51:11	are IY anywhere near there 
145	2:53:49	2:53:52	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
146	2:53:52	2:53:54	and 
148	2:55:58	2:56:2	and that s where the plane crash is
151	2:58:53	2:58:55	uhm
152	3:2:57	3:2:57	you
154	3:3:2	3:3:6	ok
157	3:5:6	3:5:12	uhm
158	3:5:11	3:5:20	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
159	3:5:51	3:5:57	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
160	3:6:48	3:6:49	maybe like
161	3:9:30	3:9:37	so
162	3:12:25	3:12:28	and then IY re going down
163	3:13:8	3:13:14	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
164	3:14:22	3:14:26	a quarter of an inch
165	3:14:45	3:14:47	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
166	3:14:48	3:14:55	and
168	3:22:9	3:22:18	to the lake 
169	3:22:34	3:22:38	uhm and there is a stony desert
170	3:23:7	3:23:9	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
171	3:23:10	3:23:14	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
172	3:24:20	3:24:22	what 
173	3:27:49	3:27:50	maybe like
174	3:28:35	3:28:38	and is to the left
175	3:28:35	3:28:41	to the right
176	3:33:40	3:33:48	hmm
178	3:34:49	3:34:55	what 
179	3:34:54	3:35:2	ok
180	3:35:1	3:35:9	but
181	3:35:40	3:35:46	ok well
183	3:40:26	3:40:26	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
184	3:43:42	3:43:48	for about two inches
185	3:44:10	3:44:10	and then
186	3:48:47	3:48:56	to the left
190	3:51:6	3:51:13	then
191	3:51:44	3:51:46	uhm
192	3:52:5	3:52:11	after IY slope down IY d say
193	3:54:0	3:54:3	uhhh no
194	3:56:47	3:56:53	ok well
195	3:58:4	3:58:7	no IY don t have a waterhole
197	3:59:10	3:59:11	four or five inches to the left
199	4:4:12	4:4:14	yes IY re going towards the lake
200	4:5:44	4:5:53	ok
202	4:9:29	4:9:35	an inch maybe a little bit less
204	4:11:21	4:11:23	and then
206	4:11:31	4:11:35	alright 
207	4:13:29	4:13:37	alright alright well just
208	4:13:51	4:13:51	uhm
209	4:15:23	4:15:31	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
210	4:15:40	4:15:46	maybe IY have different things
211	4:18:44	4:18:48	IY go straight down
213	4:22:20	4:22:28	well
214	4:23:26	4:23:33	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
215	4:23:51	4:23:52	uhm
218	4:30:59	4:31:8	alright well IY ll keep going and see
219	4:31:30	4:31:37	they re there
220	4:31:46	4:31:47	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
221	4:32:14	4:32:23	IY would say
222	4:32:30	4:32:35	ok and then IY re going
223	4:32:53	4:32:53	IY move to the left
224	4:33:19	4:33:24	and IY just go straight up
227	4:35:33	4:35:37	kind of across from stony desert
228	4:36:23	4:36:26	IY re at the plane crash
230	4:37:2	4:37:6	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
231	4:38:11	4:38:20	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
232	4:39:44	4:39:46	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
233	4:40:4	4:40:7	to the left
235	4:41:35	4:41:36	no there s no elephants
237	4:42:59	4:43:6	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
238	4:43:31	4:43:39	so anyway
239	4:43:41	4:43:47	uhm
240	4:48:56	4:49:3	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
241	4:49:9	4:49:17	and IY should have a straight line there
242	4:49:16	4:49:22	after plane crash
243	4:49:50	4:49:57	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
244	4:51:37	4:51:42	couple inches IY re sloping down
246	4:54:4	4:54:4	for like
247	4:54:5	4:54:10	ok
248	4:55:21	4:55:25	three inches straight across
249	4:55:57	4:56:6	and IY go to the left a little bit
251	4:57:57	4:58:3	ok
253	4:59:53	5:0:0	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
254	5:0:8	5:0:9	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
255	5:0:59	5:1:8	alright 
257	5:3:25	5:3:32	to the left
258	5:4:38	5:4:41	ok
260	5:7:16	5:7:17	IY re starting at the stony desert
261	5:7:51	5:7:54	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
262	5:7:54	5:7:57	ok
263	5:8:27	5:8:29	yes
266	5:11:25	5:11:29	IY make
267	5:12:42	5:12:46	uhm

272	5:15:31	5:15:36	there s a there s  
274	5:18:1	5:18:5	and IY re going up like
275	5:18:50	5:18:58	IY slope down again
276	5:19:3	5:19:7	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
277	5:21:30	5:21:34	three inches
278	5:22:27	5:22:33	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
279	5:22:29	5:22:35	from
280	5:23:30	5:23:33	uhm
281	5:23:45	5:23:53	ok
282	5:25:59	5:26:8	for like
283	5:26:38	5:26:47	IY re sloping
285	5:29:27	5:29:33	IY just kind of slope down
286	5:31:19	5:31:20	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
289	5:32:13	5:32:14	it s not a big curve
290	5:32:40	5:32:42	like IY re sloping
292	5:34:8	5:34:16	and there s a plane crash
294	5:36:42	5:36:48	and then
295	5:37:36	5:37:45	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
296	5:40:30	5:40:39	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
297	5:41:33	5:41:41	well alright
298	5:42:8	5:42:17	like maybe an inch
300	5:42:55	5:42:59	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
301	5:43:0	5:43:5	like
302	5:45:2	5:45:4	no
304	5:58:46	5:58:49	do IY have roman baths 
306	6:0:45	6:0:54	to the white mountain
307	6:1:1	6:1:5	go up like three  three and a half inches
308	6:2:23	6:2:27	and then IY are
309	6:5:27	6:5:33	it s right next to it
310	6:6:22	6:6:22	and then IY  IY go up
313	6:8:37	6:8:44	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
314	6:8:41	6:8:44	slight
315	6:10:11	6:10:15	ok
316	6:10:18	6:10:18	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
317	6:10:19	6:10:19	and then IY slope up
318	6:10:32	6:10:36	uhm
320	6:17:10	6:17:15	ok
321	6:17:35	6:17:44	not right at the stony desert

323	6:19:23	6:19:27	ok
325	6:19:58	6:20:5	and then
327	6:20:47	6:20:52	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
328	6:21:37	6:21:42	and it slopes a little bit to the right
329	6:21:37	6:21:44	IY re actually starting like right
330	6:22:33	6:22:33	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
332	6:23:43	6:23:51	are IY in like almost the top of the
333	6:24:31	6:24:39	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
335	6:25:44	6:25:47	uhm
336	6:26:14	6:26:15	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
337	6:26:21	6:26:21	uhm
338	6:27:54	6:27:56	three inches
340	6:28:20	6:28:27	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
342	6:29:8	6:29:13	like
start f
8	0:9:32	0:9:41	yeah
15	0:18:56	0:18:58	mm hmm

105	1:52:1	1:52:4	yeah and IY went straight up
107	1:54:52	1:54:53	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
111	2:7:19	2:7:22	do IY go around it 
112	2:8:47	2:8:50	ok

150	2:58:26	2:58:33	ok
153	3:3:0	3:3:1	ok
155	3:3:41	3:3:46	to 
156	3:4:23	3:4:31	IY ve a plane crash though
167	3:15:38	3:15:38	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
177	3:33:48	3:33:57	ok
182	3:38:10	3:38:14	IY hit some rocks though
187	3:48:52	3:48:57	IY have to back up a little bit
188	3:50:40	3:50:40	yeah
189	3:51:11	3:51:12	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
196	3:58:44	3:58:52	how many inches do IY think 
198	3:59:38	3:59:47	mm hmm
201	4:9:16	4:9:19	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
203	4:10:29	4:10:29	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
205	4:11:16	4:11:24	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
212	4:21:21	4:21:24	yeah 
216	4:23:49	4:23:55	and to the right 
217	4:26:57	4:27:3	IY go to a lake 
225	4:33:22	4:33:29	mm hmm
226	4:35:19	4:35:25	do IY go by the plane crash 
229	4:36:44	4:36:46	and then what 
234	4:40:42	4:40:51	ok
236	4:42:56	4:43:1	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
245	4:52:2	4:52:7	mm hmm
250	4:57:21	4:57:26	around the top of the lake 
252	4:58:56	4:58:58	oh
256	5:3:11	5:3:11	to the left
259	5:5:48	5:5:53	 IY m at the savannah
264	5:9:26	5:9:31	yeah 
265	5:10:57	5:10:58	ok
269	5:14:7	5:14:8	IY know IY have different things so
273	5:16:26	5:16:28	ok wait hold on
284	5:28:13	5:28:22	yeah IY see that
287	5:31:19	5:31:24	around the lake to the top 
288	5:31:32	5:31:41	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
291	5:33:24	5:33:25	yep
293	5:36:29	5:36:36	yeah
299	5:42:17	5:42:22	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
303	5:52:40	5:52:45	ok
305	5:59:55	5:59:59	and there s a collapsed shelter
311	6:8:36	6:8:39	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
312	6:8:37	6:8:41	ok
319	6:16:55	6:16:56	so wait
324	6:19:43	6:19:45	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
326	6:20:12	6:20:17	mm hmm
331	6:22:57	6:22:59	ok
334	6:25:10	6:25:15	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
339	6:28:8	6:28:12	ok
341	6:29:0	6:29:7	mm  mm
start g
0	0:0:22	0:0:22	ok IY plane crash isn t there
1	0:1:47	0:1:55	that s about five or six inches
2	0:3:4	0:3:10	so IY re at the hot springs
3	0:3:10	0:3:17	well
4	0:4:29	0:4:30	like three inches 
5	0:6:40	0:6:47	so IY make that circle
6	0:7:21	0:7:28	and then
7	0:9:10	0:9:13	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
9	0:9:45	0:9:45	yes
10	0:11:23	0:11:25	where IY re going down to a plane crash
11	0:12:39	0:12:44	probably the same thing
12	0:14:56	0:15:1	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
13	0:15:18	0:15:21	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
14	0:18:42	0:18:51	uhm
16	0:21:30	0:21:39	ok
17	0:24:13	0:24:15	ok 
18	0:24:18	0:24:19	maybe
19	0:24:47	0:24:50	ok
21	0:27:17	0:27:17	and then

23	0:32:14	0:32:16	ok
24	0:32:17	0:32:17	are IY  
25	0:33:24	0:33:26	uhm
29	0:37:43	0:37:43	so IY go three inches straight
30	0:39:29	0:39:30	uhm
31	0:40:29	0:40:30	ok
32	0:42:49	0:42:58	IY plane crash 
33	0:44:27	0:44:32	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
34	0:44:45	0:44:50	uhm
35	0:45:9	0:45:18	alright are IY starting  near the  
36	0:46:40	0:46:44	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
37	0:47:53	0:47:57	and then IY slope
38	0:48:44	0:48:44	and
39	0:49:20	0:49:25	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
40	0:50:20	0:50:28	IY wanna kind of curve
41	0:51:9	0:51:9	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
42	0:51:36	0:51:41	IY re starting
43	0:51:53	0:52:0	ok
45	0:53:13	0:53:18	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
48	0:58:35	0:58:38	about like
51	1:4:40	1:4:46	the  
52	1:5:52	1:5:56	after that IY go straight again
53	1:6:55	1:6:56	a little
54	1:8:30	1:8:34	to IY right 
55	1:8:32	1:8:37	no IY have  
56	1:9:1	1:9:3	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
57	1:10:2	1:10:5	five
59	1:11:3	1:11:10	well just
60	1:11:59	1:12:0	and IY go down IY slope to the right
62	1:12:15	1:12:20	on IY sheet anyway
63	1:12:38	1:12:38	IY don t know
64	1:14:1	1:14:8	ok
66	1:14:45	1:14:51	are IY in like   
67	1:15:6	1:15:6	have a s 
69	1:18:19	1:18:25	and then IY go
71	1:20:52	1:20:52	around the bottom of it
73	1:22:19	1:22:22	IY re just going down
74	1:22:32	1:22:37	ok
77	1:25:44	1:25:48	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
78	1:26:21	1:26:29	ok
79	1:26:58	1:27:5	are IY anywere near there 
80	1:27:32	1:27:35	uhm
81	1:30:25	1:30:31	ok
83	1:32:15	1:32:15	a little bit too
84	1:32:14	1:32:22	and then IY ll come to a savannah
86	1:34:12	1:34:12	that s IY little slope
87	1:34:12	1:34:15	couple miles or something
88	1:34:33	1:34:41	like four or five inches to the left
89	1:35:17	1:35:21	like
91	1:38:46	1:38:48	IY re going like
92	1:39:46	1:39:55	ok
93	1:41:20	1:41:22	after the circle
94	1:42:28	1:42:32	and then
95	1:42:55	1:42:58	like an inch
96	1:43:39	1:43:45	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
99	1:48:31	1:48:31	uh like
103	1:49:23	1:49:30	is the plane crash  
104	1:51:5	1:51:13	straight up
106	1:54:7	1:54:12	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
108	1:56:29	1:56:32	and IY slope is about an inch long
109	1:59:19	1:59:28	ok
110	1:59:51	1:59:55	just a slight slope
113	2:11:2	2:11:11	the slate mountain is towards the right
114	2:11:42	2:11:42	and IY re going straight up
115	2:11:56	2:12:3	and then IY go straight
117	2:12:28	2:12:37	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
118	2:13:16	2:13:18	maybe four inches on the paper
119	2:15:1	2:15:10	and then
120	2:17:56	2:17:59	just do it like this ok
121	2:18:28	2:18:35	ok
123	2:20:12	2:20:21	and IY re going
126	2:21:17	2:21:17	IY got that 
128	2:22:31	2:22:35	and IY re sloping to the left
129	2:24:48	2:24:52	so that s about IY would say
132	2:31:32	2:31:33	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
133	2:31:45	2:31:46	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
137	2:36:10	2:36:18	and then IY slope down to the left
138	2:39:26	2:39:28	IY re going about
139	2:39:23	2:39:31	and 
140	2:41:56	2:42:2	ok IY re at the savannah
141	2:46:5	2:46:10	like
143	2:51:10	2:51:11	are IY anywhere near there 
145	2:53:49	2:53:52	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
146	2:53:52	2:53:54	and 
148	2:55:58	2:56:2	and that s where the plane crash is
151	2:58:53	2:58:55	uhm
152	3:2:57	3:2:57	you
154	3:3:2	3:3:6	ok
157	3:5:6	3:5:12	uhm
158	3:5:11	3:5:20	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
159	3:5:51	3:5:57	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
160	3:6:48	3:6:49	maybe like
161	3:9:30	3:9:37	so
162	3:12:25	3:12:28	and then IY re going down
163	3:13:8	3:13:14	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
164	3:14:22	3:14:26	a quarter of an inch
165	3:14:45	3:14:47	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
166	3:14:48	3:14:55	and
168	3:22:9	3:22:18	to the lake 
169	3:22:34	3:22:38	uhm and there is a stony desert
170	3:23:7	3:23:9	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
171	3:23:10	3:23:14	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
172	3:24:20	3:24:22	what 
173	3:27:49	3:27:50	maybe like
174	3:28:35	3:28:38	and is to the left
175	3:28:35	3:28:41	to the right
176	3:33:40	3:33:48	hmm
178	3:34:49	3:34:55	what 
179	3:34:54	3:35:2	ok
180	3:35:1	3:35:9	but
181	3:35:40	3:35:46	ok well
183	3:40:26	3:40:26	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
184	3:43:42	3:43:48	for about two inches
185	3:44:10	3:44:10	and then
186	3:48:47	3:48:56	to the left
190	3:51:6	3:51:13	then
191	3:51:44	3:51:46	uhm
192	3:52:5	3:52:11	after IY slope down IY d say
193	3:54:0	3:54:3	uhhh no
194	3:56:47	3:56:53	ok well
195	3:58:4	3:58:7	no IY don t have a waterhole
197	3:59:10	3:59:11	four or five inches to the left
199	4:4:12	4:4:14	yes IY re going towards the lake
200	4:5:44	4:5:53	ok
202	4:9:29	4:9:35	an inch maybe a little bit less
204	4:11:21	4:11:23	and then
206	4:11:31	4:11:35	alright 
207	4:13:29	4:13:37	alright alright well just
208	4:13:51	4:13:51	uhm
209	4:15:23	4:15:31	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
210	4:15:40	4:15:46	maybe IY have different things
211	4:18:44	4:18:48	IY go straight down
213	4:22:20	4:22:28	well
214	4:23:26	4:23:33	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
215	4:23:51	4:23:52	uhm
218	4:30:59	4:31:8	alright well IY ll keep going and see
219	4:31:30	4:31:37	they re there
220	4:31:46	4:31:47	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
221	4:32:14	4:32:23	IY would say
222	4:32:30	4:32:35	ok and then IY re going
223	4:32:53	4:32:53	IY move to the left
224	4:33:19	4:33:24	and IY just go straight up
227	4:35:33	4:35:37	kind of across from stony desert
228	4:36:23	4:36:26	IY re at the plane crash
230	4:37:2	4:37:6	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
231	4:38:11	4:38:20	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
232	4:39:44	4:39:46	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
233	4:40:4	4:40:7	to the left
235	4:41:35	4:41:36	no there s no elephants
237	4:42:59	4:43:6	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
238	4:43:31	4:43:39	so anyway
239	4:43:41	4:43:47	uhm
240	4:48:56	4:49:3	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
241	4:49:9	4:49:17	and IY should have a straight line there
242	4:49:16	4:49:22	after plane crash
243	4:49:50	4:49:57	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
244	4:51:37	4:51:42	couple inches IY re sloping down
246	4:54:4	4:54:4	for like
247	4:54:5	4:54:10	ok
248	4:55:21	4:55:25	three inches straight across
249	4:55:57	4:56:6	and IY go to the left a little bit
251	4:57:57	4:58:3	ok
253	4:59:53	5:0:0	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
254	5:0:8	5:0:9	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
255	5:0:59	5:1:8	alright 
257	5:3:25	5:3:32	to the left
258	5:4:38	5:4:41	ok
260	5:7:16	5:7:17	IY re starting at the stony desert
261	5:7:51	5:7:54	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
262	5:7:54	5:7:57	ok
263	5:8:27	5:8:29	yes
266	5:11:25	5:11:29	IY make
267	5:12:42	5:12:46	uhm
268	5:13:38	5:13:44	IY re kind of going  
270	5:15:4	5:15:6	ok
271	5:15:22	5:15:26	uhm
272	5:15:31	5:15:36	there s a there s  
274	5:18:1	5:18:5	and IY re going up like
275	5:18:50	5:18:58	IY slope down again
276	5:19:3	5:19:7	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
277	5:21:30	5:21:34	three inches
278	5:22:27	5:22:33	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
279	5:22:29	5:22:35	from
280	5:23:30	5:23:33	uhm
281	5:23:45	5:23:53	ok
282	5:25:59	5:26:8	for like
283	5:26:38	5:26:47	IY re sloping
285	5:29:27	5:29:33	IY just kind of slope down
286	5:31:19	5:31:20	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
289	5:32:13	5:32:14	it s not a big curve
290	5:32:40	5:32:42	like IY re sloping
292	5:34:8	5:34:16	and there s a plane crash
294	5:36:42	5:36:48	and then
295	5:37:36	5:37:45	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
296	5:40:30	5:40:39	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
297	5:41:33	5:41:41	well alright
298	5:42:8	5:42:17	like maybe an inch
300	5:42:55	5:42:59	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
301	5:43:0	5:43:5	like
302	5:45:2	5:45:4	no
304	5:58:46	5:58:49	do IY have roman baths 
306	6:0:45	6:0:54	to the white mountain
307	6:1:1	6:1:5	go up like three  three and a half inches
308	6:2:23	6:2:27	and then IY are
309	6:5:27	6:5:33	it s right next to it
310	6:6:22	6:6:22	and then IY  IY go up
313	6:8:37	6:8:44	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
314	6:8:41	6:8:44	slight
315	6:10:11	6:10:15	ok
316	6:10:18	6:10:18	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
317	6:10:19	6:10:19	and then IY slope up
318	6:10:32	6:10:36	uhm
320	6:17:10	6:17:15	ok
321	6:17:35	6:17:44	not right at the stony desert
322	6:18:54	6:19:0	no IY don t have any rocks
323	6:19:23	6:19:27	ok
325	6:19:58	6:20:5	and then
327	6:20:47	6:20:52	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
