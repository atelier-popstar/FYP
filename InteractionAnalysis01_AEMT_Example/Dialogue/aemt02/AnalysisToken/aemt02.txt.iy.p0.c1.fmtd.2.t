start
start g
0	0:2:22	0:2:25	ok
2	0:6:4	0:6:12	and IY slope is about an inch long
3	0:8:0	0:8:1	then
4	0:10:10	0:10:18	have a s 
5	0:11:17	0:11:17	like
6	0:13:41	0:13:42	a little
7	0:15:13	0:15:20	on IY sheet anyway
9	0:17:36	0:17:42	the  
10	0:17:43	0:17:50	well just
11	0:18:36	0:18:40	ok IY plane crash isn t there
13	0:22:42	0:22:46	couple inches IY re sloping down
14	0:23:52	0:23:57	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
15	0:24:19	0:24:20	ok
16	0:24:45	0:24:52	that s about five or six inches
17	0:25:51	0:25:56	maybe like
18	0:27:58	0:28:2	uhm
19	0:28:14	0:28:23	uhm
21	0:31:22	0:31:26	like three inches 
23	0:33:41	0:33:43	and 
24	0:36:11	0:36:14	IY re going about
26	0:37:14	0:37:21	alright 
27	0:38:2	0:38:5	are IY anywere near there 
28	0:38:16	0:38:24	well
30	0:39:15	0:39:17	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
32	0:41:22	0:41:22	and then IY go straight
33	0:45:36	0:45:45	no
34	0:46:15	0:46:20	what 
35	0:48:20	0:48:29	about like
39	0:53:3	0:53:12	IY plane crash 
40	0:58:16	0:58:20	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
41	0:58:15	0:58:21	and then IY slope up
42	0:59:58	1:0:0	IY move to the left
43	1:4:55	1:4:59	IY re at the plane crash
44	1:5:45	1:5:45	IY make
45	1:6:29	1:6:33	yes IY re going towards the lake
46	1:6:44	1:6:53	IY re going like
48	1:10:54	1:11:1	ok
49	1:12:12	1:12:16	yes
50	1:13:48	1:13:49	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
52	1:15:18	1:15:24	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
53	1:16:14	1:16:17	kind of across from stony desert
56	1:16:48	1:16:52	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
58	1:19:51	1:19:58	and IY go to the left a little bit
59	1:20:1	1:20:1	a quarter of an inch
60	1:20:50	1:20:50	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
62	1:24:3	1:24:4	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
63	1:27:14	1:27:14	ok and then IY re going
64	1:30:21	1:30:27	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
65	1:33:42	1:33:46	and then
67	1:35:48	1:35:50	IY slope down again
68	1:35:55	1:36:2	to the lake 
69	1:36:54	1:37:2	and then IY re going down
70	1:37:9	1:37:17	couple miles or something
71	1:38:11	1:38:11	and IY should have a straight line there
72	1:38:12	1:38:17	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
73	1:39:45	1:39:48	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
74	1:42:7	1:42:7	straight up
75	1:42:5	1:42:7	three inches
76	1:43:42	1:43:50	alright alright well just
77	1:46:20	1:46:21	ok
78	1:46:24	1:46:25	for like
79	1:48:21	1:48:22	for like
80	1:48:28	1:48:31	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
82	1:52:20	1:52:26	ok
83	1:52:32	1:52:37	no
85	1:55:40	1:55:48	so IY go three inches straight
88	1:57:7	1:57:14	is the plane crash  
89	2:1:0	2:1:4	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
90	2:1:37	2:1:41	to the left
92	2:4:16	2:4:24	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
93	2:6:30	2:6:34	uh like
94	2:9:16	2:9:23	and that s where the plane crash is
95	2:9:42	2:9:50	IY wanna kind of curve
96	2:12:0	2:12:3	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
98	2:14:20	2:14:26	ok
99	2:14:41	2:14:47	and then IY ll come to a savannah
100	2:14:47	2:14:54	ok
101	2:16:15	2:16:23	it s not a big curve
102	2:16:24	2:16:28	like four or five inches to the left
103	2:16:57	2:17:4	uhm
105	2:17:29	2:17:37	to the white mountain
112	2:24:32	2:24:39	maybe like
113	2:32:38	2:32:46	are IY anywhere near there 
115	2:42:26	2:42:29	around the bottom of it
116	2:43:36	2:43:43	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
118	2:45:54	2:45:55	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
120	2:47:14	2:47:22	alright well IY ll keep going and see
121	2:47:35	2:47:40	what 
122	2:48:1	2:48:8	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
123	2:48:31	2:48:32	and then
124	2:49:1	2:49:4	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
125	2:49:3	2:49:6	and IY re sloping to the left
126	2:51:7	2:51:12	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
128	2:52:3	2:52:7	and
130	2:53:16	2:53:25	ok
131	2:55:3	2:55:10	uhm
132	2:58:12	2:58:18	probably the same thing
133	2:58:33	2:58:40	after plane crash
134	2:58:33	2:58:41	to the right
137	2:58:55	2:59:3	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
139	3:1:7	3:1:11	just do it like this ok
141	3:2:30	3:2:38	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
142	3:3:47	3:3:54	and there s a plane crash
143	3:4:25	3:4:31	no IY have  
144	3:5:26	3:5:33	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
146	3:6:3	3:6:10	are IY in like   
150	3:8:38	3:8:42	an inch maybe a little bit less
151	3:10:16	3:10:18	IY re kind of going  
152	3:10:25	3:10:28	uhhh no
153	3:11:23	3:11:28	uhm
154	3:12:27	3:12:34	IY got that 
155	3:14:16	3:14:23	to the left
156	3:14:25	3:14:28	IY re sloping
161	3:21:11	3:21:14	where IY re going down to a plane crash
162	3:22:37	3:22:46	IY would say
163	3:23:55	3:24:1	well alright
164	3:24:11	3:24:13	uhm
165	3:24:54	3:24:57	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
166	3:24:52	3:24:59	ok well
167	3:25:29	3:25:29	uhm
169	3:26:53	3:26:54	ok IY re at the savannah
171	3:27:55	3:28:1	uhm
172	3:28:30	3:28:30	and 
173	3:29:39	3:29:42	for about two inches
174	3:29:46	3:29:47	so IY re at the hot springs
175	3:30:25	3:30:31	like IY re sloping
176	3:30:39	3:30:45	you
178	3:32:56	3:32:56	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
179	3:34:13	3:34:14	IY go straight down
182	3:36:1	3:36:6	uhm
183	3:36:37	3:36:45	ok well
184	3:37:43	3:37:43	maybe four inches on the paper
185	3:39:25	3:39:28	IY don t know
186	3:41:35	3:41:39	and then
187	3:42:20	3:42:24	like maybe an inch
189	3:43:9	3:43:12	well
190	3:43:23	3:43:29	like
191	3:45:27	3:45:33	IY re starting
194	3:47:28	3:47:34	and IY go down IY slope to the right
195	3:47:47	3:47:47	and IY re going straight up
196	3:48:24	3:48:29	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
197	3:50:29	3:50:32	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
198	3:50:43	3:50:43	that s IY little slope
199	3:51:22	3:51:24	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
200	3:51:43	3:51:45	and then IY slope
201	3:52:34	3:52:38	so
203	3:54:22	3:54:29	uhm
205	4:0:18	4:0:20	five
206	4:3:18	4:3:24	they re there
207	4:3:46	4:3:50	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
208	4:3:51	4:3:51	go up like three  three and a half inches
209	4:5:17	4:5:26	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
210	4:5:27	4:5:29	and IY just go straight up
211	4:5:46	4:5:53	so anyway
213	4:8:26	4:8:35	from
214	4:9:37	4:9:40	ok
218	4:12:8	4:12:15	like
222	4:17:31	4:17:31	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
225	4:20:22	4:20:26	uhm
226	4:21:26	4:21:27	ok
228	4:23:57	4:23:59	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
229	4:26:55	4:27:4	but
230	4:29:0	4:29:7	IY re actually starting like right
231	4:29:43	4:29:51	ok
232	4:30:48	4:30:54	like
234	4:35:13	4:35:16	ok
236	4:36:24	4:36:28	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
237	4:39:38	4:39:47	maybe
238	4:41:55	4:42:1	to the left
240	4:46:21	4:46:30	and then
241	4:47:13	4:47:14	no IY don t have any rocks
242	4:48:8	4:48:9	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
245	4:49:0	4:49:2	ok
246	4:49:6	4:49:12	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
248	4:52:5	4:52:10	uhm
252	4:55:9	4:55:14	yes
253	4:57:55	4:57:59	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
254	5:1:31	5:1:33	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
255	5:2:11	5:2:13	and it slopes a little bit to the right
256	5:2:38	5:2:39	alright 
257	5:2:49	5:2:52	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
258	5:7:44	5:7:46	the slate mountain is towards the right
260	5:9:25	5:9:33	and then
261	5:11:26	5:11:29	to IY right 
262	5:13:14	5:13:18	not right at the stony desert
264	5:16:34	5:16:43	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
265	5:17:53	5:17:59	and then IY go
268	5:21:22	5:21:23	IY just kind of slope down
269	5:22:37	5:22:38	ok
270	5:23:15	5:23:24	ok
271	5:23:21	5:23:26	uhm and there is a stony desert
272	5:23:36	5:23:36	and then IY  IY go up
273	5:24:56	5:25:0	uhm
274	5:25:25	5:25:28	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
275	5:25:35	5:25:38	there s a there s  
276	5:27:21	5:27:23	uhm
277	5:27:38	5:27:40	and IY re going

279	5:29:37	5:29:37	ok
283	5:31:44	5:31:44	and then IY slope down to the left
284	5:35:3	5:35:8	and then IY are
285	5:35:45	5:35:47	after the circle
286	5:35:55	5:35:59	four or five inches to the left
287	5:37:15	5:37:24	no there s no elephants
288	5:37:27	5:37:30	no IY don t have a waterhole
289	5:37:54	5:37:56	uhm
291	5:39:15	5:39:23	and then
292	5:40:34	5:40:34	three inches
293	5:41:12	5:41:15	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
294	5:41:42	5:41:51	are IY  
295	5:41:58	5:42:6	it s right next to it
296	5:42:19	5:42:26	ok
297	5:43:11	5:43:14	alright are IY starting  near the  
298	5:43:25	5:43:26	maybe IY have different things
299	5:43:31	5:43:31	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
300	5:43:35	5:43:42	just a slight slope
301	5:43:58	5:44:0	ok
302	5:44:29	5:44:38	ok
303	5:45:18	5:45:23	after that IY go straight again
304	5:47:27	5:47:35	are IY in like almost the top of the
305	5:48:39	5:48:41	like an inch
307	5:49:21	5:49:26	ok
308	5:49:26	5:49:32	do IY have roman baths 
309	5:52:13	5:52:18	after IY slope down IY d say
310	5:52:29	5:52:34	ok
311	5:52:30	5:52:34	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
313	5:54:22	5:54:27	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
314	5:55:50	5:55:57	so that s about IY would say
315	5:56:7	5:56:14	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
316	5:57:35	5:57:42	and is to the left
317	5:58:14	5:58:20	and then
319	5:59:28	5:59:33	ok 
321	6:2:44	6:2:48	ok

325	6:10:33	6:10:38	ok
327	6:12:4	6:12:6	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
329	6:14:36	6:14:45	slight
330	6:14:58	6:15:0	IY re starting at the stony desert
331	6:15:18	6:15:24	uhm
332	6:20:8	6:20:10	and IY re going up like
334	6:24:23	6:24:29	and
335	6:25:48	6:25:54	so IY make that circle
336	6:28:39	6:28:45	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
337	6:28:48	6:28:48	ok
338	6:29:41	6:29:43	three inches straight across
340	6:34:7	6:34:12	IY re just going down
341	6:34:40	6:34:45	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
342	6:38:3	6:38:11	and then
start f
1	0:5:38	0:5:45	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
8	0:16:6	0:16:14	nope

37	0:50:44	0:50:50	ok
38	0:51:27	0:51:31	ok
47	1:7:25	1:7:30	do IY go by the plane crash 
51	1:14:18	1:14:21	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
54	1:16:38	1:16:41	and to the right 
55	1:16:42	1:16:47	am IY supposed to start at the same place

108	2:20:1	2:20:1	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
109	2:19:56	2:20:3	around the lake to the top 
110	2:22:2	2:22:2	up tp the right
111	2:24:11	2:24:13	yeah
114	2:35:19	2:35:19	around the top of the lake

136	2:58:42	2:58:42	ok
138	3:0:17	3:0:20	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
140	3:1:9	3:1:17	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
145	3:5:53	3:5:56	mm hmm
147	3:6:21	3:6:21	to the left
148	3:7:9	3:7:12	yeah

193	3:47:25	3:47:26	ok
202	3:52:45	3:52:52	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
204	3:58:15	3:58:21	uhm my
212	4:8:31	4:8:34	ok
215	4:10:8	4:10:16	mm hmm
216	4:10:38	4:10:42	IY ve a plane crash though

0	0:2:22	0:2:25	ok
2	0:6:4	0:6:12	and IY slope is about an inch long
3	0:8:0	0:8:1	then

10	0:17:43	0:17:50	well just
11	0:18:36	0:18:40	ok IY plane crash isn t there
13	0:22:42	0:22:46	couple inches IY re sloping down
14	0:23:52	0:23:57	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
15	0:24:19	0:24:20	ok
16	0:24:45	0:24:52	that s about five or six inches
17	0:25:51	0:25:56	maybe like

28	0:38:16	0:38:24	well
30	0:39:15	0:39:17	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
32	0:41:22	0:41:22	and then IY go straight
33	0:45:36	0:45:45	no
34	0:46:15	0:46:20	what 
35	0:48:20	0:48:29	about like
39	0:53:3	0:53:12	IY plane crash 
40	0:58:16	0:58:20	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
41	0:58:15	0:58:21	and then IY slope up
42	0:59:58	1:0:0	IY move to the left
43	1:4:55	1:4:59	IY re at the plane crash
44	1:5:45	1:5:45	IY make
45	1:6:29	1:6:33	yes IY re going towards the lake
46	1:6:44	1:6:53	IY re going like
48	1:10:54	1:11:1	ok
49	1:12:12	1:12:16	yes
50	1:13:48	1:13:49	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
52	1:15:18	1:15:24	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
53	1:16:14	1:16:17	kind of across from stony desert
56	1:16:48	1:16:52	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
58	1:19:51	1:19:58	and IY go to the left a little bit
59	1:20:1	1:20:1	a quarter of an inch
60	1:20:50	1:20:50	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
62	1:24:3	1:24:4	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
63	1:27:14	1:27:14	ok and then IY re going
64	1:30:21	1:30:27	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
65	1:33:42	1:33:46	and then
67	1:35:48	1:35:50	IY slope down again
68	1:35:55	1:36:2	to the lake 
69	1:36:54	1:37:2	and then IY re going down
70	1:37:9	1:37:17	couple miles or something
71	1:38:11	1:38:11	and IY should have a straight line there
72	1:38:12	1:38:17	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
73	1:39:45	1:39:48	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
74	1:42:7	1:42:7	straight up
75	1:42:5	1:42:7	three inches
76	1:43:42	1:43:50	alright alright well just
77	1:46:20	1:46:21	ok
78	1:46:24	1:46:25	for like
79	1:48:21	1:48:22	for like
80	1:48:28	1:48:31	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
82	1:52:20	1:52:26	ok
83	1:52:32	1:52:37	no
85	1:55:40	1:55:48	so IY go three inches straight
88	1:57:7	1:57:14	is the plane crash  
89	2:1:0	2:1:4	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
90	2:1:37	2:1:41	to the left
92	2:4:16	2:4:24	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
93	2:6:30	2:6:34	uh like
94	2:9:16	2:9:23	and that s where the plane crash is
95	2:9:42	2:9:50	IY wanna kind of curve
96	2:12:0	2:12:3	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
98	2:14:20	2:14:26	ok
99	2:14:41	2:14:47	and then IY ll come to a savannah
100	2:14:47	2:14:54	ok
101	2:16:15	2:16:23	it s not a big curve
102	2:16:24	2:16:28	like four or five inches to the left
103	2:16:57	2:17:4	uhm
105	2:17:29	2:17:37	to the white mountain
112	2:24:32	2:24:39	maybe like
113	2:32:38	2:32:46	are IY anywhere near there 
115	2:42:26	2:42:29	around the bottom of it
116	2:43:36	2:43:43	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
118	2:45:54	2:45:55	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
120	2:47:14	2:47:22	alright well IY ll keep going and see
121	2:47:35	2:47:40	what 
122	2:48:1	2:48:8	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
123	2:48:31	2:48:32	and then
124	2:49:1	2:49:4	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
125	2:49:3	2:49:6	and IY re sloping to the left
126	2:51:7	2:51:12	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
128	2:52:3	2:52:7	and
130	2:53:16	2:53:25	ok
131	2:55:3	2:55:10	uhm
132	2:58:12	2:58:18	probably the same thing
133	2:58:33	2:58:40	after plane crash
134	2:58:33	2:58:41	to the right
137	2:58:55	2:59:3	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
139	3:1:7	3:1:11	just do it like this ok
141	3:2:30	3:2:38	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
142	3:3:47	3:3:54	and there s a plane crash
143	3:4:25	3:4:31	no IY have  
144	3:5:26	3:5:33	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
146	3:6:3	3:6:10	are IY in like   
150	3:8:38	3:8:42	an inch maybe a little bit less
151	3:10:16	3:10:18	IY re kind of going

155	3:14:16	3:14:23	to the left
156	3:14:25	3:14:28	IY re sloping
161	3:21:11	3:21:14	where IY re going down to a plane crash
162	3:22:37	3:22:46	IY would say
163	3:23:55	3:24:1	well alright
164	3:24:11	3:24:13	uhm
165	3:24:54	3:24:57	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything

172	3:28:30	3:28:30	and 
173	3:29:39	3:29:42	for about two inches
174	3:29:46	3:29:47	so IY re at the hot springs
175	3:30:25	3:30:31	like IY re sloping
176	3:30:39	3:30:45	you
178	3:32:56	3:32:56	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
179	3:34:13	3:34:14	IY go straight down
182	3:36:1	3:36:6	uhm
183	3:36:37	3:36:45	ok well
184	3:37:43	3:37:43	maybe four inches on the paper
185	3:39:25	3:39:28	IY don t know
186	3:41:35	3:41:39	and then
187	3:42:20	3:42:24	like maybe an inch

191	3:45:27	3:45:33	IY re starting
194	3:47:28	3:47:34	and IY go down IY slope to the right
195	3:47:47	3:47:47	and IY re going straight up
196	3:48:24	3:48:29	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
197	3:50:29	3:50:32	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
198	3:50:43	3:50:43	that s IY little slope
199	3:51:22	3:51:24	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
200	3:51:43	3:51:45	and then IY slope
201	3:52:34	3:52:38	so
203	3:54:22	3:54:29	uhm
205	4:0:18	4:0:20	five
206	4:3:18	4:3:24	they re there
207	4:3:46	4:3:50	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
208	4:3:51	4:3:51	go up like three  three and a half inches
209	4:5:17	4:5:26	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
210	4:5:27	4:5:29	and IY just go straight up
211	4:5:46	4:5:53	so anyway
213	4:8:26	4:8:35	from
214	4:9:37	4:9:40	ok

225	4:20:22	4:20:26	uhm
226	4:21:26	4:21:27	ok
228	4:23:57	4:23:59	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
229	4:26:55	4:27:4	but
230	4:29:0	4:29:7	IY re actually starting like right
231	4:29:43	4:29:51	ok
232	4:30:48	4:30:54	like
234	4:35:13	4:35:16	ok
236	4:36:24	4:36:28	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
237	4:39:38	4:39:47	maybe
238	4:41:55	4:42:1	to the left
240	4:46:21	4:46:30	and then
241	4:47:13	4:47:14	no IY don t have any rocks
242	4:48:8	4:48:9	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
245	4:49:0	4:49:2	ok
246	4:49:6	4:49:12	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
248	4:52:5	4:52:10	uhm
252	4:55:9	4:55:14	yes
253	4:57:55	4:57:59	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
254	5:1:31	5:1:33	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
255	5:2:11	5:2:13	and it slopes a little bit to the right
256	5:2:38	5:2:39	alright 
257	5:2:49	5:2:52	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
258	5:7:44	5:7:46	the slate mountain is towards the right
260	5:9:25	5:9:33	and then
261	5:11:26	5:11:29	to IY right 
262	5:13:14	5:13:18	not right at the stony desert
264	5:16:34	5:16:43	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
265	5:17:53	5:17:59	and then IY go
268	5:21:22	5:21:23	IY just kind of slope down
269	5:22:37	5:22:38	ok
270	5:23:15	5:23:24	ok
271	5:23:21	5:23:26	uhm and there is a stony desert
272	5:23:36	5:23:36	and then IY  IY go up
273	5:24:56	5:25:0	uhm
274	5:25:25	5:25:28	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
275	5:25:35	5:25:38	there s a there s  
276	5:27:21	5:27:23	uhm
277	5:27:38	5:27:40	and IY re going

279	5:29:37	5:29:37	ok
283	5:31:44	5:31:44	and then IY slope down to the left
284	5:35:3	5:35:8	and then IY are
285	5:35:45	5:35:47	after the circle
286	5:35:55	5:35:59	four or five inches to the left
287	5:37:15	5:37:24	no there s no elephants
288	5:37:27	5:37:30	no IY don t have a waterhole
289	5:37:54	5:37:56	uhm
291	5:39:15	5:39:23	and then
292	5:40:34	5:40:34	three inches
293	5:41:12	5:41:15	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
294	5:41:42	5:41:51	are IY  
295	5:41:58	5:42:6	it s right next to it
296	5:42:19	5:42:26	ok
297	5:43:11	5:43:14	alright are IY starting  near the  
298	5:43:25	5:43:26	maybe IY have different things
299	5:43:31	5:43:31	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
300	5:43:35	5:43:42	just a slight slope
301	5:43:58	5:44:0	ok
302	5:44:29	5:44:38	ok
303	5:45:18	5:45:23	after that IY go straight again
304	5:47:27	5:47:35	are IY in like almost the top of the
305	5:48:39	5:48:41	like an inch
307	5:49:21	5:49:26	ok
308	5:49:26	5:49:32	do IY have roman baths 
309	5:52:13	5:52:18	after IY slope down IY d say
310	5:52:29	5:52:34	ok
311	5:52:30	5:52:34	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
313	5:54:22	5:54:27	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
314	5:55:50	5:55:57	so that s about IY would say
315	5:56:7	5:56:14	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
316	5:57:35	5:57:42	and is to the left
317	5:58:14	5:58:20	and then
319	5:59:28	5:59:33	ok 
321	6:2:44	6:2:48	ok
