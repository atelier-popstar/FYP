start
0:0:21	0:0:26	f	mm hmm
0:0:19	0:0:28	f	yeah
0:1:26	0:1:32	g	to the lake 
0:2:14	0:2:17	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
0:2:28	0:2:28	g	ok
0:5:25	0:5:30	f	uhm my
0:5:45	0:5:45	g	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
0:6:36	0:6:37	g	IY re just going down
0:6:54	0:6:56	g	uhm
0:6:54	0:7:0	f	IY go to a lake 
0:8:30	0:8:30	g	couple miles or something
0:13:41	0:13:46	g	have a s 
0:13:43	0:13:47	f	and
0:15:7	0:15:10	g	a little
0:15:11	0:15:15	f	do IY go around it 
0:15:12	0:15:21	g	no there s no elephants
0:15:59	0:16:8	f	ok
0:16:49	0:16:53	g	after that IY go straight again
0:16:57	0:17:1	g	like
0:16:55	0:17:3	g	three inches
0:17:43	0:17:48	g	so IY make that circle
0:19:32	0:19:34	g	ok
0:19:35	0:19:35	g	maybe like
0:20:43	0:20:49	g	and there s a plane crash
0:21:22	0:21:29	g	and then
0:22:4	0:22:4	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
0:22:34	0:22:35	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
0:22:29	0:22:35	g	for about two inches
0:23:18	0:23:21	g	is the plane crash  
0:23:43	0:23:52	g	uh like
0:24:26	0:24:35	g	uhm
0:24:35	0:24:43	g	and IY go to the left a little bit
0:25:13	0:25:15	g	like
0:25:47	0:25:49	f	uh IY don t know know what to say
0:26:25	0:26:29	g	and then IY go straight
0:27:13	0:27:18	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
0:27:41	0:27:49	g	hmm
0:29:9	0:29:10	f	elephants 
0:33:38	0:33:41	f	yeah
0:34:17	0:34:25	g	ok
0:35:9	0:35:14	g	are IY anywere near there 
0:35:33	0:35:37	g	do IY have roman baths 
0:38:24	0:38:27	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
0:39:42	0:39:47	g	uhm
0:40:8	0:40:10	f	do IY go through anything 
0:40:25	0:40:32	g	and IY should have a straight line there
0:40:33	0:40:40	f	mm hmm
0:43:35	0:43:39	g	are IY  
0:44:39	0:44:44	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
0:44:46	0:44:48	g	around the bottom of it
0:45:32	0:45:39	g	no IY don t have a waterhole
0:46:7	0:46:11	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
0:46:12	0:46:21	f	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
0:48:14	0:48:15	g	uhm
0:48:57	0:49:2	g	well
0:49:46	0:49:52	f	ok
0:50:9	0:50:13	f	ok
0:50:40	0:50:46	g	maybe IY have different things
0:50:50	0:50:59	f	ok
0:51:4	0:51:11	g	alright 
0:54:1	0:54:7	f	ok
0:54:57	0:54:58	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
0:55:5	0:55:10	g	after plane crash
0:56:12	0:56:18	g	uhm
0:57:0	0:57:0	f	yeah 
0:57:50	0:57:56	g	the  
0:58:12	0:58:17	g	uhm
0:58:35	0:58:42	f	 IY m at the savannah
0:59:19	0:59:24	f	yeah 
1:0:25	1:0:34	g	IY re going about
1:1:2	1:1:8	g	but
1:3:28	1:3:35	g	like maybe an inch
1:3:58	1:4:7	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
1:4:39	1:4:43	g	probably the same thing
1:5:9	1:5:10	g	uhm
1:5:55	1:5:58	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
1:6:55	1:6:59	f	ok
1:7:1	1:7:5	f	nope
1:9:10	1:9:17	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
1:9:12	1:9:20	g	after IY slope down IY d say
1:10:3	1:10:10	g	well just
1:10:15	1:10:22	g	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
1:10:27	1:10:28	g	uhm
1:13:0	1:13:4	g	and IY re sloping to the left
1:14:14	1:14:20	f	ok
1:14:13	1:14:22	f	and then what 
1:14:24	1:14:30	g	for like
1:18:11	1:18:14	g	ok
1:18:43	1:18:46	f	to the right 
1:18:50	1:18:54	g	for like
1:19:15	1:19:22	g	they re there
1:21:10	1:21:18	g	and 
1:22:27	1:22:31	g	and then
1:25:5	1:25:9	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
1:26:7	1:26:12	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
1:27:2	1:27:4	g	what 
1:27:10	1:27:18	g	ok
1:28:46	1:28:49	f	mm hmm
1:29:6	1:29:10	g	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
1:29:42	1:29:43	g	yes IY re going towards the lake
1:30:12	1:30:15	g	and then
1:31:17	1:31:17	g	no IY don t have any rocks
1:32:1	1:32:2	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
1:32:1	1:32:8	g	after the circle
1:32:9	1:32:14	f	ok
1:35:37	1:35:37	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
1:38:50	1:38:54	f	ok
1:40:10	1:40:16	g	IY got that 
1:42:59	1:43:6	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
1:43:16	1:43:24	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
1:43:26	1:43:35	g	a quarter of an inch
1:44:56	1:44:58	f	yeah
1:46:15	1:46:23	g	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
1:48:28	1:48:30	g	and then
1:48:34	1:48:34	g	not right at the stony desert
1:50:35	1:50:43	f	mm hmm
1:52:10	1:52:11	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
1:53:27	1:53:29	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
1:54:32	1:54:39	f	nope IY have a white mountain
1:55:11	1:55:14	f	ok
1:59:4	1:59:6	g	IY move to the left
2:0:5	2:0:12	g	uhm
2:0:13	2:0:15	g	maybe
2:0:25	2:0:28	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
2:1:5	2:1:8	f	yeah
2:2:50	2:2:58	g	to the left
2:9:10	2:9:15	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
2:9:27	2:9:35	g	like
2:9:45	2:9:48	g	and then IY are
2:10:9	2:10:17	g	IY wanna kind of curve
2:10:21	2:10:30	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
2:11:0	2:11:8	g	alright alright well just
2:11:41	2:11:45	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
2:12:8	2:12:14	g	no
2:12:14	2:12:19	f	yeah IY see that
2:13:36	2:13:36	g	and is to the left
2:14:14	2:14:14	f	yeah
2:15:34	2:15:38	f	ok
2:17:46	2:17:49	g	and 
2:20:39	2:20:46	f	ok
2:21:1	2:21:6	g	ok
2:21:22	2:21:28	g	uhm
2:23:48	2:23:51	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
2:24:17	2:24:22	g	ok
2:25:6	2:25:15	g	ok and then IY re going
2:26:22	2:26:23	f	mm  mm
2:26:51	2:27:0	g	uhm
2:27:40	2:27:45	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
2:28:39	2:28:45	g	on IY sheet anyway
2:29:18	2:29:25	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
2:30:6	2:30:15	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
2:30:45	2:30:52	g	like an inch
2:36:21	2:36:28	g	maybe four inches on the paper
2:39:6	2:39:14	g	ok
2:39:35	2:39:42	g	ok
2:40:12	2:40:18	g	just a slight slope
2:40:18	2:40:21	g	it s not a big curve
2:41:34	2:41:42	g	to the white mountain
2:42:2	2:42:4	f	to the left
2:42:45	2:42:51	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
2:44:55	2:44:57	g	uhhh no
2:49:8	2:49:15	g	and then IY  IY go up
2:54:25	2:54:34	g	are IY anywhere near there 
2:55:12	2:55:19	g	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
2:58:35	2:58:44	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
3:2:40	3:2:45	g	five
3:3:44	3:3:46	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
3:3:43	3:3:50	g	a little bit too
3:5:16	3:5:16	g	and then
3:6:8	3:6:12	f	and to the right 
3:7:40	3:7:45	f	around the lake to the top 
3:8:28	3:8:30	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
3:8:55	3:8:55	f	ok
3:11:36	3:11:41	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
3:11:53	3:11:57	g	and
3:16:20	3:16:27	f	mm hmm
3:18:33	3:18:33	g	IY re starting at the stony desert
3:18:30	3:18:37	f	yep
3:19:22	3:19:28	g	ok
3:19:27	3:19:30	g	kind of across from stony desert
3:20:6	3:20:12	g	four or five inches to the left
3:20:59	3:21:0	f	ok wait hold on
3:21:45	3:21:46	g	IY make
3:22:36	3:22:45	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
3:22:39	3:22:46	g	IY just kind of slope down
3:23:54	3:24:1	g	that s about five or six inches
3:26:18	3:26:21	g	ok
3:26:19	3:26:27	g	IY re sloping
3:27:24	3:27:32	g	it s right next to it
3:29:24	3:29:24	g	slight
3:33:33	3:33:38	g	you
3:34:26	3:34:29	g	ok
3:37:44	3:37:50	g	uhm
3:38:19	3:38:20	g	and IY re going
3:38:39	3:38:46	g	no IY have  
3:38:46	3:38:52	g	so IY go three inches straight
3:40:14	3:40:21	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
3:41:6	3:41:12	g	what 
3:42:33	3:42:36	g	maybe like
3:43:26	3:43:30	g	and then IY re going down
3:44:51	3:44:52	f	IY know IY have different things so
3:46:5	3:46:12	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
3:47:46	3:47:52	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
3:49:36	3:49:44	g	ok
3:51:4	3:51:12	g	so anyway
3:51:32	3:51:39	f	how many inches do IY think 
3:51:57	3:52:2	f	IY m three inches above the savannah
3:52:13	3:52:15	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
3:53:16	3:53:21	g	ok
3:54:42	3:54:44	g	ok
3:54:58	3:55:5	g	IY slope down again
3:55:20	3:55:23	g	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
3:59:18	3:59:19	g	and IY re going straight up
4:0:2	4:0:7	g	ok
4:4:49	4:4:52	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
4:5:38	4:5:38	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
4:7:9	4:7:17	g	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
4:10:54	4:11:2	f	yeah and IY went straight up
4:11:9	4:11:9	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
4:12:3	4:12:5	f	IY hit some rocks though
4:12:39	4:12:46	g	uhm
4:13:4	4:13:7	g	to the left
4:13:41	4:13:43	g	ok
4:13:49	4:13:54	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
4:13:54	4:14:1	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
4:14:47	4:14:54	f	ok
4:15:13	4:15:18	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
4:15:25	4:15:32	f	ok
4:17:56	4:17:59	f	ok
4:18:26	4:18:29	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
4:18:37	4:18:42	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
4:20:21	4:20:21	g	like
4:20:33	4:20:41	g	ok
4:21:54	4:21:59	g	ok
4:24:43	4:24:52	f	ok
4:24:46	4:24:52	f	ok
4:25:23	4:25:29	f	IY ve a plane crash though
4:25:37	4:25:45	g	well
4:26:17	4:26:18	g	uhm
4:29:45	4:29:47	g	three inches
4:30:29	4:30:33	g	IY would say
4:30:59	4:31:2	f	ok
4:31:25	4:31:25	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
4:34:6	4:34:6	f	IY hit some round rocks
4:34:27	4:34:31	g	and then
4:35:57	4:36:1	g	to the left
4:36:39	4:36:45	g	uhm
4:36:43	4:36:46	g	ok
4:38:0	4:38:1	f	ok
4:40:7	4:40:12	f	to 
4:40:32	4:40:35	g	just do it like this ok
4:43:57	4:44:3	g	so IY re at the hot springs
4:44:41	4:44:45	g	and IY re going up like
4:45:44	4:45:48	g	IY re actually starting like right
4:45:44	4:45:53	g	ok IY re at the savannah
4:46:13	4:46:15	f	to the left of the antelope
4:46:33	4:46:40	g	are IY in like   
4:46:46	4:46:54	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
4:47:47	4:47:54	g	to IY right 
4:50:8	4:50:17	g	ok
4:53:34	4:53:43	g	uhm
4:56:2	4:56:9	g	yes
4:56:50	4:56:51	g	straight up
4:58:5	4:58:11	g	like three inches 
4:58:43	4:58:47	g	so that s about IY would say
5:1:5	5:1:7	g	IY plane crash 
5:1:8	5:1:12	f	ok
5:2:6	5:2:15	g	and then IY slope
5:3:48	5:3:54	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
5:7:7	5:7:14	g	ok
5:8:31	5:8:39	g	and then IY go
5:9:33	5:9:39	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
5:9:41	5:9:49	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
5:10:24	5:10:31	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
5:11:8	5:11:10	g	IY re kind of going  
5:11:47	5:11:47	f	mm hmm
5:11:53	5:11:59	g	three inches straight across
5:12:24	5:12:26	g	and then IY slope up
5:13:45	5:13:54	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
5:14:2	5:14:8	f	around the top of the lake 
5:16:0	5:16:0	g	and IY just go straight up
5:17:52	5:17:59	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
5:18:11	5:18:13	g	IY go straight down
5:18:28	5:18:32	f	ok
5:19:20	5:19:29	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
5:19:35	5:19:36	g	IY re going like
5:20:30	5:20:31	g	IY re starting
5:21:56	5:21:58	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
5:21:55	5:22:0	g	well alright
5:23:8	5:23:11	g	no
5:23:55	5:23:58	g	there s a there s  
5:24:28	5:24:29	g	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
5:26:20	5:26:26	g	and then IY slope down to the left
5:26:28	5:26:29	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
5:27:59	5:28:6	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
5:28:34	5:28:35	g	ok 
5:28:57	5:28:57	f	ok
5:29:19	5:29:21	f	ok

5:38:58	5:39:7	g	and
5:40:54	5:41:3	g	like four or five inches to the left
5:41:54	5:41:55	g	like IY re sloping
5:42:38	5:42:42	f	and curve down to the left 
5:46:53	5:46:59	g	from
5:48:6	5:48:12	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
5:53:23	5:53:30	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
5:53:26	5:53:34	g	an inch maybe a little bit less
5:54:38	5:54:47	f	IY have to back up a little bit
5:55:8	5:55:14	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
5:55:59	5:56:1	g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
