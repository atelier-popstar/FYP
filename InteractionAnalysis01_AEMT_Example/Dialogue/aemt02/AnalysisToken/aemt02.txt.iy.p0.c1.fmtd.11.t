start
start g
0	0:0:12	0:0:15	uhm
2	0:2:16	0:2:24	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
3	0:2:27	0:2:28	do IY have roman baths 
4	0:2:56	0:3:2	uhm
5	0:3:4	0:3:11	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
6	0:5:25	0:5:30	alright are IY starting  near the  
7	0:6:1	0:6:5	ok
8	0:6:9	0:6:10	to the white mountain
9	0:7:51	0:8:0	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
10	0:8:23	0:8:23	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
11	0:12:13	0:12:13	IY make
12	0:12:23	0:12:29	uhm
13	0:13:45	0:13:53	after that IY go straight again
14	0:13:47	0:13:55	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
15	0:14:10	0:14:14	a little bit too
17	0:19:16	0:19:23	hmm
18	0:20:2	0:20:3	straight up
19	0:20:30	0:20:33	go up like three  three and a half inches
20	0:20:57	0:21:3	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
21	0:22:36	0:22:40	an inch maybe a little bit less
22	0:23:26	0:23:32	and it slopes a little bit to the right
23	0:24:0	0:24:7	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
24	0:26:14	0:26:23	not right at the stony desert
26	0:26:58	0:27:2	then
27	0:27:37	0:27:40	the slate mountain is towards the right
28	0:28:20	0:28:27	ok
29	0:31:34	0:31:43	and then IY slope
31	0:31:48	0:31:52	and then
33	0:32:56	0:32:59	ok
36	0:37:1	0:37:7	kind of across from stony desert
38	0:38:6	0:38:6	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
39	0:40:12	0:40:17	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
40	0:42:38	0:42:38	and then IY go
41	0:43:14	0:43:17	uhhh no
42	0:44:21	0:44:21	and then IY are
43	0:45:51	0:45:59	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
45	0:47:26	0:47:26	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
46	0:47:39	0:47:41	so anyway
47	0:47:58	0:48:3	no IY have  
48	0:49:31	0:49:39	and IY re going up like
49	0:52:12	0:52:12	and 
50	0:54:46	0:54:49	uhm
52	0:56:55	0:56:55	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
53	0:57:30	0:57:36	IY re actually starting like right
54	0:58:38	0:58:41	no IY don t have a waterhole
55	0:59:37	0:59:42	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
56	1:0:40	1:0:47	ok
57	1:2:51	1:3:0	uhm
61	1:11:8	1:11:16	couple inches IY re sloping down
63	1:14:27	1:14:33	and
64	1:15:8	1:15:13	no
66	1:15:55	1:16:4	so IY re at the hot springs
67	1:16:9	1:16:10	alright 
69	1:18:0	1:18:9	three inches
70	1:19:16	1:19:23	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
71	1:21:34	1:21:37	what 
72	1:23:38	1:23:39	like IY re sloping
74	1:25:34	1:25:40	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
75	1:26:8	1:26:17	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
76	1:27:43	1:27:46	and 
77	1:28:10	1:28:12	well
78	1:28:27	1:28:27	IY re at the plane crash
80	1:28:33	1:28:35	around the bottom of it
83	1:34:35	1:34:36	like four or five inches to the left
84	1:35:3	1:35:3	uhm
85	1:36:11	1:36:11	IY re going like
86	1:36:4	1:36:12	ok
87	1:36:23	1:36:25	uh like
88	1:38:26	1:38:30	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
89	1:39:9	1:39:16	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
90	1:39:42	1:39:49	ok 
91	1:40:1	1:40:5	ok
92	1:40:7	1:40:15	so
93	1:41:45	1:41:49	IY plane crash 
94	1:41:49	1:41:51	three inches
95	1:41:56	1:41:58	alright 
97	1:46:36	1:46:36	uhm and there is a stony desert
98	1:48:11	1:48:15	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
99	1:51:49	1:51:53	for about two inches
100	1:53:29	1:53:37	just do it like this ok
103	2:0:8	2:0:8	and IY slope is about an inch long
105	2:2:45	2:2:54	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
107	2:5:36	2:5:44	to the right
109	2:7:55	2:8:1	to the left
110	2:8:19	2:8:24	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
111	2:10:7	2:10:12	a little
112	2:11:51	2:11:52	maybe like
113	2:13:12	2:13:21	and then
114	2:14:54	2:15:0	ok
115	2:16:0	2:16:2	are IY in like almost the top of the
116	2:16:13	2:16:14	and then
117	2:18:1	2:18:2	and then IY  IY go up
119	2:19:51	2:19:52	uhm
121	2:22:41	2:22:46	uhm
122	2:22:40	2:22:46	after the circle
123	2:23:7	2:23:15	IY move to the left
124	2:24:29	2:24:34	are IY anywhere near there 
125	2:24:41	2:24:45	ok
126	2:25:21	2:25:24	ok
129	2:26:55	2:27:2	but
130	2:27:9	2:27:9	ok
131	2:27:18	2:27:25	uhm
132	2:27:31	2:27:39	yes
135	2:30:20	2:30:29	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
136	2:31:0	2:31:8	about like
137	2:31:46	2:31:46	and IY go to the left a little bit
138	2:32:2	2:32:5	there s a there s  
139	2:32:27	2:32:35	couple miles or something
140	2:34:47	2:34:55	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
142	2:41:25	2:41:27	and is to the left
143	2:41:33	2:41:34	and there s a plane crash
144	2:42:26	2:42:27	IY slope down again
145	2:42:41	2:42:43	that s IY little slope
147	2:45:20	2:45:21	yes
151	2:48:20	2:48:28	ok well
154	2:51:19	2:51:26	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
155	2:51:36	2:51:42	after IY slope down IY d say
156	2:51:54	2:51:58	three inches straight across
157	2:52:20	2:52:24	you
158	2:53:38	2:53:39	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
160	2:55:22	2:55:22	uhm
163	2:58:9	2:58:12	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
165	2:58:48	2:58:56	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
167	3:2:52	3:2:53	so that s about IY would say
168	3:4:12	3:4:19	five
169	3:4:51	3:4:52	so IY go three inches straight
170	3:6:8	3:6:15	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
172	3:9:25	3:9:31	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
173	3:13:52	3:13:58	well
175	3:18:52	3:18:58	they re there
176	3:20:0	3:20:4	like
178	3:23:17	3:23:19	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
179	3:23:46	3:23:51	alright well IY ll keep going and see
183	3:31:14	3:31:16	like
184	3:34:7	3:34:15	and then
186	3:37:38	3:37:46	to the left
187	3:39:40	3:39:44	ok
188	3:40:32	3:40:33	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
189	3:41:46	3:41:53	ok
190	3:42:28	3:42:30	just a slight slope
191	3:44:26	3:44:28	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
192	3:45:18	3:45:18	no IY don t have any rocks
193	3:45:28	3:45:37	it s not a big curve
198	3:46:51	3:46:53	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
199	3:47:59	3:48:4	to IY right 
200	3:48:18	3:48:20	maybe like
202	3:49:18	3:49:23	and then IY ll come to a savannah
203	3:50:42	3:50:51	uhm
205	3:53:13	3:53:16	it s right next to it
208	3:57:23	3:57:24	uhm
209	3:57:55	3:57:58	ok
211	3:58:34	3:58:42	IY don t know
212	3:58:45	3:58:45	is the plane crash  
214	4:1:18	4:1:25	and then
215	4:4:32	4:4:39	ok IY re at the savannah
216	4:5:45	4:5:45	have a s 
217	4:6:57	4:7:5	ok
219	4:8:52	4:8:55	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
220	4:9:41	4:9:47	ok
221	4:11:56	4:12:2	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
222	4:13:13	4:13:16	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
223	4:13:24	4:13:28	a quarter of an inch
224	4:16:52	4:16:54	ok
225	4:19:55	4:19:59	are IY  
226	4:20:28	4:20:28	uhm

230	4:29:34	4:29:36	ok
231	4:30:37	4:30:45	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
232	4:31:13	4:31:15	from
234	4:33:8	4:33:8	like an inch
239	4:36:19	4:36:25	on IY sheet anyway
240	4:36:54	4:36:59	are IY anywere near there 
241	4:37:25	4:37:32	IY re starting
242	4:37:50	4:37:58	like maybe an inch
243	4:40:54	4:41:1	ok
244	4:41:7	4:41:8	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
245	4:42:3	4:42:10	uhm
247	4:44:35	4:44:42	like
248	4:47:36	4:47:38	IY wanna kind of curve
249	4:47:39	4:47:48	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
252	4:51:12	4:51:19	after plane crash
253	4:53:39	4:53:43	ok
254	4:53:42	4:53:49	and then IY slope down to the left
255	4:54:25	4:54:32	yes IY re going towards the lake
256	4:54:48	4:54:53	the  
257	4:55:1	4:55:3	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
259	4:56:59	4:57:0	are IY in like   
260	4:57:19	4:57:26	ok
261	4:59:26	4:59:30	uhm
263	5:3:59	5:4:8	like
264	5:6:0	5:6:4	IY go straight down
266	5:8:19	5:8:20	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
268	5:11:26	5:11:26	that s about five or six inches
269	5:11:59	5:12:0	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
270	5:12:0	5:12:2	and then IY slope up
271	5:12:30	5:12:35	to the left
274	5:13:49	5:13:57	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
275	5:14:9	5:14:16	for like
277	5:15:17	5:15:21	uhm
278	5:16:18	5:16:18	ok IY plane crash isn t there
279	5:17:10	5:17:16	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
280	5:17:32	5:17:39	IY got that 
281	5:18:23	5:18:30	and IY re sloping to the left
283	5:19:40	5:19:44	ok well
284	5:20:24	5:20:29	so IY make that circle
285	5:21:57	5:21:59	and IY just go straight up
287	5:22:16	5:22:19	probably the same thing
290	5:23:0	5:23:5	well alright
291	5:23:17	5:23:19	well just
293	5:23:24	5:23:31	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
294	5:24:30	5:24:33	maybe four inches on the paper
297	5:26:52	5:26:59	ok
298	5:27:26	5:27:27	uhm
301	5:30:51	5:30:57	maybe
302	5:31:0	5:31:6	ok and then IY re going
303	5:33:8	5:33:15	IY just kind of slope down
304	5:34:59	5:35:5	and IY go down IY slope to the right
305	5:35:7	5:35:10	no there s no elephants
306	5:35:21	5:35:21	and then
307	5:36:54	5:36:55	IY would say
308	5:37:38	5:37:43	and IY re going straight up
309	5:38:3	5:38:3	no
310	5:38:9	5:38:10	like three inches 
311	5:39:29	5:39:29	four or five inches to the left
312	5:41:34	5:41:37	IY re starting at the stony desert
313	5:41:30	5:41:39	IY re kind of going  
315	5:43:40	5:43:46	what 
316	5:43:51	5:43:52	and IY should have a straight line there
317	5:44:58	5:45:4	IY re sloping
318	5:45:37	5:45:46	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
319	5:47:17	5:47:21	and then IY re going down
320	5:48:0	5:48:8	and then IY go straight
321	5:50:0	5:50:9	and IY re going
322	5:58:53	5:58:58	alright alright well just
323	6:0:49	6:0:56	IY re going about
324	6:3:38	6:3:45	where IY re going down to a plane crash
325	6:6:2	6:6:9	for like
326	6:9:32	6:9:38	to the lake 
327	6:10:33	6:10:33	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
330	6:13:41	6:13:50	and then
331	6:14:11	6:14:19	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
332	6:14:33	6:14:34	and that s where the plane crash is
333	6:15:50	6:15:51	maybe IY have different things
335	6:17:18	6:17:19	slight
336	6:18:13	6:18:13	ok
337	6:19:32	6:19:35	ok
339	6:20:39	6:20:48	and then
342	6:25:12	6:25:20	IY re just going down
start f
1	0:1:2	0:1:5	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
16	0:16:50	0:16:57	and curve down to the left 
25	0:26:51	0:26:55	IY know IY have different things so
30	0:31:38	0:31:46	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
32	0:32:30	0:32:30	ok
34	0:32:57	0:33:2	IY have to back up a little bit
35	0:35:59	0:36:8	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
37	0:38:3	0:38:4	and then what 
44	0:47:0	0:47:4	to 
51	0:55:9	0:55:9	ok
58	1:4:15	1:4:15	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
59	1:4:54	1:4:55	and to the right 
60	1:7:31	1:7:33	elephants 
62	1:13:51	1:13:51	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
65	1:15:45	1:15:49	ok
68	1:16:53	1:16:57	mm hmm
73	1:23:52	1:23:59	ok

81	1:29:8	1:29:8	ok
82	1:31:56	1:31:58	to the left
96	1:42:2	1:42:10	yeah
101	1:55:4	1:55:5	IY go to a lake 
102	1:58:59	1:58:59	mm hmm
104	2:0:32	2:0:39	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
106	2:3:25	2:3:25	yeah
108	2:5:44	2:5:52	yep
118	2:17:59	2:18:8	and there s a collapsed shelter
120	2:20:44	2:20:49	 IY m at the savannah
127	2:25:46	2:25:51	ok
128	2:26:31	2:26:35	ok
133	2:29:11	2:29:16	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
134	2:29:13	2:29:19	mm  mm
141	2:35:4	2:35:4	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
146	2:44:12	2:44:12	IY m three inches above the savannah
148	2:46:46	2:46:51	around the lake to the top 
149	2:48:2	2:48:4	ok
150	2:48:8	2:48:17	mm hmm
152	2:48:36	2:48:37	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
153	2:50:9	2:50:12	around the top of the lake 
159	2:54:7	2:54:12	to the left of the antelope
161	2:56:18	2:56:24	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
162	2:56:54	2:56:55	do IY go by the plane crash 
164	2:58:39	2:58:41	ok
166	2:59:25	2:59:34	mm hmm
171	3:8:52	3:8:59	ok

195	3:46:24	3:46:24	IY hit some rocks though
196	3:46:24	3:46:27	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
197	3:46:43	3:46:48	ok
201	3:48:20	3:48:23	nope
204	3:51:17	3:51:19	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
206	3:53:14	3:53:16	so wait
207	3:56:15	3:56:19	how many inches do IY think 
210	3:58:22	3:58:29	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
213	3:58:44	3:58:53	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
218	4:8:12	4:8:17	ok
229	4:25:12	4:25:17	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
233	4:33:2	4:33:7	IY ve a plane crash though
235	4:33:35	4:33:44	to the right 
236	4:34:5	4:34:11	yeah IY see that
237	4:34:35	4:34:43	oh

276	5:14:23	5:14:25	do IY go through anything 
282	5:18:28	5:18:33	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
286	5:22:13	5:22:18	uhm my
288	5:22:15	5:22:24	ok
289	5:23:3	5:23:3	yeah 
292	5:23:24	5:23:24	ok

296	5:26:26	5:26:27	and
299	5:27:57	5:28:0	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
300	5:28:35	5:28:40	IY hit some round rocks
314	5:42:3	5:42:9	yeah and IY went straight up
328	6:10:55	6:11:4	ok
329	6:13:44	6:13:44	ok

338	6:20:30	6:20:35	ok
340	6:22:4	6:22:8	nope IY have a white mountain
341	6:24:9	6:24:14	ok
start g
0	0:0:12	0:0:15	uhm
2	0:2:16	0:2:24	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
3	0:2:27	0:2:28	do IY have roman baths 
4	0:2:56	0:3:2	uhm
5	0:3:4	0:3:11	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
6	0:5:25	0:5:30	alright are IY starting  near the  
7	0:6:1	0:6:5	ok
8	0:6:9	0:6:10	to the white mountain
9	0:7:51	0:8:0	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
10	0:8:23	0:8:23	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
11	0:12:13	0:12:13	IY make
12	0:12:23	0:12:29	uhm
13	0:13:45	0:13:53	after that IY go straight again
14	0:13:47	0:13:55	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
15	0:14:10	0:14:14	a little bit too
17	0:19:16	0:19:23	hmm
18	0:20:2	0:20:3	straight up
19	0:20:30	0:20:33	go up like three  three and a half inches
20	0:20:57	0:21:3	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
21	0:22:36	0:22:40	an inch maybe a little bit less
22	0:23:26	0:23:32	and it slopes a little bit to the right
23	0:24:0	0:24:7	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
24	0:26:14	0:26:23	not right at the stony desert
26	0:26:58	0:27:2	then
27	0:27:37	0:27:40	the slate mountain is towards the right
28	0:28:20	0:28:27	ok
29	0:31:34	0:31:43	and then IY slope
31	0:31:48	0:31:52	and then
33	0:32:56	0:32:59	ok
36	0:37:1	0:37:7	kind of across from stony desert
38	0:38:6	0:38:6	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
39	0:40:12	0:40:17	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
40	0:42:38	0:42:38	and then IY go
41	0:43:14	0:43:17	uhhh no
42	0:44:21	0:44:21	and then IY are
43	0:45:51	0:45:59	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
45	0:47:26	0:47:26	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
46	0:47:39	0:47:41	so anyway
47	0:47:58	0:48:3	no IY have  
48	0:49:31	0:49:39	and IY re going up like
49	0:52:12	0:52:12	and 
50	0:54:46	0:54:49	uhm
52	0:56:55	0:56:55	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
53	0:57:30	0:57:36	IY re actually starting like right
54	0:58:38	0:58:41	no IY don t have a waterhole
55	0:59:37	0:59:42	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
56	1:0:40	1:0:47	ok
57	1:2:51	1:3:0	uhm
61	1:11:8	1:11:16	couple inches IY re sloping down
63	1:14:27	1:14:33	and
64	1:15:8	1:15:13	no
66	1:15:55	1:16:4	so IY re at the hot springs
67	1:16:9	1:16:10	alright 
69	1:18:0	1:18:9	three inches
70	1:19:16	1:19:23	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
71	1:21:34	1:21:37	what 
72	1:23:38	1:23:39	like IY re sloping
74	1:25:34	1:25:40	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
75	1:26:8	1:26:17	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
76	1:27:43	1:27:46	and 
77	1:28:10	1:28:12	well
78	1:28:27	1:28:27	IY re at the plane crash
80	1:28:33	1:28:35	around the bottom of it
83	1:34:35	1:34:36	like four or five inches to the left
84	1:35:3	1:35:3	uhm
85	1:36:11	1:36:11	IY re going like
86	1:36:4	1:36:12	ok
87	1:36:23	1:36:25	uh like
88	1:38:26	1:38:30	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
89	1:39:9	1:39:16	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
90	1:39:42	1:39:49	ok 
91	1:40:1	1:40:5	ok
92	1:40:7	1:40:15	so
93	1:41:45	1:41:49	IY plane crash 
94	1:41:49	1:41:51	three inches
95	1:41:56	1:41:58	alright 
97	1:46:36	1:46:36	uhm and there is a stony desert
98	1:48:11	1:48:15	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
99	1:51:49	1:51:53	for about two inches
100	1:53:29	1:53:37	just do it like this ok
103	2:0:8	2:0:8	and IY slope is about an inch long
105	2:2:45	2:2:54	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
107	2:5:36	2:5:44	to the right
109	2:7:55	2:8:1	to the left
110	2:8:19	2:8:24	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
111	2:10:7	2:10:12	a little
112	2:11:51	2:11:52	maybe like
113	2:13:12	2:13:21	and then
114	2:14:54	2:15:0	ok
115	2:16:0	2:16:2	are IY in like almost the top of the
116	2:16:13	2:16:14	and then
117	2:18:1	2:18:2	and then IY  IY go up
119	2:19:51	2:19:52	uhm
121	2:22:41	2:22:46	uhm
122	2:22:40	2:22:46	after the circle
123	2:23:7	2:23:15	IY move to the left
124	2:24:29	2:24:34	are IY anywhere near there 
125	2:24:41	2:24:45	ok
126	2:25:21	2:25:24	ok
129	2:26:55	2:27:2	but
130	2:27:9	2:27:9	ok

132	2:27:31	2:27:39	yes
135	2:30:20	2:30:29	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
136	2:31:0	2:31:8	about like
137	2:31:46	2:31:46	and IY go to the left a little bit
138	2:32:2	2:32:5	there s a there s  
139	2:32:27	2:32:35	couple miles or something
140	2:34:47	2:34:55	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
142	2:41:25	2:41:27	and is to the left
143	2:41:33	2:41:34	and there s a plane crash
144	2:42:26	2:42:27	IY slope down again
145	2:42:41	2:42:43	that s IY little slope
147	2:45:20	2:45:21	yes
151	2:48:20	2:48:28	ok well
154	2:51:19	2:51:26	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
155	2:51:36	2:51:42	after IY slope down IY d say
156	2:51:54	2:51:58	three inches straight across
157	2:52:20	2:52:24	you
158	2:53:38	2:53:39	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
160	2:55:22	2:55:22	uhm
163	2:58:9	2:58:12	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
165	2:58:48	2:58:56	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
167	3:2:52	3:2:53	so that s about IY would say
168	3:4:12	3:4:19	five
169	3:4:51	3:4:52	so IY go three inches straight
170	3:6:8	3:6:15	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
172	3:9:25	3:9:31	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
173	3:13:52	3:13:58	well
175	3:18:52	3:18:58	they re there
176	3:20:0	3:20:4	like
178	3:23:17	3:23:19	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
179	3:23:46	3:23:51	alright well IY ll keep going and see
183	3:31:14	3:31:16	like
184	3:34:7	3:34:15	and then
186	3:37:38	3:37:46	to the left
187	3:39:40	3:39:44	ok
188	3:40:32	3:40:33	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
189	3:41:46	3:41:53	ok
190	3:42:28	3:42:30	just a slight slope
191	3:44:26	3:44:28	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
192	3:45:18	3:45:18	no IY don t have any rocks
193	3:45:28	3:45:37	it s not a big curve
198	3:46:51	3:46:53	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
199	3:47:59	3:48:4	to IY right 
200	3:48:18	3:48:20	maybe like
202	3:49:18	3:49:23	and then IY ll come to a savannah
203	3:50:42	3:50:51	uhm
205	3:53:13	3:53:16	it s right next to it
208	3:57:23	3:57:24	uhm
209	3:57:55	3:57:58	ok
211	3:58:34	3:58:42	IY don t know
212	3:58:45	3:58:45	is the plane crash  
214	4:1:18	4:1:25	and then
215	4:4:32	4:4:39	ok IY re at the savannah
216	4:5:45	4:5:45	have a s 
217	4:6:57	4:7:5	ok
219	4:8:52	4:8:55	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
220	4:9:41	4:9:47	ok
221	4:11:56	4:12:2	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
222	4:13:13	4:13:16	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
223	4:13:24	4:13:28	a quarter of an inch
224	4:16:52	4:16:54	ok
225	4:19:55	4:19:59	are IY

230	4:29:34	4:29:36	ok
231	4:30:37	4:30:45	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
232	4:31:13	4:31:15	from
234	4:33:8	4:33:8	like an inch
239	4:36:19	4:36:25	on IY sheet anyway
240	4:36:54	4:36:59	are IY anywere near there 
241	4:37:25	4:37:32	IY re starting
242	4:37:50	4:37:58	like maybe an inch
243	4:40:54	4:41:1	ok
244	4:41:7	4:41:8	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
245	4:42:3	4:42:10	uhm
247	4:44:35	4:44:42	like
248	4:47:36	4:47:38	IY wanna kind of curve
249	4:47:39	4:47:48	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
252	4:51:12	4:51:19	after plane crash
253	4:53:39	4:53:43	ok
254	4:53:42	4:53:49	and then IY slope down to the left
255	4:54:25	4:54:32	yes IY re going towards the lake
256	4:54:48	4:54:53	the  
257	4:55:1	4:55:3	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
259	4:56:59	4:57:0	are IY in like   
260	4:57:19	4:57:26	ok
261	4:59:26	4:59:30	uhm
263	5:3:59	5:4:8	like
264	5:6:0	5:6:4	IY go straight down
266	5:8:19	5:8:20	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
268	5:11:26	5:11:26	that s about five or six inches
269	5:11:59	5:12:0	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
270	5:12:0	5:12:2	and then IY slope up
271	5:12:30	5:12:35	to the left
274	5:13:49	5:13:57	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
275	5:14:9	5:14:16	for like
277	5:15:17	5:15:21	uhm
278	5:16:18	5:16:18	ok IY plane crash isn t there
279	5:17:10	5:17:16	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
280	5:17:32	5:17:39	IY got that 
281	5:18:23	5:18:30	and IY re sloping to the left
283	5:19:40	5:19:44	ok well
284	5:20:24	5:20:29	so IY make that circle
285	5:21:57	5:21:59	and IY just go straight up
287	5:22:16	5:22:19	probably the same thing
290	5:23:0	5:23:5	well alright
291	5:23:17	5:23:19	well just
293	5:23:24	5:23:31	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
294	5:24:30	5:24:33	maybe four inches on the paper
297	5:26:52	5:26:59	ok
298	5:27:26	5:27:27	uhm
301	5:30:51	5:30:57	maybe
302	5:31:0	5:31:6	ok and then IY re going
303	5:33:8	5:33:15	IY just kind of slope down
304	5:34:59	5:35:5	and IY go down IY slope to the right
305	5:35:7	5:35:10	no there s no elephants
306	5:35:21	5:35:21	and then
307	5:36:54	5:36:55	IY would say
308	5:37:38	5:37:43	and IY re going straight up
309	5:38:3	5:38:3	no
310	5:38:9	5:38:10	like three inches 
311	5:39:29	5:39:29	four or five inches to the left
312	5:41:34	5:41:37	IY re starting at the stony desert
313	5:41:30	5:41:39	IY re kind of going  
315	5:43:40	5:43:46	what 
316	5:43:51	5:43:52	and IY should have a straight line there
317	5:44:58	5:45:4	IY re sloping
318	5:45:37	5:45:46	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
319	5:47:17	5:47:21	and then IY re going down
320	5:48:0	5:48:8	and then IY go straight
321	5:50:0	5:50:9	and IY re going
322	5:58:53	5:58:58	alright alright well just
323	6:0:49	6:0:56	IY re going about
