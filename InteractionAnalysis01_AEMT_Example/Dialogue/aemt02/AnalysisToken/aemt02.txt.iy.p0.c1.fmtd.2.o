start
0:2:22	0:2:25	g	ok
0:5:38	0:5:45	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
0:6:4	0:6:12	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
0:8:0	0:8:1	g	then
0:10:10	0:10:18	g	have a s 
0:11:17	0:11:17	g	like
0:13:41	0:13:42	g	a little
0:15:13	0:15:20	g	on IY sheet anyway
0:16:6	0:16:14	f	nope

0:17:43	0:17:50	g	well just
0:18:36	0:18:40	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
0:22:38	0:22:46	f	to 
0:22:42	0:22:46	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
0:23:52	0:23:57	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
0:24:19	0:24:20	g	ok
0:24:45	0:24:52	g	that s about five or six inches
0:25:51	0:25:56	g	maybe like
0:27:58	0:28:2	g	uhm
0:28:14	0:28:23	g	uhm
0:29:45	0:29:48	f	uh IY don t know know what to say
0:31:22	0:31:26	g	like three inches 
0:32:1	0:32:2	f	ok
0:33:41	0:33:43	g	and 
0:36:11	0:36:14	g	IY re going about

0:38:16	0:38:24	g	well
0:38:56	0:39:2	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
0:39:15	0:39:17	g	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
0:41:22	0:41:22	f	so wait
0:41:22	0:41:22	g	and then IY go straight
0:45:36	0:45:45	g	no

0:50:44	0:50:50	f	ok
0:51:27	0:51:31	f	ok
0:53:3	0:53:12	g	IY plane crash 
0:58:16	0:58:20	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
0:58:15	0:58:21	g	and then IY slope up
0:59:58	1:0:0	g	IY move to the left
1:4:55	1:4:59	g	IY re at the plane crash
1:5:45	1:5:45	g	IY make
1:6:29	1:6:33	g	yes IY re going towards the lake
1:6:44	1:6:53	g	IY re going like
1:7:25	1:7:30	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
1:10:54	1:11:1	g	ok
1:12:12	1:12:16	g	yes
1:13:48	1:13:49	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
1:14:18	1:14:21	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
1:15:18	1:15:24	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
1:16:14	1:16:17	g	kind of across from stony desert
1:16:38	1:16:41	f	and to the right 
1:16:42	1:16:47	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
1:16:48	1:16:52	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
1:19:12	1:19:12	f	ok
1:19:51	1:19:58	g	and IY go to the left a little bit
1:20:1	1:20:1	g	a quarter of an inch
1:20:50	1:20:50	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
1:21:29	1:21:38	f	ok
1:24:3	1:24:4	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
1:27:14	1:27:14	g	ok and then IY re going
1:30:21	1:30:27	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
1:33:42	1:33:46	g	and then
1:33:50	1:33:50	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
1:35:48	1:35:50	g	IY slope down again
1:35:55	1:36:2	g	to the lake 
1:36:54	1:37:2	g	and then IY re going down
1:37:9	1:37:17	g	couple miles or something
1:38:11	1:38:11	g	and IY should have a straight line there
1:38:12	1:38:17	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
1:39:45	1:39:48	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
1:42:7	1:42:7	g	straight up
1:42:5	1:42:7	g	three inches
1:43:42	1:43:50	g	alright alright well just
1:46:20	1:46:21	g	ok
1:46:24	1:46:25	g	for like
1:48:21	1:48:22	g	for like
1:48:28	1:48:31	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
1:50:50	1:50:52	f	ok
1:52:20	1:52:26	g	ok
1:52:32	1:52:37	g	no
1:55:36	1:55:38	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
1:55:40	1:55:48	g	so IY go three inches straight
1:56:27	1:56:29	f	oh
1:56:36	1:56:36	f	nope IY have a white mountain
1:57:7	1:57:14	g	is the plane crash  
2:1:0	2:1:4	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
2:1:37	2:1:41	g	to the left
2:2:31	2:2:37	f	IY hit some rocks though
2:4:16	2:4:24	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
2:6:30	2:6:34	g	uh like
2:9:16	2:9:23	g	and that s where the plane crash is
2:9:42	2:9:50	g	IY wanna kind of curve
2:12:0	2:12:3	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
2:12:3	2:12:7	f	to the left of the antelope
2:14:20	2:14:26	g	ok
2:14:41	2:14:47	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
2:14:47	2:14:54	g	ok
2:16:15	2:16:23	g	it s not a big curve
2:16:24	2:16:28	g	like four or five inches to the left
2:16:57	2:17:4	g	uhm
2:16:59	2:17:7	f	IY have to back up a little bit
2:17:29	2:17:37	g	to the white mountain
2:18:10	2:18:11	f	yeah
2:18:53	2:18:56	f	and
2:20:1	2:20:1	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
2:19:56	2:20:3	f	around the lake to the top 
2:22:2	2:22:2	f	up tp the right
2:24:11	2:24:13	f	yeah
2:24:32	2:24:39	g	maybe like
2:32:38	2:32:46	g	are IY anywhere near there 
2:35:19	2:35:19	f	around the top of the lake 
2:42:26	2:42:29	g	around the bottom of it
2:43:36	2:43:43	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
2:44:45	2:44:51	f	ok
2:45:54	2:45:55	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
2:46:12	2:46:18	f	IY know IY have different things so
2:47:14	2:47:22	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
2:47:35	2:47:40	g	what 
2:48:1	2:48:8	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
2:48:31	2:48:32	g	and then
2:49:1	2:49:4	g	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
2:49:3	2:49:6	g	and IY re sloping to the left
2:51:7	2:51:12	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
2:51:35	2:51:37	f	yeah 
2:52:3	2:52:7	g	and
2:52:59	2:53:8	f	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
2:53:16	2:53:25	g	ok
2:55:3	2:55:10	g	uhm
2:58:12	2:58:18	g	probably the same thing
2:58:33	2:58:40	g	after plane crash
2:58:33	2:58:41	g	to the right
2:58:33	2:58:41	f	ok
2:58:42	2:58:42	f	ok
2:58:55	2:59:3	g	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
3:0:17	3:0:20	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
3:1:7	3:1:11	g	just do it like this ok
3:1:9	3:1:17	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
3:2:30	3:2:38	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
3:3:47	3:3:54	g	and there s a plane crash
3:4:25	3:4:31	g	no IY have  
3:5:26	3:5:33	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
3:5:53	3:5:56	f	mm hmm
3:6:3	3:6:10	g	are IY in like   
3:6:21	3:6:21	f	to the left
3:7:9	3:7:12	f	yeah
3:7:13	3:7:20	f	ok
3:8:38	3:8:42	g	an inch maybe a little bit less

3:14:16	3:14:23	g	to the left
3:14:25	3:14:28	g	IY re sloping
3:16:22	3:16:24	f	and curve down to the left 
3:18:19	3:18:22	f	mm hmm
3:19:7	3:19:16	f	ok
3:20:21	3:20:23	f	yeah
3:21:11	3:21:14	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
3:22:37	3:22:46	g	IY would say
3:23:55	3:24:1	g	well alright
3:24:11	3:24:13	g	uhm

3:28:30	3:28:30	g	and 
3:29:39	3:29:42	g	for about two inches
3:29:46	3:29:47	g	so IY re at the hot springs
3:30:25	3:30:31	g	like IY re sloping
3:30:39	3:30:45	g	you
3:32:28	3:32:28	f	ok
3:32:56	3:32:56	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
3:34:13	3:34:14	g	IY go straight down
3:34:12	3:34:21	f	how many inches do IY think 
3:35:11	3:35:15	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
3:36:1	3:36:6	g	uhm
3:36:37	3:36:45	g	ok well
3:37:43	3:37:43	g	maybe four inches on the paper
3:39:25	3:39:28	g	IY don t know
3:41:35	3:41:39	g	and then
3:42:20	3:42:24	g	like maybe an inch
3:42:58	3:42:59	f	IY m three inches above the savannah
3:43:9	3:43:12	g	well
3:43:23	3:43:29	g	like
3:45:27	3:45:33	g	IY re starting

3:47:25	3:47:26	f	ok
3:47:28	3:47:34	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right
3:47:47	3:47:47	g	and IY re going straight up
3:48:24	3:48:29	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
3:50:29	3:50:32	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
3:50:43	3:50:43	g	that s IY little slope
3:51:22	3:51:24	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
3:51:43	3:51:45	g	and then IY slope
3:52:34	3:52:38	g	so
3:52:45	3:52:52	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
3:54:22	3:54:29	g	uhm
3:58:15	3:58:21	f	uhm my
4:0:18	4:0:20	g	five
4:3:18	4:3:24	g	they re there
4:3:46	4:3:50	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
4:3:51	4:3:51	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
4:5:17	4:5:26	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
4:5:27	4:5:29	g	and IY just go straight up
4:5:46	4:5:53	g	so anyway
4:8:31	4:8:34	f	ok
4:8:26	4:8:35	g	from
4:9:37	4:9:40	g	ok
4:10:8	4:10:16	f	mm hmm
4:10:38	4:10:42	f	IY ve a plane crash though
4:11:43	4:11:46	f	ok
4:12:8	4:12:15	g	like
4:12:14	4:12:17	f	yeah IY see that

4:17:11	4:17:16	f	ok
4:17:31	4:17:31	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
4:18:36	4:18:37	f	ok
4:19:24	4:19:30	f	mm  mm
4:20:22	4:20:26	g	uhm
4:21:26	4:21:27	g	ok
4:23:29	4:23:32	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
4:23:57	4:23:59	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
4:26:55	4:27:4	g	but
4:29:0	4:29:7	g	IY re actually starting like right
4:29:43	4:29:51	g	ok
4:30:48	4:30:54	g	like
4:33:49	4:33:51	f	elephants 
4:35:13	4:35:16	g	ok
4:36:10	4:36:15	f	ok
4:36:24	4:36:28	g	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
4:39:38	4:39:47	g	maybe
4:41:55	4:42:1	g	to the left
4:42:41	4:42:42	f	yeah
4:46:21	4:46:30	g	and then
4:47:13	4:47:14	g	no IY don t have any rocks
4:48:8	4:48:9	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
4:48:18	4:48:18	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
4:48:59	4:49:0	f	ok
4:49:0	4:49:2	g	ok
4:49:6	4:49:12	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
4:49:53	4:49:55	f	ok
4:52:5	4:52:10	g	uhm
4:52:38	4:52:47	f	to the right 
4:53:42	4:53:44	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
4:53:51	4:53:57	f	do IY go around it 
4:55:9	4:55:14	g	yes
4:57:55	4:57:59	g	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
5:1:31	5:1:33	g	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
5:2:11	5:2:13	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
5:2:38	5:2:39	g	alright 
5:2:49	5:2:52	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
5:7:44	5:7:46	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
5:9:19	5:9:28	f	ok
5:9:25	5:9:33	g	and then
5:11:26	5:11:29	g	to IY right 
5:13:14	5:13:18	g	not right at the stony desert
5:16:37	5:16:38	f	ok wait hold on
5:16:34	5:16:43	g	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
5:17:53	5:17:59	g	and then IY go
5:19:1	5:19:5	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
5:19:54	5:20:2	f	yeah and IY went straight up
5:21:22	5:21:23	g	IY just kind of slope down
5:22:37	5:22:38	g	ok
5:23:15	5:23:24	g	ok
5:23:21	5:23:26	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
5:23:36	5:23:36	g	and then IY  IY go up
5:24:56	5:25:0	g	uhm
5:25:25	5:25:28	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
5:25:35	5:25:38	g	there s a there s  
5:27:21	5:27:23	g	uhm
5:27:38	5:27:40	g	and IY re going
5:28:25	5:28:28	g	uhm
5:29:37	5:29:37	g	ok
5:29:34	5:29:40	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
5:31:3	5:31:7	f	ok
5:31:24	5:31:31	f	ok
5:31:44	5:31:44	g	and then IY slope down to the left
5:35:3	5:35:8	g	and then IY are
5:35:45	5:35:47	g	after the circle
5:35:55	5:35:59	g	four or five inches to the left
5:37:15	5:37:24	g	no there s no elephants
5:37:27	5:37:30	g	no IY don t have a waterhole
5:37:54	5:37:56	g	uhm
5:38:14	5:38:18	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
5:39:15	5:39:23	g	and then
5:40:34	5:40:34	g	three inches
5:41:12	5:41:15	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
5:41:42	5:41:51	g	are IY  
5:41:58	5:42:6	g	it s right next to it
5:42:19	5:42:26	g	ok
5:43:11	5:43:14	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
5:43:25	5:43:26	g	maybe IY have different things
5:43:31	5:43:31	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
5:43:35	5:43:42	g	just a slight slope
5:43:58	5:44:0	g	ok
5:44:29	5:44:38	g	ok
5:45:18	5:45:23	g	after that IY go straight again
5:47:27	5:47:35	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
5:48:39	5:48:41	g	like an inch
5:48:39	5:48:47	f	mm hmm
5:49:21	5:49:26	g	ok
5:49:26	5:49:32	g	do IY have roman baths
