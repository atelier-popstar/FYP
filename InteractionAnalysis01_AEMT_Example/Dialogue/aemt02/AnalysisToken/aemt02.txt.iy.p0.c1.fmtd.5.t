4	0:4:42	0:4:46	IY re going about
5	0:7:8	0:7:9	that s about five or six inches
6	0:7:20	0:7:20	like three inches 
7	0:7:32	0:7:32	and then
9	0:8:18	0:8:24	after IY slope down IY d say
11	0:11:2	0:11:3	ok
12	0:13:40	0:13:41	ok
14	0:15:30	0:15:33	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
15	0:16:38	0:16:45	couple miles or something
16	0:17:45	0:17:50	and then IY  IY go up
18	0:18:4	0:18:12	no IY have  
19	0:20:53	0:21:1	ok
20	0:20:54	0:21:2	IY got that 
21	0:21:30	0:21:37	for like
22	0:22:35	0:22:38	IY re actually starting like right
24	0:25:25	0:25:32	not right at the stony desert
25	0:25:35	0:25:39	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
26	0:26:7	0:26:7	maybe like
28	0:26:16	0:26:21	are IY in like almost the top of the
29	0:30:30	0:30:36	so IY go three inches straight
30	0:30:30	0:30:39	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
31	0:30:53	0:30:58	ok well
32	0:32:19	0:32:28	ok
35	0:33:26	0:33:33	and then IY slope up
37	0:37:19	0:37:27	uhm
38	0:37:48	0:37:57	uhm
40	0:38:19	0:38:26	that s IY little slope
41	0:38:21	0:38:26	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
42	0:38:24	0:38:31	well just
44	0:39:16	0:39:22	so
45	0:39:32	0:39:39	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
47	0:40:34	0:40:43	straight up
48	0:40:42	0:40:51	and then
49	0:41:51	0:41:56	to the right
51	0:44:9	0:44:17	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
52	0:44:17	0:44:25	uhm
53	0:44:55	0:45:1	are IY  
54	0:47:5	0:47:14	so IY make that circle
55	0:47:14	0:47:15	ok
56	0:49:41	0:49:50	uhm
57	0:49:52	0:50:1	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
59	0:50:32	0:50:38	and is to the left
60	0:50:41	0:50:41	for about two inches
61	0:51:18	0:51:18	and IY go to the left a little bit
63	0:57:57	0:58:4	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
64	0:58:18	0:58:20	a little bit too
65	0:59:8	0:59:9	uhm
66	0:59:28	0:59:29	and then
69	1:1:24	1:1:33	and it slopes a little bit to the right
70	1:2:9	1:2:12	IY don t know
71	1:5:17	1:5:19	and
72	1:8:37	1:8:44	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
73	1:11:26	1:11:28	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
74	1:12:20	1:12:22	couple inches IY re sloping down
76	1:13:9	1:13:18	uhm and there is a stony desert
77	1:13:47	1:13:52	three inches
79	1:16:41	1:16:43	ok
83	1:21:27	1:21:34	like
84	1:22:58	1:23:6	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
85	1:23:20	1:23:28	from
87	1:26:50	1:26:53	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
88	1:26:57	1:27:2	and then IY go straight
90	1:29:7	1:29:16	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
91	1:29:15	1:29:22	like
92	1:29:18	1:29:27	IY re sloping
93	1:30:14	1:30:17	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
94	1:30:26	1:30:34	uhm
95	1:32:41	1:32:50	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
97	1:35:34	1:35:40	ok
98	1:36:55	1:36:59	and then IY go
99	1:37:28	1:37:29	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
100	1:39:58	1:40:6	ok
101	1:43:38	1:43:43	uhm
102	1:46:34	1:46:36	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
106	1:51:41	1:51:44	to the left
108	1:54:12	1:54:13	ok IY re at the savannah
109	1:58:45	1:58:48	IY wanna kind of curve
110	2:1:5	2:1:11	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
111	2:2:2	2:2:11	IY would say
112	2:4:52	2:4:56	uhm
114	2:7:54	2:8:3	and IY re sloping to the left
118	2:10:14	2:10:21	and that s where the plane crash is
120	2:12:21	2:12:30	IY make
122	2:13:34	2:13:37	uhm
123	2:13:34	2:13:42	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
124	2:14:5	2:14:14	and IY should have a straight line there
125	2:15:56	2:16:0	IY re starting at the stony desert
126	2:15:59	2:16:1	and 
127	2:16:43	2:16:47	ok 
128	2:18:30	2:18:38	ok
129	2:18:33	2:18:42	and
130	2:18:46	2:18:50	and then IY slope
134	2:22:34	2:22:42	IY plane crash 
135	2:28:22	2:28:31	ok
136	2:29:2	2:29:5	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
137	2:30:24	2:30:33	IY go straight down
138	2:33:2	2:33:2	three inches straight across
142	2:35:25	2:35:32	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
143	2:36:40	2:36:45	IY move to the left
145	2:39:17	2:39:26	a little
146	2:40:4	2:40:12	to IY right 
148	2:40:40	2:40:46	like four or five inches to the left
149	2:44:31	2:44:37	about like
150	2:45:15	2:45:23	and IY re going
151	2:45:28	2:45:35	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
152	2:47:26	2:47:31	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
154	2:48:36	2:48:45	and IY go down IY slope to the right
156	2:50:5	2:50:10	where IY re going down to a plane crash
158	2:53:12	2:53:13	ok and then IY re going
161	3:4:1	3:4:6	ok well
162	3:4:30	3:4:33	to the lake 
163	3:8:9	3:8:11	on IY sheet anyway
164	3:10:33	3:10:36	and then IY ll come to a savannah
165	3:10:52	3:10:59	uhm
167	3:13:10	3:13:17	so anyway
168	3:14:2	3:14:8	well
170	3:15:45	3:15:48	for like
171	3:17:43	3:17:47	and IY slope is about an inch long
172	3:19:11	3:19:14	uhm
173	3:20:36	3:20:42	uhm
174	3:23:7	3:23:15	IY re going like
176	3:24:56	3:24:57	IY re just going down
177	3:25:37	3:25:46	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
178	3:26:2	3:26:2	and there s a plane crash
179	3:27:2	3:27:8	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
180	3:27:28	3:27:36	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
181	3:27:36	3:27:37	yes
182	3:30:32	3:30:38	are IY anywhere near there 
183	3:31:58	3:31:59	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
184	3:32:49	3:32:51	like IY re sloping
186	3:36:32	3:36:34	alright 
187	3:38:4	3:38:8	after plane crash
188	3:38:20	3:38:23	to the white mountain
190	3:40:13	3:40:20	ok
192	3:43:18	3:43:20	ok
194	3:47:33	3:47:38	just do it like this ok
195	3:48:10	3:48:17	then
196	3:49:44	3:49:45	after that IY go straight again
197	3:50:11	3:50:17	uhm
198	3:51:10	3:51:11	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
200	3:54:55	3:55:4	and then
201	3:55:45	3:55:52	the slate mountain is towards the right
202	3:57:36	3:57:43	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
204	3:59:37	3:59:44	to the left
205	4:0:7	4:0:12	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
207	4:7:11	4:7:11	probably the same thing
208	4:7:35	4:7:35	it s right next to it
209	4:9:30	4:9:33	what 
210	4:9:31	4:9:38	like
211	4:9:56	4:10:4	so IY re at the hot springs
212	4:12:30	4:12:32	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
213	4:12:43	4:12:45	ok
214	4:14:34	4:14:38	three inches
215	4:15:13	4:15:13	ok
216	4:15:43	4:15:51	ok
218	4:19:15	4:19:17	uh like
220	4:20:4	4:20:13	ok
222	4:21:19	4:21:19	five
223	4:21:56	4:22:5	after the circle
224	4:22:25	4:22:26	slight
225	4:22:46	4:22:51	uhhh no
226	4:23:39	4:23:47	is the plane crash  
227	4:23:52	4:23:54	no
228	4:26:5	4:26:12	like
229	4:27:57	4:27:59	and IY just go straight up
230	4:28:2	4:28:8	and then IY are
231	4:28:56	4:28:56	IY slope down again
232	4:30:16	4:30:22	are IY in like   
233	4:33:15	4:33:24	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
236	4:38:32	4:38:32	maybe like
237	4:40:49	4:40:51	do IY have roman baths 
238	4:40:58	4:41:4	maybe four inches on the paper
239	4:41:15	4:41:19	around the bottom of it
240	4:41:20	4:41:27	IY re at the plane crash
241	4:44:38	4:44:46	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
242	4:45:29	4:45:32	just a slight slope
243	4:45:44	4:45:51	go up like three  three and a half inches
244	4:45:58	4:45:58	and then IY slope down to the left
245	4:46:1	4:46:1	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
247	4:48:7	4:48:13	uhm
248	4:51:30	4:51:37	well
249	4:52:11	4:52:15	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
250	4:52:36	4:52:44	ok
251	4:53:8	4:53:9	and then
254	4:54:16	4:54:24	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
255	4:56:11	4:56:12	like maybe an inch
256	4:58:19	4:58:22	but
259	5:0:37	5:0:44	and then
260	5:1:46	5:1:47	IY just kind of slope down
261	5:2:27	5:2:29	maybe
262	5:2:35	5:2:36	they re there
263	5:2:42	5:2:48	ok IY plane crash isn t there
265	5:3:21	5:3:27	maybe IY have different things
266	5:6:10	5:6:12	IY re kind of going  
270	5:12:4	5:12:9	a quarter of an inch
271	5:14:54	5:14:59	kind of across from stony desert
273	5:16:25	5:16:28	ok
275	5:17:55	5:18:3	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
276	5:21:17	5:21:19	and IY re going up like
278	5:23:0	5:23:4	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
279	5:24:39	5:24:41	and then
280	5:26:37	5:26:39	IY re starting
282	5:29:4	5:29:4	the  
284	5:32:31	5:32:40	alright well IY ll keep going and see
285	5:35:44	5:35:48	what 
286	5:35:44	5:35:53	an inch maybe a little bit less
287	5:36:12	5:36:12	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
288	5:36:30	5:36:31	four or five inches to the left
289	5:38:13	5:38:20	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
290	5:40:11	5:40:14	and IY re going straight up
291	5:40:30	5:40:38	so that s about IY would say
292	5:41:34	5:41:42	ok
294	5:46:3	5:46:10	uhm
295	5:47:13	5:47:13	hmm
296	5:48:19	5:48:24	no there s no elephants
298	5:52:56	5:53:3	it s not a big curve
299	5:53:11	5:53:11	alright are IY starting  near the  
300	5:53:22	5:53:23	like an inch
301	5:54:5	5:54:7	and 
302	5:54:26	5:54:31	ok
305	5:57:2	5:57:5	ok
306	5:57:39	5:57:44	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
307	5:59:20	5:59:24	ok
309	5:59:51	6:0:0	and then IY re going down
310	6:0:14	6:0:19	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
311	6:2:58	6:2:58	yes
312	6:3:9	6:3:10	no IY don t have a waterhole
313	6:5:40	6:5:44	yes IY re going towards the lake
315	6:6:1	6:6:1	uhm
316	6:6:23	6:6:24	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
317	6:8:7	6:8:11	alright 
318	6:8:51	6:8:58	alright alright well just
322	6:14:0	6:14:2	you
323	6:14:10	6:14:12	have a s 
324	6:14:24	6:14:25	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
325	6:14:25	6:14:32	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
326	6:16:55	6:16:58	ok
327	6:17:31	6:17:37	no
328	6:20:32	6:20:37	there s a there s  
330	6:23:29	6:23:34	are IY anywere near there 
332	6:25:0	6:25:4	ok
334	6:25:46	6:25:55	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
335	6:26:3	6:26:9	no IY don t have any rocks
336	6:28:30	6:28:37	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
337	6:30:14	6:30:19	to the left
338	6:31:15	6:31:16	uhm
339	6:32:43	6:32:43	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
340	6:33:37	6:33:46	and then
341	6:33:56	6:33:58	well alright
start f
0	0:0:42	0:0:49	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
1	0:1:41	0:1:42	mm  mm
2	0:3:46	0:3:54	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
3	0:4:27	0:4:36	ok
8	0:7:59	0:8:6	ok
10	0:8:31	0:8:38	nope IY have a white mountain
13	0:14:26	0:14:33	and then what 
17	0:18:8	0:18:10	IY hit some round rocks
23	0:22:57	0:23:5	yeah and IY went straight up
27	0:26:11	0:26:12	 IY m at the savannah
33	0:32:41	0:32:41	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
34	0:33:25	0:33:27	to the left of the antelope
36	0:33:55	0:34:2	up tp the right
39	0:38:7	0:38:11	so wait
43	0:39:10	0:39:13	mm hmm
46	0:40:40	0:40:40	and
50	0:42:21	0:42:22	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
58	0:50:26	0:50:32	around the top of the lake 
62	0:55:29	0:55:32	mm hmm
67	1:0:1	1:0:5	ok
68	1:1:20	1:1:20	yeah 
75	1:13:13	1:13:18	ok
78	1:15:35	1:15:41	how many inches do IY think 
80	1:17:21	1:17:21	ok
81	1:17:23	1:17:26	ok
82	1:18:50	1:18:50	and there s a collapsed shelter
86	1:24:1	1:24:1	ok
89	1:27:43	1:27:48	and to the right 
96	1:35:21	1:35:30	IY have to back up a little bit
103	1:48:54	1:48:58	elephants 
104	1:48:54	1:48:59	yeah
105	1:50:33	1:50:34	yeah
107	1:52:13	1:52:13	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
113	2:6:26	2:6:26	and curve down to the left 
115	2:8:8	2:8:9	ok
116	2:8:26	2:8:29	IY hit some rocks though
117	2:9:11	2:9:15	to the left
119	2:11:40	2:11:42	ok
121	2:12:48	2:12:49	ok
131	2:20:15	2:20:17	so IY pass a waterhole or no

133	2:21:5	2:21:10	ok
139	2:34:37	2:34:45	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
140	2:34:49	2:34:53	ok
141	2:35:22	2:35:22	do IY go by the plane crash 
144	2:37:57	2:38:4	ok
147	2:40:27	2:40:27	ok
153	2:47:44	2:47:47	yeah

159	2:55:54	2:56:1	yeah
160	3:1:2	3:1:9	so IY go to the left of the antelope

191	3:43:8	3:43:15	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
193	3:43:34	3:43:35	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
199	3:52:46	3:52:54	ok
203	3:59:7	3:59:10	mm hmm
206	4:2:44	4:2:44	ok

221	4:20:20	4:20:22	IY know IY have different things so
234	4:36:48	4:36:52	do IY go around it 
235	4:37:24	4:37:28	IY ve a plane crash though
246	4:46:40	4:46:47	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
252	4:53:16	4:53:20	ok
253	4:53:58	4:54:6	ok
257	4:59:44	4:59:53	around the lake to the top 
258	5:0:23	5:0:31	IY go to a lake 
264	5:2:49	5:2:56	do IY go through anything 
267	5:9:2	5:9:7	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
268	5:9:12	5:9:15	uh IY don t know know what to say
269	5:9:45	5:9:54	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
272	5:16:11	5:16:11	yep
274	5:17:11	5:17:19	ok
277	5:22:23	5:22:26	ok
281	5:27:49	5:27:56	IY m three inches above the savannah
283	5:30:41	5:30:42	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
293	5:42:58	5:43:0	oh
297	5:50:43	5:50:47	mm hmm
303	5:55:40	5:55:43	yeah IY see that

308	5:59:47	5:59:55	ok
314	6:5:44	6:5:45	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
319	6:11:44	6:11:51	ok wait hold on
320	6:12:8	6:12:13	yeah
321	6:13:46	6:13:55	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
329	6:22:16	6:22:16	uhm my
331	6:23:35	6:23:38	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
333	6:25:46	6:25:49	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
342	6:34:18	6:34:21	ok
start g
4	0:4:42	0:4:46	IY re going about
5	0:7:8	0:7:9	that s about five or six inches
6	0:7:20	0:7:20	like three inches 
7	0:7:32	0:7:32	and then
9	0:8:18	0:8:24	after IY slope down IY d say
11	0:11:2	0:11:3	ok
12	0:13:40	0:13:41	ok
14	0:15:30	0:15:33	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
15	0:16:38	0:16:45	couple miles or something
16	0:17:45	0:17:50	and then IY  IY go up
18	0:18:4	0:18:12	no IY have  
19	0:20:53	0:21:1	ok
20	0:20:54	0:21:2	IY got that 
21	0:21:30	0:21:37	for like
22	0:22:35	0:22:38	IY re actually starting like right
24	0:25:25	0:25:32	not right at the stony desert
25	0:25:35	0:25:39	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
26	0:26:7	0:26:7	maybe like
28	0:26:16	0:26:21	are IY in like almost the top of the
29	0:30:30	0:30:36	so IY go three inches straight
30	0:30:30	0:30:39	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
31	0:30:53	0:30:58	ok well
32	0:32:19	0:32:28	ok
35	0:33:26	0:33:33	and then IY slope up
37	0:37:19	0:37:27	uhm
38	0:37:48	0:37:57	uhm
40	0:38:19	0:38:26	that s IY little slope
41	0:38:21	0:38:26	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
42	0:38:24	0:38:31	well just
44	0:39:16	0:39:22	so
45	0:39:32	0:39:39	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
47	0:40:34	0:40:43	straight up
48	0:40:42	0:40:51	and then
49	0:41:51	0:41:56	to the right
51	0:44:9	0:44:17	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
52	0:44:17	0:44:25	uhm
53	0:44:55	0:45:1	are IY  
54	0:47:5	0:47:14	so IY make that circle
55	0:47:14	0:47:15	ok
56	0:49:41	0:49:50	uhm
57	0:49:52	0:50:1	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
59	0:50:32	0:50:38	and is to the left
60	0:50:41	0:50:41	for about two inches
61	0:51:18	0:51:18	and IY go to the left a little bit
63	0:57:57	0:58:4	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
64	0:58:18	0:58:20	a little bit too
65	0:59:8	0:59:9	uhm
66	0:59:28	0:59:29	and then
69	1:1:24	1:1:33	and it slopes a little bit to the right
70	1:2:9	1:2:12	IY don t know
71	1:5:17	1:5:19	and
72	1:8:37	1:8:44	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
73	1:11:26	1:11:28	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
74	1:12:20	1:12:22	couple inches IY re sloping down
76	1:13:9	1:13:18	uhm and there is a stony desert
77	1:13:47	1:13:52	three inches
79	1:16:41	1:16:43	ok
83	1:21:27	1:21:34	like
84	1:22:58	1:23:6	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
85	1:23:20	1:23:28	from
87	1:26:50	1:26:53	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
88	1:26:57	1:27:2	and then IY go straight
90	1:29:7	1:29:16	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
91	1:29:15	1:29:22	like
92	1:29:18	1:29:27	IY re sloping
93	1:30:14	1:30:17	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
94	1:30:26	1:30:34	uhm
95	1:32:41	1:32:50	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
97	1:35:34	1:35:40	ok
98	1:36:55	1:36:59	and then IY go
99	1:37:28	1:37:29	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
100	1:39:58	1:40:6	ok
101	1:43:38	1:43:43	uhm
102	1:46:34	1:46:36	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
106	1:51:41	1:51:44	to the left
108	1:54:12	1:54:13	ok IY re at the savannah
109	1:58:45	1:58:48	IY wanna kind of curve
110	2:1:5	2:1:11	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
111	2:2:2	2:2:11	IY would say
112	2:4:52	2:4:56	uhm
114	2:7:54	2:8:3	and IY re sloping to the left
118	2:10:14	2:10:21	and that s where the plane crash is
120	2:12:21	2:12:30	IY make
122	2:13:34	2:13:37	uhm
123	2:13:34	2:13:42	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
124	2:14:5	2:14:14	and IY should have a straight line there
125	2:15:56	2:16:0	IY re starting at the stony desert
126	2:15:59	2:16:1	and 
127	2:16:43	2:16:47	ok 
128	2:18:30	2:18:38	ok
129	2:18:33	2:18:42	and
130	2:18:46	2:18:50	and then IY slope
134	2:22:34	2:22:42	IY plane crash 
135	2:28:22	2:28:31	ok
136	2:29:2	2:29:5	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
137	2:30:24	2:30:33	IY go straight down
138	2:33:2	2:33:2	three inches straight across
142	2:35:25	2:35:32	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
143	2:36:40	2:36:45	IY move to the left
145	2:39:17	2:39:26	a little
146	2:40:4	2:40:12	to IY right 
148	2:40:40	2:40:46	like four or five inches to the left
149	2:44:31	2:44:37	about like
150	2:45:15	2:45:23	and IY re going
151	2:45:28	2:45:35	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
152	2:47:26	2:47:31	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
154	2:48:36	2:48:45	and IY go down IY slope to the right
156	2:50:5	2:50:10	where IY re going down to a plane crash
158	2:53:12	2:53:13	ok and then IY re going
161	3:4:1	3:4:6	ok well
162	3:4:30	3:4:33	to the lake 
163	3:8:9	3:8:11	on IY sheet anyway
164	3:10:33	3:10:36	and then IY ll come to a savannah
165	3:10:52	3:10:59	uhm
167	3:13:10	3:13:17	so anyway
168	3:14:2	3:14:8	well
170	3:15:45	3:15:48	for like
171	3:17:43	3:17:47	and IY slope is about an inch long
172	3:19:11	3:19:14	uhm
173	3:20:36	3:20:42	uhm
174	3:23:7	3:23:15	IY re going like
176	3:24:56	3:24:57	IY re just going down
177	3:25:37	3:25:46	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
178	3:26:2	3:26:2	and there s a plane crash
179	3:27:2	3:27:8	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
180	3:27:28	3:27:36	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
181	3:27:36	3:27:37	yes
182	3:30:32	3:30:38	are IY anywhere near there 
183	3:31:58	3:31:59	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
184	3:32:49	3:32:51	like IY re sloping
186	3:36:32	3:36:34	alright 
187	3:38:4	3:38:8	after plane crash
188	3:38:20	3:38:23	to the white mountain
190	3:40:13	3:40:20	ok
192	3:43:18	3:43:20	ok
194	3:47:33	3:47:38	just do it like this ok
195	3:48:10	3:48:17	then
196	3:49:44	3:49:45	after that IY go straight again
197	3:50:11	3:50:17	uhm
198	3:51:10	3:51:11	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
200	3:54:55	3:55:4	and then
201	3:55:45	3:55:52	the slate mountain is towards the right
202	3:57:36	3:57:43	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
204	3:59:37	3:59:44	to the left
205	4:0:7	4:0:12	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
207	4:7:11	4:7:11	probably the same thing
208	4:7:35	4:7:35	it s right next to it
209	4:9:30	4:9:33	what 
210	4:9:31	4:9:38	like
211	4:9:56	4:10:4	so IY re at the hot springs
212	4:12:30	4:12:32	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
213	4:12:43	4:12:45	ok
214	4:14:34	4:14:38	three inches
215	4:15:13	4:15:13	ok
216	4:15:43	4:15:51	ok
218	4:19:15	4:19:17	uh like
220	4:20:4	4:20:13	ok
222	4:21:19	4:21:19	five
223	4:21:56	4:22:5	after the circle
224	4:22:25	4:22:26	slight
225	4:22:46	4:22:51	uhhh no
226	4:23:39	4:23:47	is the plane crash  
227	4:23:52	4:23:54	no
228	4:26:5	4:26:12	like
229	4:27:57	4:27:59	and IY just go straight up
230	4:28:2	4:28:8	and then IY are
231	4:28:56	4:28:56	IY slope down again
232	4:30:16	4:30:22	are IY in like   
233	4:33:15	4:33:24	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
236	4:38:32	4:38:32	maybe like
237	4:40:49	4:40:51	do IY have roman baths 
238	4:40:58	4:41:4	maybe four inches on the paper
239	4:41:15	4:41:19	around the bottom of it
240	4:41:20	4:41:27	IY re at the plane crash
241	4:44:38	4:44:46	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
242	4:45:29	4:45:32	just a slight slope
243	4:45:44	4:45:51	go up like three  three and a half inches
244	4:45:58	4:45:58	and then IY slope down to the left
245	4:46:1	4:46:1	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
247	4:48:7	4:48:13	uhm
248	4:51:30	4:51:37	well
249	4:52:11	4:52:15	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
250	4:52:36	4:52:44	ok
251	4:53:8	4:53:9	and then
254	4:54:16	4:54:24	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
255	4:56:11	4:56:12	like maybe an inch
256	4:58:19	4:58:22	but
259	5:0:37	5:0:44	and then
260	5:1:46	5:1:47	IY just kind of slope down
261	5:2:27	5:2:29	maybe
262	5:2:35	5:2:36	they re there
263	5:2:42	5:2:48	ok IY plane crash isn t there
265	5:3:21	5:3:27	maybe IY have different things
266	5:6:10	5:6:12	IY re kind of going  
270	5:12:4	5:12:9	a quarter of an inch
271	5:14:54	5:14:59	kind of across from stony desert
273	5:16:25	5:16:28	ok
275	5:17:55	5:18:3	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
276	5:21:17	5:21:19	and IY re going up like
278	5:23:0	5:23:4	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
279	5:24:39	5:24:41	and then
280	5:26:37	5:26:39	IY re starting
282	5:29:4	5:29:4	the  
284	5:32:31	5:32:40	alright well IY ll keep going and see
285	5:35:44	5:35:48	what 
286	5:35:44	5:35:53	an inch maybe a little bit less
287	5:36:12	5:36:12	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
288	5:36:30	5:36:31	four or five inches to the left
289	5:38:13	5:38:20	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
290	5:40:11	5:40:14	and IY re going straight up
291	5:40:30	5:40:38	so that s about IY would say
292	5:41:34	5:41:42	ok
294	5:46:3	5:46:10	uhm
295	5:47:13	5:47:13	hmm
296	5:48:19	5:48:24	no there s no elephants
298	5:52:56	5:53:3	it s not a big curve
299	5:53:11	5:53:11	alright are IY starting  near the  
300	5:53:22	5:53:23	like an inch
301	5:54:5	5:54:7	and 
302	5:54:26	5:54:31	ok
305	5:57:2	5:57:5	ok
306	5:57:39	5:57:44	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
307	5:59:20	5:59:24	ok
309	5:59:51	6:0:0	and then IY re going down
310	6:0:14	6:0:19	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
311	6:2:58	6:2:58	yes
312	6:3:9	6:3:10	no IY don t have a waterhole
313	6:5:40	6:5:44	yes IY re going towards the lake
315	6:6:1	6:6:1	uhm
316	6:6:23	6:6:24	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
317	6:8:7	6:8:11	alright 
318	6:8:51	6:8:58	alright alright well just
322	6:14:0	6:14:2	you
