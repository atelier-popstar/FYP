0:0:42	0:0:49	f	265	49			IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
0:1:41	0:1:42	f	331	102			mm  mm
0:3:46	0:3:54	f	174	234			IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
0:4:27	0:4:36	f	236	276			ok
0:4:42	0:4:46	g	282	286			IY re going about
0:7:8	0:7:9	g	337	429			that s about five or six inches
0:7:20	0:7:20	g	152	440			like three inches 
0:7:32	0:7:32	g	20	452			and then
0:7:59	0:8:6	f	124	486			ok
0:8:18	0:8:24	g	127	504			after IY slope down IY d say
0:8:31	0:8:38	f	188	518			nope IY have a white mountain
0:11:2	0:11:3	g	172	663			ok
0:13:40	0:13:41	g	180	821			ok
0:14:26	0:14:33	f	109	873			and then what 
0:15:30	0:15:33	g	195	933			IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
0:16:38	0:16:45	g	210	1005			couple miles or something
0:17:45	0:17:50	g	211	1070			and then IY  IY go up
0:18:8	0:18:10	f	88	1090			IY hit some round rocks
0:18:4	0:18:12	g	21	1092			no IY have  
0:20:53	0:21:1	g	3	1261			ok
0:20:54	0:21:2	g	179	1262			IY got that 
0:21:30	0:21:37	g	273	1297			for like
0:22:35	0:22:38	g	40	1358			IY re actually starting like right
0:22:57	0:23:5	f	300	1385			yeah and IY went straight up
0:25:25	0:25:32	g	286	1532			not right at the stony desert
0:25:35	0:25:39	g	110	1539			now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
0:26:7	0:26:7	g	271	1567			maybe like
0:26:11	0:26:12	f	35	1572			 IY m at the savannah
0:26:16	0:26:21	g	106	1581			are IY in like almost the top of the
0:30:30	0:30:36	g	240	1836			so IY go three inches straight
0:30:30	0:30:39	g	37	1839			yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
0:30:53	0:30:58	g	324	1858			ok well
0:32:19	0:32:28	g	215	1948			ok
0:32:41	0:32:41	f	264	1961			no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
0:33:25	0:33:27	f	190	2007			to the left of the antelope
0:33:26	0:33:33	g	27	2013			and then IY slope up
0:33:55	0:34:2	f	95	2042			up tp the right
0:37:19	0:37:27	g	43	2247			uhm
0:37:48	0:37:57	g	137	2277			uhm
0:38:7	0:38:11	f	299	2291			so wait
0:38:19	0:38:26	g	312	2306			that s IY little slope
0:38:21	0:38:26	g	325	2306			maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
0:38:24	0:38:31	g	268	2311			well just
0:39:10	0:39:13	f	147	2353			mm hmm
0:39:16	0:39:22	g	99	2362			so
0:39:32	0:39:39	g	241	2379			and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
0:40:40	0:40:40	f	94	2440			and
0:40:34	0:40:43	g	226	2443			straight up
0:40:42	0:40:51	g	77	2451			and then
0:41:51	0:41:56	g	165	2516			to the right
0:42:21	0:42:22	f	167	2542			do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
0:44:9	0:44:17	g	262	2657			and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
0:44:17	0:44:25	g	181	2665			uhm
0:44:55	0:45:1	g	79	2701			are IY  
0:47:5	0:47:14	g	141	2834			so IY make that circle
0:47:14	0:47:15	g	212	2835			ok
0:49:41	0:49:50	g	253	2990			uhm
0:49:52	0:50:1	g	267	3001			IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
0:50:26	0:50:32	f	65	3032			around the top of the lake 
0:50:32	0:50:38	g	219	3038			and is to the left
0:50:41	0:50:41	g	113	3041			for about two inches
0:51:18	0:51:18	g	320	3078			and IY go to the left a little bit
0:55:29	0:55:32	f	139	3332			mm hmm
0:57:57	0:58:4	g	216	3484			and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
0:58:18	0:58:20	g	233	3500			a little bit too
0:59:8	0:59:9	g	225	3549			uhm
0:59:28	0:59:29	g	244	3569			and then
1:0:1	1:0:5	f	177	3605			ok
1:1:20	1:1:20	f	161	3680			yeah 
1:1:24	1:1:33	g	201	3693			and it slopes a little bit to the right
1:2:9	1:2:12	g	89	3732			IY don t know
1:5:17	1:5:19	g	290	3919			and
1:8:37	1:8:44	g	301	4124			so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
1:11:26	1:11:28	g	69	4288			to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
1:12:20	1:12:22	g	317	4342			couple inches IY re sloping down
1:13:13	1:13:18	f	162	4398			ok
1:13:9	1:13:18	g	160	4398			uhm and there is a stony desert
1:13:47	1:13:52	g	178	4432			three inches
1:15:35	1:15:41	f	5	4541			how many inches do IY think 
1:16:41	1:16:43	g	221	4603			ok
1:17:21	1:17:21	f	250	4641			ok
1:17:23	1:17:26	f	191	4646			ok
1:18:50	1:18:50	f	55	4730			and there s a collapsed shelter
1:21:27	1:21:34	g	314	4894			like
1:22:58	1:23:6	g	308	4986			yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
1:23:20	1:23:28	g	145	5008			from
1:24:1	1:24:1	f	232	5041			ok
1:26:50	1:26:53	g	247	5213			IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
1:26:57	1:27:2	g	18	5222			and then IY go straight
1:27:43	1:27:48	f	68	5268			and to the right 
1:29:7	1:29:16	g	168	5356			alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
1:29:15	1:29:22	g	305	5362			like
1:29:18	1:29:27	g	47	5367			IY re sloping
1:30:14	1:30:17	g	53	5417			now IY re at the collapsed shelter
1:30:26	1:30:34	g	293	5434			uhm
1:32:41	1:32:50	g	32	5570			ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
1:35:21	1:35:30	f	142	5730			IY have to back up a little bit
1:35:34	1:35:40	g	230	5740			ok
1:36:55	1:36:59	g	155	5819			and then IY go
1:37:28	1:37:29	g	44	5849			IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
1:39:58	1:40:6	g	228	6006			ok
1:43:38	1:43:43	g	159	6223			uhm
1:46:34	1:46:36	g	134	6396			ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
1:48:54	1:48:58	f	336	6538			elephants 
1:48:54	1:48:59	f	45	6539			yeah
1:50:33	1:50:34	f	313	6634			yeah
1:51:41	1:51:44	g	7	6704			to the left
1:52:13	1:52:13	f	296	6733			curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
1:54:12	1:54:13	g	248	6853			ok IY re at the savannah
1:58:45	1:58:48	g	130	7128			IY wanna kind of curve
2:1:5	2:1:11	g	164	7271			and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
2:2:2	2:2:11	g	214	7331			IY would say
2:4:52	2:4:56	g	92	7496			uhm
2:6:26	2:6:26	f	23	7586			and curve down to the left 
2:7:54	2:8:3	g	6	7683			and IY re sloping to the left
2:8:8	2:8:9	f	197	7689			ok
2:8:26	2:8:29	f	338	7709			IY hit some rocks though
2:9:11	2:9:15	f	66	7755			to the left
2:10:14	2:10:21	g	182	7821			and that s where the plane crash is
2:11:40	2:11:42	f	189	7902			ok
2:12:21	2:12:30	g	326	7950			IY make
2:12:48	2:12:49	f	217	7969			ok
2:13:34	2:13:37	g	97	8017			uhm
2:13:34	2:13:42	g	272	8022			in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
2:14:5	2:14:14	g	14	8054			and IY should have a straight line there
2:15:56	2:16:0	g	75	8160			IY re starting at the stony desert
2:15:59	2:16:1	g	30	8161			and 
2:16:43	2:16:47	g	131	8207			ok 
2:18:30	2:18:38	g	298	8318			ok
2:18:33	2:18:42	g	289	8322			and
2:18:46	2:18:50	g	176	8330			and then IY slope
2:20:15	2:20:17	f	11	8417			so IY pass a waterhole or no 
2:20:43	2:20:46	f	171	8446			ok
2:21:5	2:21:10	f	275	8470			ok
2:22:34	2:22:42	g	237	8562			IY plane crash 
2:28:22	2:28:31	g	166	8911			ok
2:29:2	2:29:5	g	108	8945			and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
2:30:24	2:30:33	g	249	9033			IY go straight down
2:33:2	2:33:2	g	38	9182			three inches straight across
2:34:37	2:34:45	f	252	9285			but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
2:34:49	2:34:53	f	72	9293			ok
2:35:22	2:35:22	f	49	9322			do IY go by the plane crash 
2:35:25	2:35:32	g	318	9332			yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
2:36:40	2:36:45	g	213	9405			IY move to the left
2:37:57	2:38:4	f	323	9484			ok
2:39:17	2:39:26	g	129	9566			a little
2:40:4	2:40:12	g	239	9612			to IY right 
2:40:27	2:40:27	f	118	9627			ok
2:40:40	2:40:46	g	105	9646			like four or five inches to the left
2:44:31	2:44:37	g	25	9877			about like
2:45:15	2:45:23	g	260	9923			and IY re going
2:45:28	2:45:35	g	278	9935			and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
2:47:26	2:47:31	g	310	10051			well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
2:47:44	2:47:47	f	321	10067			yeah
2:48:36	2:48:45	g	307	10125			and IY go down IY slope to the right
2:48:56	2:48:57	f	96	10137			nope
2:50:5	2:50:10	g	34	10210			where IY re going down to a plane crash
2:50:22	2:50:23	f	297	10223			ok
2:53:12	2:53:13	g	74	10393			ok and then IY re going

3:4:30	3:4:33	g	287	11073			to the lake 
3:8:9	3:8:11	g	258	11291			on IY sheet anyway
3:10:33	3:10:36	g	140	11436			and then IY ll come to a savannah
3:10:52	3:10:59	g	329	11459			uhm

3:17:43	3:17:47	g	198	11867			and IY slope is about an inch long
3:19:11	3:19:14	g	26	11954			uhm
3:20:36	3:20:42	g	303	12042			uhm

3:24:56	3:24:57	g	322	12297			IY re just going down
3:25:37	3:25:46	g	52	12346			right next to IY circle should be roman baths
3:26:2	3:26:2	g	183	12362			and there s a plane crash
3:27:2	3:27:8	g	132	12428			and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
3:27:28	3:27:36	g	277	12456			and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
3:27:36	3:27:37	g	335	12457			yes
3:30:32	3:30:38	g	135	12638			are IY anywhere near there 
3:31:58	3:31:59	g	315	12719			and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
3:32:49	3:32:51	g	104	12771			like IY re sloping
3:32:55	3:32:56	f	102	12776			to the right 
3:36:32	3:36:34	g	229	12994			alright 
3:38:4	3:38:8	g	316	13088			after plane crash
3:38:20	3:38:23	g	153	13103			to the white mountain
3:39:32	3:39:37	f	126	13177			ok

3:50:11	3:50:17	g	227	13817			uhm
3:51:10	3:51:11	g	57	13871			the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
3:52:46	3:52:54	f	220	13974			ok
3:54:55	3:55:4	g	76	14104			and then
3:55:45	3:55:52	g	257	14152			the slate mountain is towards the right
3:57:36	3:57:43	g	238	14263			as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
3:59:7	3:59:10	f	304	14350			mm hmm
3:59:37	3:59:44	g	288	14384			to the left
4:0:7	4:0:12	g	100	14412			uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
4:2:44	4:2:44	f	19	14564			ok

4:9:56	4:10:4	g	311	15004			so IY re at the hot springs
4:12:30	4:12:32	g	149	15152			IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
4:12:43	4:12:45	g	9	15165			ok
4:14:34	4:14:38	g	255	15278			three inches

4:28:2	4:28:8	g	283	16088			and then IY are
4:28:56	4:28:56	g	87	16136			IY slope down again
4:30:16	4:30:22	g	280	16222			are IY in like   
4:33:15	4:33:24	g	128	16404			so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
4:36:48	4:36:52	f	98	16612			do IY go around it 
4:37:24	4:37:28	f	56	16648			IY ve a plane crash though
4:38:32	4:38:32	g	62	16712			maybe like
4:40:49	4:40:51	g	200	16851			do IY have roman baths 
4:40:58	4:41:4	g	306	16864			maybe four inches on the paper
4:41:15	4:41:19	g	281	16879			around the bottom of it
4:41:20	4:41:27	g	54	16887			IY re at the plane crash
4:44:38	4:44:46	g	64	17086			IY have a waterhole on IY map 
4:45:29	4:45:32	g	71	17132			just a slight slope
4:45:44	4:45:51	g	150	17151			go up like three  three and a half inches
4:45:58	4:45:58	g	333	17158			and then IY slope down to the left
4:46:1	4:46:1	g	263	17161			like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
4:46:40	4:46:47	f	186	17207			so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
4:48:7	4:48:13	g	29	17293			uhm
4:51:30	4:51:37	g	146	17497			well

5:0:37	5:0:44	g	205	18044			and then
5:1:46	5:1:47	g	163	18107			IY just kind of slope down
5:2:27	5:2:29	g	274	18149			maybe
