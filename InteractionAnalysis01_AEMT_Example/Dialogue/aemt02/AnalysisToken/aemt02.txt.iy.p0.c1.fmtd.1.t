5	1:6:25	1:7:47	uhm
6	1:7:47	1:8:7	kind of across from stony desert
7	1:8:7	1:9:24	and
8	1:9:24	1:10:20	IY re kind of going  
9	1:10:20	1:11:16	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
10	1:11:16	1:11:17	and IY re going
11	1:11:17	1:13:7	IY would say
12	1:13:7	1:13:12	maybe
13	1:13:12	1:14:51	couple miles or something

15	1:15:18	1:16:30	uhm
16	1:16:30	1:17:29	where IY re going down to a plane crash
17	1:17:29	1:18:38	uhm
18	1:18:38	1:18:47	there s a there s  
20	1:19:53	1:21:45	ok
22	1:23:19	1:23:52	ok
23	1:23:52	1:24:33	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
25	1:25:11	1:26:32	and IY go to the left a little bit
26	1:26:32	1:28:0	and then
27	1:28:0	1:28:50	uhm
28	1:28:50	1:29:13	IY just kind of slope down
29	1:29:13	1:30:42	a little bit too
30	1:30:42	1:31:16	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
31	1:31:16	1:33:15	after IY slope down IY d say
32	1:33:15	1:34:6	like
33	1:34:6	1:35:33	maybe like
34	1:35:33	1:35:48	couple inches IY re sloping down
35	1:35:48	1:37:15	and then IY go straight
36	1:37:15	1:39:14	for like
37	1:39:14	1:40:40	like
38	1:40:40	1:41:0	five
39	1:41:0	1:42:7	maybe four inches on the paper
40	1:42:7	1:42:24	and there s a plane crash
45	1:46:42	1:48:2	IY plane crash 
47	1:49:34	1:50:8	uhm
48	1:50:8	1:52:5	alright are IY starting  near the  
50	1:53:49	1:55:19	are IY  
51	1:55:19	1:57:2	IY re starting at the stony desert
53	1:58:3	1:58:13	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
55	1:59:21	2:0:18	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
56	2:0:18	2:2:8	not right at the stony desert
58	2:3:12	2:3:37	ok and then IY re going
60	2:4:51	2:6:31	to the left
61	2:6:31	2:8:21	like an inch
62	2:8:21	2:10:7	and then IY re going down
63	2:10:7	2:11:52	like maybe an inch
64	2:11:52	2:13:21	that s IY little slope
66	2:13:45	2:14:24	and then IY go
67	2:14:24	2:16:4	like four or five inches to the left
68	2:16:4	2:17:15	and that s where the plane crash is
69	2:17:15	2:18:44	are IY anywhere near there 
72	2:20:45	2:22:35	four or five inches to the left
74	2:23:34	2:25:17	and then
75	2:25:17	2:25:31	after plane crash
78	2:26:3	2:27:39	ok IY plane crash isn t there
79	2:27:39	2:28:19	uhm
80	2:28:19	2:29:18	alright well IY ll keep going and see
81	2:29:18	2:30:54	alright 
82	2:30:54	2:32:5	so
83	2:32:5	2:32:6	uhm
84	2:32:6	2:33:25	IY re at the plane crash
85	2:33:25	2:34:30	and
86	2:34:30	2:34:57	IY wanna kind of curve
87	2:34:57	2:36:35	a little
88	2:36:35	2:37:28	to the left
89	2:37:28	2:39:5	and then IY  IY go up
90	2:39:5	2:39:51	and IY re going up like
91	2:39:51	2:40:28	three inches
93	2:42:20	2:44:0	and 
94	2:44:0	2:45:5	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
95	2:45:5	2:46:32	it s not a big curve
97	2:48:19	2:49:4	ok
98	2:49:4	2:49:40	and then
99	2:49:40	2:50:27	uhm
100	2:50:27	2:51:53	after that IY go straight again
101	2:51:53	2:52:26	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
102	2:52:26	2:53:30	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
103	2:53:30	2:53:43	are IY anywere near there 
105	2:54:33	2:55:8	ok
107	2:55:55	2:57:3	yes
109	2:57:44	2:57:54	yes
111	2:59:31	3:0:47	ok
112	3:0:47	3:1:13	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
113	3:1:13	3:1:14	and IY go down IY slope to the right
114	3:1:14	3:1:31	just a slight slope
115	3:1:31	3:2:38	about like
116	3:2:38	3:3:17	an inch maybe a little bit less
118	3:4:6	3:5:28	to the right
119	3:5:28	3:6:28	IY re sloping
122	3:7:59	3:8:6	ok
123	3:8:6	3:9:31	and then
124	3:9:31	3:10:45	you
125	3:10:45	3:11:4	have a s 
126	3:11:4	3:11:21	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
127	3:11:21	3:12:32	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
129	3:14:5	3:15:1	slight
130	3:15:1	3:16:29	uhm
131	3:16:29	3:17:4	and then IY ll come to a savannah
133	3:17:46	3:19:16	ok
135	3:20:17	3:21:32	uhhh no
136	3:21:32	3:22:14	no IY don t have a waterhole
137	3:22:14	3:23:1	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
139	3:23:4	3:25:1	well
140	3:25:1	3:25:2	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
142	3:25:28	3:25:28	ok
144	3:26:17	3:27:7	ok IY re at the savannah
145	3:27:7	3:28:8	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
146	3:28:8	3:29:28	like
147	3:29:28	3:30:9	three inches
149	3:30:23	3:30:40	and IY re going straight up
150	3:30:40	3:31:40	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
152	3:32:7	3:32:30	ok well
153	3:32:30	3:33:18	probably the same thing
156	3:33:45	3:35:27	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
158	3:36:51	3:38:23	straight up
160	3:39:53	3:40:28	hmm
161	3:40:28	3:41:9	well
162	3:41:9	3:42:39	IY don t know
163	3:42:39	3:44:18	alright 
164	3:44:18	3:45:28	well just
166	3:47:0	3:48:32	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
167	3:48:32	3:48:43	the slate mountain is towards the right
168	3:48:43	3:48:48	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
169	3:48:48	3:50:8	are IY in like   
170	3:50:8	3:50:42	are IY in like almost the top of the
172	3:51:40	3:52:49	no IY have  
173	3:52:49	3:53:46	maybe IY have different things
174	3:53:46	3:55:14	well alright
176	3:56:40	3:58:32	alright alright well just
177	3:58:32	3:58:54	just do it like this ok
178	3:58:54	4:0:39	go up like three  three and a half inches
180	4:0:45	4:2:2	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
182	4:3:19	4:5:6	it s right next to it
183	4:5:6	4:5:53	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
185	4:6:49	4:7:7	maybe like
186	4:7:7	4:8:56	a quarter of an inch
187	4:8:56	4:9:24	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
190	4:11:30	4:12:26	ok
191	4:12:26	4:13:39	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
192	4:13:39	4:13:43	for like
193	4:13:43	4:14:44	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
195	4:15:27	4:17:23	and then IY slope down to the left
196	4:17:23	4:18:50	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
198	4:19:42	4:20:46	ok
199	4:20:46	4:21:19	and then
200	4:21:19	4:22:4	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
202	4:23:17	4:23:29	ok
203	4:23:29	4:23:54	so IY re at the hot springs
204	4:23:54	4:25:35	and IY re sloping to the left
205	4:25:35	4:27:4	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
207	4:27:34	4:29:13	ok
208	4:29:13	4:30:41	and then
209	4:30:41	4:31:38	uhm
210	4:31:38	4:32:45	IY slope down again
212	4:33:28	4:33:47	uhm
213	4:33:47	4:35:8	no there s no elephants
214	4:35:8	4:35:25	on IY sheet anyway
217	4:36:32	4:38:0	no
218	4:38:0	4:38:23	IY re just going down
219	4:38:23	4:39:38	like IY re sloping
220	4:39:38	4:39:52	and IY slope is about an inch long
221	4:39:52	4:41:16	and is to the left
223	4:42:14	4:43:44	ok
224	4:43:44	4:44:13	and then
225	4:44:13	4:45:24	uhm
226	4:45:24	4:45:33	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
227	4:45:33	4:46:35	to the left
229	4:46:49	4:46:50	ok
230	4:46:50	4:47:26	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
232	4:48:30	4:49:36	to the white mountain
234	4:49:48	4:50:41	ok 
235	4:50:41	4:50:45	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
236	4:50:45	4:51:55	and it slopes a little bit to the right
237	4:51:55	4:52:47	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
239	4:53:0	4:53:11	ok
240	4:53:11	4:55:5	so that s about IY would say
241	4:55:5	4:56:24	that s about five or six inches
243	4:58:14	4:58:29	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
245	4:58:38	5:0:37	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
246	5:0:37	5:1:22	and IY just go straight up
247	5:1:22	5:1:47	for about two inches
248	5:1:47	5:3:6	ok
250	5:3:9	5:3:22	then
252	5:3:40	5:3:48	no IY don t have any rocks
254	5:5:8	5:6:14	ok
256	5:7:50	5:9:0	ok
257	5:9:0	5:10:4	uhm
258	5:10:4	5:10:56	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
259	5:10:56	5:11:48	and then IY slope
260	5:11:48	5:11:48	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
262	5:13:1	5:14:21	yes IY re going towards the lake
264	5:15:47	5:16:24	but
265	5:16:24	5:16:31	IY re going about
266	5:16:31	5:17:18	three inches straight across
267	5:17:18	5:19:14	to the lake 
268	5:19:14	5:21:7	and then IY are
269	5:21:7	5:21:13	IY got that 
271	5:22:52	5:24:35	uhm
272	5:24:35	5:26:26	no
273	5:26:26	5:26:53	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
274	5:26:53	5:28:36	so IY go three inches straight
275	5:28:36	5:28:43	and then IY slope up
276	5:28:43	5:30:22	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
278	5:31:37	5:31:54	the  
279	5:31:54	5:33:28	what 
281	5:35:25	5:36:54	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
283	5:38:18	5:39:5	ok
284	5:39:5	5:40:44	and then
285	5:40:44	5:41:6	uhm
286	5:41:6	5:42:15	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
287	5:42:15	5:43:1	do IY have roman baths 
289	5:43:18	5:43:58	ok well
290	5:43:58	5:45:30	they re there
291	5:45:30	5:47:27	so anyway
292	5:47:27	5:49:17	IY make
294	5:49:47	5:50:32	what 
296	5:51:1	5:51:5	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
297	5:51:5	5:52:31	so IY make that circle
300	5:53:17	5:53:21	and 
301	5:53:21	5:54:5	after the circle
302	5:54:5	5:54:46	uhm
303	5:54:46	5:56:17	IY move to the left
304	5:56:17	5:57:55	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
306	5:59:52	6:1:34	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
307	6:1:34	6:2:30	like three inches 
308	6:2:30	6:3:28	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
310	6:5:16	6:6:11	ok
311	6:6:11	6:6:25	IY go straight down
312	6:6:25	6:7:57	uh like
313	6:7:57	6:9:5	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
316	6:10:36	6:11:42	uhm
318	6:13:23	6:14:8	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
320	6:16:0	6:16:22	is the plane crash  
321	6:16:22	6:17:28	like
322	6:17:28	6:18:59	to IY right 
325	6:19:51	6:21:40	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
327	6:23:25	6:23:44	IY re going like
329	6:24:9	6:25:41	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
330	6:25:41	6:26:29	and IY should have a straight line there
333	6:28:57	6:30:11	ok
334	6:30:11	6:31:27	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
336	6:31:27	6:31:47	around the bottom of it
338	6:32:3	6:33:49	ok
340	6:34:55	6:36:31	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
342	6:37:44	6:38:58	ok
start f
0	01:01:01	1:1:13	ok
19	1:18:47	1:19:53	ok wait hold on

42	1:43:36	1:44:43	uh IY don t know know what to say
43	1:44:43	1:45:39	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
44	1:45:39	1:46:42	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
46	1:48:2	1:49:34	mm  mm
49	1:52:5	1:53:49	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert

65	2:13:21	2:13:45	ok
70	2:18:44	2:19:52	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
71	2:19:52	2:20:45	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
73	2:22:35	2:23:34	ok
76	2:25:31	2:25:40	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
77	2:25:40	2:26:3	ok

106	2:55:8	2:55:55	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
108	2:57:3	2:57:44	and there s a collapsed shelter
110	2:57:54	2:59:31	ok
117	3:3:17	3:4:6	to the right 
120	3:6:28	3:7:58	ok

39	1:41:0	1:42:7	maybe four inches on the paper
40	1:42:7	1:42:24	and there s a plane crash
45	1:46:42	1:48:2	IY plane crash 
47	1:49:34	1:50:8	uhm
48	1:50:8	1:52:5	alright are IY starting  near the  
50	1:53:49	1:55:19	are IY  
51	1:55:19	1:57:2	IY re starting at the stony desert
53	1:58:3	1:58:13	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
55	1:59:21	2:0:18	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
56	2:0:18	2:2:8	not right at the stony desert
58	2:3:12	2:3:37	ok and then IY re going
60	2:4:51	2:6:31	to the left
61	2:6:31	2:8:21	like an inch
62	2:8:21	2:10:7	and then IY re going down
63	2:10:7	2:11:52	like maybe an inch
64	2:11:52	2:13:21	that s IY little slope
66	2:13:45	2:14:24	and then IY go
67	2:14:24	2:16:4	like four or five inches to the left
68	2:16:4	2:17:15	and that s where the plane crash is
69	2:17:15	2:18:44	are IY anywhere near there 
72	2:20:45	2:22:35	four or five inches to the left
74	2:23:34	2:25:17	and then
75	2:25:17	2:25:31	after plane crash
78	2:26:3	2:27:39	ok IY plane crash isn t there
79	2:27:39	2:28:19	uhm
80	2:28:19	2:29:18	alright well IY ll keep going and see
81	2:29:18	2:30:54	alright

83	2:32:5	2:32:6	uhm
84	2:32:6	2:33:25	IY re at the plane crash
85	2:33:25	2:34:30	and
86	2:34:30	2:34:57	IY wanna kind of curve
87	2:34:57	2:36:35	a little
88	2:36:35	2:37:28	to the left
89	2:37:28	2:39:5	and then IY  IY go up

91	2:39:51	2:40:28	three inches
93	2:42:20	2:44:0	and 
94	2:44:0	2:45:5	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
95	2:45:5	2:46:32	it s not a big curve
97	2:48:19	2:49:4	ok
98	2:49:4	2:49:40	and then
99	2:49:40	2:50:27	uhm
100	2:50:27	2:51:53	after that IY go straight again
101	2:51:53	2:52:26	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
102	2:52:26	2:53:30	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
103	2:53:30	2:53:43	are IY anywere near there 
105	2:54:33	2:55:8	ok
107	2:55:55	2:57:3	yes

111	2:59:31	3:0:47	ok
112	3:0:47	3:1:13	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
113	3:1:13	3:1:14	and IY go down IY slope to the right
114	3:1:14	3:1:31	just a slight slope
115	3:1:31	3:2:38	about like
116	3:2:38	3:3:17	an inch maybe a little bit less
118	3:4:6	3:5:28	to the right
119	3:5:28	3:6:28	IY re sloping
122	3:7:59	3:8:6	ok
123	3:8:6	3:9:31	and then
124	3:9:31	3:10:45	you
125	3:10:45	3:11:4	have a s 
126	3:11:4	3:11:21	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
127	3:11:21	3:12:32	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
129	3:14:5	3:15:1	slight
130	3:15:1	3:16:29	uhm
131	3:16:29	3:17:4	and then IY ll come to a savannah

136	3:21:32	3:22:14	no IY don t have a waterhole
137	3:22:14	3:23:1	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
139	3:23:4	3:25:1	well
140	3:25:1	3:25:2	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
142	3:25:28	3:25:28	ok
144	3:26:17	3:27:7	ok IY re at the savannah
145	3:27:7	3:28:8	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
146	3:28:8	3:29:28	like
147	3:29:28	3:30:9	three inches
149	3:30:23	3:30:40	and IY re going straight up
150	3:30:40	3:31:40	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
152	3:32:7	3:32:30	ok well
153	3:32:30	3:33:18	probably the same thing
156	3:33:45	3:35:27	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
158	3:36:51	3:38:23	straight up
160	3:39:53	3:40:28	hmm
161	3:40:28	3:41:9	well
162	3:41:9	3:42:39	IY don t know

164	3:44:18	3:45:28	well just
166	3:47:0	3:48:32	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
167	3:48:32	3:48:43	the slate mountain is towards the right
168	3:48:43	3:48:48	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
169	3:48:48	3:50:8	are IY in like   
170	3:50:8	3:50:42	are IY in like almost the top of the
172	3:51:40	3:52:49	no IY have  
173	3:52:49	3:53:46	maybe IY have different things
174	3:53:46	3:55:14	well alright
176	3:56:40	3:58:32	alright alright well just
177	3:58:32	3:58:54	just do it like this ok
178	3:58:54	4:0:39	go up like three  three and a half inches
180	4:0:45	4:2:2	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
182	4:3:19	4:5:6	it s right next to it
183	4:5:6	4:5:53	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
185	4:6:49	4:7:7	maybe like
186	4:7:7	4:8:56	a quarter of an inch
187	4:8:56	4:9:24	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
190	4:11:30	4:12:26	ok
191	4:12:26	4:13:39	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
192	4:13:39	4:13:43	for like
193	4:13:43	4:14:44	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
195	4:15:27	4:17:23	and then IY slope down to the left
196	4:17:23	4:18:50	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
198	4:19:42	4:20:46	ok
199	4:20:46	4:21:19	and then
200	4:21:19	4:22:4	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
202	4:23:17	4:23:29	ok
203	4:23:29	4:23:54	so IY re at the hot springs
204	4:23:54	4:25:35	and IY re sloping to the left
205	4:25:35	4:27:4	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
207	4:27:34	4:29:13	ok
208	4:29:13	4:30:41	and then
209	4:30:41	4:31:38	uhm
210	4:31:38	4:32:45	IY slope down again
212	4:33:28	4:33:47	uhm
213	4:33:47	4:35:8	no there s no elephants
214	4:35:8	4:35:25	on IY sheet anyway
217	4:36:32	4:38:0	no
218	4:38:0	4:38:23	IY re just going down
219	4:38:23	4:39:38	like IY re sloping
220	4:39:38	4:39:52	and IY slope is about an inch long
221	4:39:52	4:41:16	and is to the left
223	4:42:14	4:43:44	ok
224	4:43:44	4:44:13	and then
225	4:44:13	4:45:24	uhm
226	4:45:24	4:45:33	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
227	4:45:33	4:46:35	to the left
229	4:46:49	4:46:50	ok
230	4:46:50	4:47:26	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
232	4:48:30	4:49:36	to the white mountain
234	4:49:48	4:50:41	ok 
235	4:50:41	4:50:45	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
236	4:50:45	4:51:55	and it slopes a little bit to the right
237	4:51:55	4:52:47	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
239	4:53:0	4:53:11	ok
240	4:53:11	4:55:5	so that s about IY would say
241	4:55:5	4:56:24	that s about five or six inches
243	4:58:14	4:58:29	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
245	4:58:38	5:0:37	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
246	5:0:37	5:1:22	and IY just go straight up
247	5:1:22	5:1:47	for about two inches
248	5:1:47	5:3:6	ok
250	5:3:9	5:3:22	then
252	5:3:40	5:3:48	no IY don t have any rocks
254	5:5:8	5:6:14	ok
256	5:7:50	5:9:0	ok
257	5:9:0	5:10:4	uhm
258	5:10:4	5:10:56	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
259	5:10:56	5:11:48	and then IY slope
260	5:11:48	5:11:48	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
262	5:13:1	5:14:21	yes IY re going towards the lake
264	5:15:47	5:16:24	but
265	5:16:24	5:16:31	IY re going about
266	5:16:31	5:17:18	three inches straight across
267	5:17:18	5:19:14	to the lake 
268	5:19:14	5:21:7	and then IY are
269	5:21:7	5:21:13	IY got that 
271	5:22:52	5:24:35	uhm
272	5:24:35	5:26:26	no
273	5:26:26	5:26:53	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
274	5:26:53	5:28:36	so IY go three inches straight
275	5:28:36	5:28:43	and then IY slope up
276	5:28:43	5:30:22	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
278	5:31:37	5:31:54	the  
279	5:31:54	5:33:28	what 
281	5:35:25	5:36:54	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
283	5:38:18	5:39:5	ok
284	5:39:5	5:40:44	and then
285	5:40:44	5:41:6	uhm
286	5:41:6	5:42:15	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
287	5:42:15	5:43:1	do IY have roman baths 
289	5:43:18	5:43:58	ok well
290	5:43:58	5:45:30	they re there
291	5:45:30	5:47:27	so anyway

294	5:49:47	5:50:32	what 
296	5:51:1	5:51:5	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
297	5:51:5	5:52:31	so IY make that circle
300	5:53:17	5:53:21	and 
301	5:53:21	5:54:5	after the circle
302	5:54:5	5:54:46	uhm
303	5:54:46	5:56:17	IY move to the left
304	5:56:17	5:57:55	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
306	5:59:52	6:1:34	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
307	6:1:34	6:2:30	like three inches 
308	6:2:30	6:3:28	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
310	6:5:16	6:6:11	ok

318	6:13:23	6:14:8	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
320	6:16:0	6:16:22	is the plane crash  
321	6:16:22	6:17:28	like
322	6:17:28	6:18:59	to IY right
