0	0:0:16	0:0:23	yes
1	0:0:47	0:0:50	about like
2	0:0:58	0:1:1	uhm
3	0:0:57	0:1:6	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
4	0:1:15	0:1:23	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
7	0:3:10	0:3:14	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
10	0:5:1	0:5:7	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
14	0:9:59	0:10:0	just a slight slope
15	0:10:31	0:10:38	and then IY ll come to a savannah
16	0:11:4	0:11:5	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
18	0:15:31	0:15:31	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
19	0:15:40	0:15:40	like
20	0:16:3	0:16:5	three inches
22	0:16:56	0:17:3	uhm
23	0:18:5	0:18:7	so
24	0:18:12	0:18:20	and is to the left
26	0:23:43	0:23:46	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
27	0:24:37	0:24:43	uhm
28	0:27:29	0:27:35	and then
29	0:27:33	0:27:42	maybe four inches on the paper
31	0:28:29	0:28:37	ok
34	0:29:1	0:29:4	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
35	0:29:33	0:29:39	five
36	0:31:50	0:31:56	uhm
37	0:32:4	0:32:7	ok
38	0:32:30	0:32:30	like four or five inches to the left
39	0:33:14	0:33:19	maybe IY have different things
40	0:33:45	0:33:47	ok well
41	0:34:37	0:34:42	just do it like this ok
42	0:35:21	0:35:22	after that IY go straight again
43	0:36:40	0:36:42	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
44	0:36:45	0:36:53	where IY re going down to a plane crash
45	0:38:16	0:38:19	well
46	0:38:37	0:38:39	IY wanna kind of curve
48	0:43:9	0:43:17	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
49	0:44:6	0:44:6	and
50	0:44:25	0:44:28	to IY right 
51	0:45:10	0:45:19	uhm
52	0:45:23	0:45:32	what 
53	0:46:31	0:46:40	no
54	0:46:36	0:46:41	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
55	0:47:39	0:47:46	and then IY  IY go up
56	0:49:55	0:50:3	like three inches 
57	0:52:5	0:52:12	IY re kind of going  
58	0:53:21	0:53:21	uhm
60	0:53:49	0:53:58	for like
61	0:54:22	0:54:26	to the left
63	0:55:37	0:55:39	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
64	0:57:8	0:57:13	IY re at the plane crash
65	0:57:16	0:57:19	ok
66	1:0:19	1:0:20	well alright
67	1:0:25	1:0:33	are IY anywere near there 
68	1:0:29	1:0:38	a quarter of an inch
69	1:1:29	1:1:37	and IY slope is about an inch long
70	1:5:4	1:5:12	around the bottom of it
71	1:6:30	1:6:32	like an inch
72	1:8:8	1:8:16	to the lake 
73	1:8:25	1:8:30	and that s where the plane crash is
74	1:9:26	1:9:34	and 
75	1:10:34	1:10:36	uhm
77	1:12:24	1:12:27	uhm
79	1:18:10	1:18:18	not right at the stony desert
80	1:18:12	1:18:20	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
81	1:20:33	1:20:41	ok
82	1:21:59	1:22:3	alright are IY starting  near the  
83	1:22:49	1:22:57	after IY slope down IY d say
85	1:24:17	1:24:18	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
86	1:24:34	1:24:37	but
89	1:30:9	1:30:10	they re there
91	1:33:37	1:33:41	maybe

93	1:34:50	1:34:54	ok
94	1:35:51	1:35:56	couple inches IY re sloping down
95	1:39:2	1:39:6	and IY re sloping to the left
98	1:44:31	1:44:34	ok
99	1:46:26	1:46:28	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
100	1:46:41	1:46:43	IY re just going down
101	1:47:29	1:47:36	ok
102	1:47:38	1:47:41	there s a there s  
103	1:48:14	1:48:16	hmm
104	1:48:43	1:48:48	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
105	1:48:56	1:49:4	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
106	1:52:57	1:52:59	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
108	1:55:12	1:55:14	uhm
109	1:55:12	1:55:15	on IY sheet anyway
110	1:56:13	1:56:16	alright well IY ll keep going and see
111	2:0:21	2:0:23	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
112	2:1:45	2:1:54	ok
113	2:2:50	2:2:55	it s not a big curve
115	2:4:7	2:4:15	and IY should have a straight line there
117	2:4:33	2:4:34	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
118	2:8:1	2:8:9	uhm
119	2:8:30	2:8:35	IY plane crash 
121	2:9:8	2:9:10	and
123	2:10:22	2:10:22	you
124	2:11:48	2:11:56	ok well

133	2:28:10	2:28:14	ok
135	2:29:24	2:29:25	IY make
137	2:32:49	2:32:49	couple miles or something
139	2:34:23	2:34:23	IY would say
140	2:35:42	2:35:50	uhm
141	2:37:35	2:37:42	and IY go to the left a little bit
142	2:42:0	2:42:5	so IY re at the hot springs
144	2:44:46	2:44:50	so IY go three inches straight
146	2:46:23	2:46:25	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
147	2:46:47	2:46:47	and then IY slope down to the left
148	2:47:28	2:47:34	and then IY re going down
149	2:47:43	2:47:49	maybe like
151	2:52:32	2:52:36	ok
152	2:52:57	2:52:57	alright 
154	2:54:3	2:54:7	yes
155	2:55:50	2:55:55	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
157	2:56:49	2:56:51	uhm
158	2:59:29	2:59:32	alright alright well just
161	3:2:13	3:2:13	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything

164	3:7:25	3:7:26	IY re going like
165	3:7:55	3:7:59	and IY re going up like
166	3:8:8	3:8:13	ok
167	3:8:48	3:8:51	ok IY plane crash isn t there
168	3:8:48	3:8:51	IY slope down again
170	3:14:16	3:14:20	ok
171	3:17:31	3:17:33	like
174	3:20:58	3:21:2	to the left
175	3:21:2	3:21:8	IY re actually starting like right
177	3:22:6	3:22:10	and then
181	3:25:48	3:25:57	ok
182	3:27:18	3:27:26	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
183	3:28:6	3:28:13	a little
184	3:28:45	3:28:47	alright 
186	3:29:44	3:29:50	and 
187	3:30:7	3:30:15	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
188	3:34:0	3:34:0	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
189	3:34:10	3:34:10	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
194	3:40:2	3:40:3	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
195	3:41:15	3:41:23	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
196	3:44:32	3:44:34	IY re sloping
198	3:47:27	3:47:29	ok
199	3:48:54	3:48:54	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
200	3:49:31	3:49:37	kind of across from stony desert
201	3:50:6	3:50:9	uhhh no
202	3:51:25	3:51:29	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
203	3:52:39	3:52:41	no IY have  
204	3:53:42	3:53:48	and then IY slope up
205	3:54:17	3:54:21	and then
207	3:55:4	3:55:7	like
208	3:55:15	3:55:20	do IY have roman baths 
210	4:5:24	4:5:24	the  
211	4:6:30	4:6:31	and IY re going straight up
212	4:6:32	4:6:36	uhm
217	4:10:9	4:10:15	an inch maybe a little bit less
219	4:11:7	4:11:12	what 
220	4:11:12	4:11:15	and then
221	4:11:15	4:11:21	so IY make that circle
222	4:11:22	4:11:26	straight up
223	4:11:24	4:11:26	like IY re sloping
224	4:12:41	4:12:47	IY re going about
225	4:12:53	4:13:1	are IY anywhere near there 
226	4:17:41	4:17:42	and it slopes a little bit to the right
227	4:18:25	4:18:27	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
228	4:21:42	4:21:43	are IY  
229	4:22:20	4:22:23	IY don t know
231	4:24:16	4:24:23	and then
232	4:25:19	4:25:19	well
233	4:27:4	4:27:7	ok
234	4:28:15	4:28:19	ok IY re at the savannah
235	4:28:39	4:28:39	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
236	4:29:5	4:29:6	uhm
237	4:29:58	4:30:7	after plane crash
238	4:32:1	4:32:9	no IY don t have any rocks
239	4:33:14	4:33:15	IY re starting
240	4:33:9	4:33:17	ok
241	4:33:13	4:33:20	no
242	4:34:47	4:34:52	that s about five or six inches
243	4:35:7	4:35:8	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
244	4:35:8	4:35:16	well just
245	4:35:48	4:35:56	are IY in like almost the top of the
247	4:37:0	4:37:2	go up like three  three and a half inches
249	4:38:2	4:38:2	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
250	4:40:12	4:40:13	IY move to the left
252	4:40:54	4:41:2	uhm
253	4:43:26	4:43:34	ok 
254	4:47:45	4:47:46	ok
255	4:48:22	4:48:28	IY go straight down
256	4:51:41	4:51:49	four or five inches to the left
258	4:52:7	4:52:11	to the right
259	4:53:10	4:53:11	have a s 
261	4:54:33	4:54:39	no IY don t have a waterhole
262	4:54:47	4:54:48	and IY re going
263	4:54:53	4:54:55	uhm
264	4:56:27	4:56:30	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
265	4:57:7	4:57:9	ok
268	5:0:29	5:0:36	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
270	5:4:31	5:4:39	no there s no elephants
271	5:4:34	5:4:42	to the white mountain
272	5:6:11	5:6:15	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
273	5:6:36	5:6:41	ok and then IY re going
277	5:9:57	5:10:2	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
278	5:10:13	5:10:16	and then
279	5:15:24	5:15:32	for about two inches
280	5:16:20	5:16:25	maybe like
281	5:17:12	5:17:16	are IY in like   
282	5:17:18	5:17:23	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
285	5:21:6	5:21:12	from
286	5:21:11	5:21:14	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
287	5:21:36	5:21:42	a little bit too
290	5:25:1	5:25:4	and then
292	5:27:25	5:27:32	yes IY re going towards the lake
293	5:28:48	5:28:57	uhm and there is a stony desert
295	5:30:33	5:30:38	it s right next to it
296	5:32:11	5:32:16	uh like
297	5:32:36	5:32:40	that s IY little slope
298	5:36:16	5:36:18	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
300	5:40:2	5:40:5	and then IY slope
303	5:43:5	5:43:5	ok
304	5:43:37	5:43:42	three inches
305	5:44:0	5:44:1	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
306	5:47:48	5:47:55	uhm
307	5:47:57	5:47:59	so anyway
308	5:51:45	5:51:48	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
309	5:55:10	5:55:13	probably the same thing
310	5:56:7	5:56:12	to the left
312	5:56:30	5:56:34	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
315	5:57:7	5:57:16	and then IY go straight
317	5:58:46	5:58:49	slight
319	6:6:16	6:6:23	is the plane crash  
320	6:6:40	6:6:46	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
322	6:8:38	6:8:45	after the circle
323	6:8:41	6:8:45	ok
325	6:10:51	6:10:58	ok
326	6:10:58	6:11:5	and then
327	6:13:35	6:13:39	IY re starting at the stony desert
328	6:16:9	6:16:11	and IY go down IY slope to the right
329	6:17:42	6:17:45	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
331	6:18:14	6:18:19	so that s about IY would say
332	6:19:34	6:19:39	and IY just go straight up
333	6:21:42	6:21:50	ok
334	6:22:46	6:22:54	three inches straight across
335	6:22:56	6:22:58	then
336	6:25:0	6:25:8	the slate mountain is towards the right
338	6:25:33	6:25:38	for like
339	6:25:42	6:25:51	and there s a plane crash
340	6:25:58	6:26:5	IY just kind of slope down
342	6:29:5	6:29:11	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
start f
5	0:1:45	0:1:49	oh
6	0:2:50	0:2:56	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
8	0:3:40	0:3:48	ok
9	0:4:37	0:4:41	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
11	0:7:10	0:7:10	mm hmm
12	0:8:41	0:8:46	so IY go to the left of the antelope
13	0:9:16	0:9:24	ok
17	0:12:9	0:12:13	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
21	0:16:3	0:16:8	mm hmm
25	0:22:48	0:22:50	ok
30	0:28:4	0:28:11	mm hmm
32	0:28:39	0:28:41	IY hit some round rocks

59	0:53:50	0:53:58	yeah
62	0:55:2	0:55:8	to the left of the antelope
76	1:10:59	1:11:3	and to the right 
78	1:16:56	1:17:0	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
84	1:23:16	1:23:21	ok
87	1:26:50	1:26:57	ok
88	1:28:18	1:28:22	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
90	1:32:4	1:32:12	do IY go by the plane crash 
96	1:39:20	1:39:22	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
97	1:39:24	1:39:31	 IY m at the savannah
107	1:54:29	1:54:38	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
114	2:3:16	2:3:22	ok
116	2:4:31	2:4:32	around the lake to the top 
120	2:8:49	2:8:55	yeah IY see that
122	2:9:12	2:9:18	ok
127	2:13:15	2:13:20	ok

169	3:12:31	3:12:33	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
172	3:18:29	3:18:34	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
173	3:18:42	3:18:51	ok wait hold on
176	3:22:2	3:22:9	yeah
178	3:22:51	3:22:58	nope

230	4:23:11	4:23:13	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
246	4:35:59	4:36:3	yeah
248	4:37:5	4:37:9	mm hmm
251	4:40:12	4:40:17	ok
257	4:52:4	4:52:9	do IY go through anything 
260	4:53:49	4:53:49	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
266	4:59:17	4:59:19	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
267	4:59:45	4:59:45	and
269	5:1:7	5:1:13	ok
274	5:7:51	5:7:53	elephants

289	5:22:31	5:22:36	ok
291	5:25:35	5:25:43	IY m three inches above the savannah
294	5:29:14	5:29:23	ok
299	5:39:6	5:39:15	IY know IY have different things so
301	5:40:59	5:41:5	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
302	5:43:4	5:43:4	IY ve a plane crash though
311	5:56:14	5:56:23	ok
313	5:56:32	5:56:41	yeah 
314	5:57:2	5:57:8	yeah

318	6:1:25	6:1:32	yep
321	6:7:46	6:7:54	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
324	6:10:28	6:10:28	mm  mm
330	6:17:43	6:17:49	mm hmm
337	6:25:17	6:25:17	to the right 
341	6:29:0	6:29:7	ok
start g
0	0:0:16	0:0:23	yes
1	0:0:47	0:0:50	about like
2	0:0:58	0:1:1	uhm
3	0:0:57	0:1:6	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
4	0:1:15	0:1:23	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
7	0:3:10	0:3:14	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
10	0:5:1	0:5:7	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
14	0:9:59	0:10:0	just a slight slope
15	0:10:31	0:10:38	and then IY ll come to a savannah
16	0:11:4	0:11:5	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
18	0:15:31	0:15:31	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
19	0:15:40	0:15:40	like
20	0:16:3	0:16:5	three inches
22	0:16:56	0:17:3	uhm
23	0:18:5	0:18:7	so
24	0:18:12	0:18:20	and is to the left
26	0:23:43	0:23:46	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
27	0:24:37	0:24:43	uhm
28	0:27:29	0:27:35	and then
29	0:27:33	0:27:42	maybe four inches on the paper
31	0:28:29	0:28:37	ok
34	0:29:1	0:29:4	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
35	0:29:33	0:29:39	five
36	0:31:50	0:31:56	uhm
37	0:32:4	0:32:7	ok
38	0:32:30	0:32:30	like four or five inches to the left
39	0:33:14	0:33:19	maybe IY have different things
40	0:33:45	0:33:47	ok well
41	0:34:37	0:34:42	just do it like this ok
42	0:35:21	0:35:22	after that IY go straight again
43	0:36:40	0:36:42	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
44	0:36:45	0:36:53	where IY re going down to a plane crash
45	0:38:16	0:38:19	well
46	0:38:37	0:38:39	IY wanna kind of curve
48	0:43:9	0:43:17	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
49	0:44:6	0:44:6	and
50	0:44:25	0:44:28	to IY right 
51	0:45:10	0:45:19	uhm
52	0:45:23	0:45:32	what 
53	0:46:31	0:46:40	no

55	0:47:39	0:47:46	and then IY  IY go up
56	0:49:55	0:50:3	like three inches 
57	0:52:5	0:52:12	IY re kind of going  
58	0:53:21	0:53:21	uhm
60	0:53:49	0:53:58	for like
61	0:54:22	0:54:26	to the left
63	0:55:37	0:55:39	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
64	0:57:8	0:57:13	IY re at the plane crash
65	0:57:16	0:57:19	ok
66	1:0:19	1:0:20	well alright
67	1:0:25	1:0:33	are IY anywere near there 
68	1:0:29	1:0:38	a quarter of an inch
69	1:1:29	1:1:37	and IY slope is about an inch long
70	1:5:4	1:5:12	around the bottom of it
71	1:6:30	1:6:32	like an inch
72	1:8:8	1:8:16	to the lake 
73	1:8:25	1:8:30	and that s where the plane crash is
74	1:9:26	1:9:34	and 
75	1:10:34	1:10:36	uhm
77	1:12:24	1:12:27	uhm
79	1:18:10	1:18:18	not right at the stony desert
80	1:18:12	1:18:20	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
81	1:20:33	1:20:41	ok
82	1:21:59	1:22:3	alright are IY starting  near the  
83	1:22:49	1:22:57	after IY slope down IY d say
85	1:24:17	1:24:18	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
86	1:24:34	1:24:37	but
89	1:30:9	1:30:10	they re there
91	1:33:37	1:33:41	maybe

93	1:34:50	1:34:54	ok
94	1:35:51	1:35:56	couple inches IY re sloping down
95	1:39:2	1:39:6	and IY re sloping to the left
98	1:44:31	1:44:34	ok
99	1:46:26	1:46:28	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
100	1:46:41	1:46:43	IY re just going down
101	1:47:29	1:47:36	ok
102	1:47:38	1:47:41	there s a there s  
103	1:48:14	1:48:16	hmm
104	1:48:43	1:48:48	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
105	1:48:56	1:49:4	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
106	1:52:57	1:52:59	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
108	1:55:12	1:55:14	uhm
109	1:55:12	1:55:15	on IY sheet anyway
110	1:56:13	1:56:16	alright well IY ll keep going and see
111	2:0:21	2:0:23	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
112	2:1:45	2:1:54	ok
113	2:2:50	2:2:55	it s not a big curve
115	2:4:7	2:4:15	and IY should have a straight line there
117	2:4:33	2:4:34	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
118	2:8:1	2:8:9	uhm
119	2:8:30	2:8:35	IY plane crash 
121	2:9:8	2:9:10	and
123	2:10:22	2:10:22	you
124	2:11:48	2:11:56	ok well

133	2:28:10	2:28:14	ok
135	2:29:24	2:29:25	IY make
137	2:32:49	2:32:49	couple miles or something
139	2:34:23	2:34:23	IY would say
140	2:35:42	2:35:50	uhm
141	2:37:35	2:37:42	and IY go to the left a little bit
142	2:42:0	2:42:5	so IY re at the hot springs
144	2:44:46	2:44:50	so IY go three inches straight
146	2:46:23	2:46:25	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
147	2:46:47	2:46:47	and then IY slope down to the left
148	2:47:28	2:47:34	and then IY re going down
149	2:47:43	2:47:49	maybe like
151	2:52:32	2:52:36	ok

154	2:54:3	2:54:7	yes
155	2:55:50	2:55:55	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
157	2:56:49	2:56:51	uhm
158	2:59:29	2:59:32	alright alright well just
161	3:2:13	3:2:13	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything

164	3:7:25	3:7:26	IY re going like
165	3:7:55	3:7:59	and IY re going up like
166	3:8:8	3:8:13	ok
167	3:8:48	3:8:51	ok IY plane crash isn t there
168	3:8:48	3:8:51	IY slope down again
170	3:14:16	3:14:20	ok
171	3:17:31	3:17:33	like
174	3:20:58	3:21:2	to the left
175	3:21:2	3:21:8	IY re actually starting like right
177	3:22:6	3:22:10	and then
181	3:25:48	3:25:57	ok
182	3:27:18	3:27:26	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
183	3:28:6	3:28:13	a little
184	3:28:45	3:28:47	alright 
186	3:29:44	3:29:50	and 
187	3:30:7	3:30:15	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
188	3:34:0	3:34:0	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
189	3:34:10	3:34:10	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
194	3:40:2	3:40:3	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
195	3:41:15	3:41:23	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
196	3:44:32	3:44:34	IY re sloping
198	3:47:27	3:47:29	ok
199	3:48:54	3:48:54	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
200	3:49:31	3:49:37	kind of across from stony desert
201	3:50:6	3:50:9	uhhh no
202	3:51:25	3:51:29	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
203	3:52:39	3:52:41	no IY have  
204	3:53:42	3:53:48	and then IY slope up
205	3:54:17	3:54:21	and then
207	3:55:4	3:55:7	like
208	3:55:15	3:55:20	do IY have roman baths 
210	4:5:24	4:5:24	the  
211	4:6:30	4:6:31	and IY re going straight up
212	4:6:32	4:6:36	uhm
217	4:10:9	4:10:15	an inch maybe a little bit less
219	4:11:7	4:11:12	what 
220	4:11:12	4:11:15	and then
221	4:11:15	4:11:21	so IY make that circle
222	4:11:22	4:11:26	straight up
223	4:11:24	4:11:26	like IY re sloping
224	4:12:41	4:12:47	IY re going about
225	4:12:53	4:13:1	are IY anywhere near there 
226	4:17:41	4:17:42	and it slopes a little bit to the right
227	4:18:25	4:18:27	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
228	4:21:42	4:21:43	are IY  
229	4:22:20	4:22:23	IY don t know
231	4:24:16	4:24:23	and then
232	4:25:19	4:25:19	well
233	4:27:4	4:27:7	ok
234	4:28:15	4:28:19	ok IY re at the savannah
235	4:28:39	4:28:39	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
236	4:29:5	4:29:6	uhm
237	4:29:58	4:30:7	after plane crash
238	4:32:1	4:32:9	no IY don t have any rocks
239	4:33:14	4:33:15	IY re starting
240	4:33:9	4:33:17	ok
241	4:33:13	4:33:20	no
242	4:34:47	4:34:52	that s about five or six inches
243	4:35:7	4:35:8	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
244	4:35:8	4:35:16	well just
245	4:35:48	4:35:56	are IY in like almost the top of the
247	4:37:0	4:37:2	go up like three  three and a half inches
249	4:38:2	4:38:2	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
250	4:40:12	4:40:13	IY move to the left
252	4:40:54	4:41:2	uhm
253	4:43:26	4:43:34	ok 
254	4:47:45	4:47:46	ok
255	4:48:22	4:48:28	IY go straight down
256	4:51:41	4:51:49	four or five inches to the left
258	4:52:7	4:52:11	to the right
259	4:53:10	4:53:11	have a s 
261	4:54:33	4:54:39	no IY don t have a waterhole
262	4:54:47	4:54:48	and IY re going
263	4:54:53	4:54:55	uhm
264	4:56:27	4:56:30	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
265	4:57:7	4:57:9	ok
268	5:0:29	5:0:36	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
270	5:4:31	5:4:39	no there s no elephants
271	5:4:34	5:4:42	to the white mountain
272	5:6:11	5:6:15	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
273	5:6:36	5:6:41	ok and then IY re going
277	5:9:57	5:10:2	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
278	5:10:13	5:10:16	and then
279	5:15:24	5:15:32	for about two inches
280	5:16:20	5:16:25	maybe like
281	5:17:12	5:17:16	are IY in like   
282	5:17:18	5:17:23	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
285	5:21:6	5:21:12	from
286	5:21:11	5:21:14	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
287	5:21:36	5:21:42	a little bit too
290	5:25:1	5:25:4	and then
292	5:27:25	5:27:32	yes IY re going towards the lake
293	5:28:48	5:28:57	uhm and there is a stony desert
295	5:30:33	5:30:38	it s right next to it
296	5:32:11	5:32:16	uh like
297	5:32:36	5:32:40	that s IY little slope
298	5:36:16	5:36:18	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
300	5:40:2	5:40:5	and then IY slope
303	5:43:5	5:43:5	ok
304	5:43:37	5:43:42	three inches
305	5:44:0	5:44:1	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
306	5:47:48	5:47:55	uhm
307	5:47:57	5:47:59	so anyway
308	5:51:45	5:51:48	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
309	5:55:10	5:55:13	probably the same thing
310	5:56:7	5:56:12	to the left
312	5:56:30	5:56:34	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
315	5:57:7	5:57:16	and then IY go straight
317	5:58:46	5:58:49	slight
319	6:6:16	6:6:23	is the plane crash  
320	6:6:40	6:6:46	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
322	6:8:38	6:8:45	after the circle
323	6:8:41	6:8:45	ok
325	6:10:51	6:10:58	ok
326	6:10:58	6:11:5	and then
327	6:13:35	6:13:39	IY re starting at the stony desert
328	6:16:9	6:16:11	and IY go down IY slope to the right
