0:0:16	0:0:23	g	yes
0:0:47	0:0:50	g	about like
0:0:58	0:1:1	g	uhm
0:0:57	0:1:6	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
0:1:15	0:1:23	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
0:1:45	0:1:49	f	oh
0:2:50	0:2:56	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
0:3:10	0:3:14	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
0:3:40	0:3:48	f	ok
0:4:37	0:4:41	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
0:5:1	0:5:7	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
0:7:10	0:7:10	f	mm hmm
0:8:41	0:8:46	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
0:9:16	0:9:24	f	ok
0:9:59	0:10:0	g	just a slight slope
0:10:31	0:10:38	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
0:11:4	0:11:5	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
0:12:9	0:12:13	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
0:15:31	0:15:31	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
0:15:40	0:15:40	g	like
0:16:3	0:16:5	g	three inches
0:16:3	0:16:8	f	mm hmm

0:22:48	0:22:50	f	ok
0:23:43	0:23:46	g	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
0:24:37	0:24:43	g	uhm
0:27:29	0:27:35	g	and then
0:27:33	0:27:42	g	maybe four inches on the paper
0:28:4	0:28:11	f	mm hmm
0:28:29	0:28:37	g	ok
0:28:39	0:28:41	f	IY hit some round rocks
0:29:0	0:29:3	f	IY go to a lake 
0:29:1	0:29:4	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
0:29:33	0:29:39	g	five
0:31:50	0:31:56	g	uhm
0:32:4	0:32:7	g	ok
0:32:30	0:32:30	g	like four or five inches to the left
0:33:14	0:33:19	g	maybe IY have different things
0:33:45	0:33:47	g	ok well
0:34:37	0:34:42	g	just do it like this ok
0:35:21	0:35:22	g	after that IY go straight again
0:36:40	0:36:42	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
0:36:45	0:36:53	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
0:38:16	0:38:19	g	well
0:38:37	0:38:39	g	IY wanna kind of curve
0:42:19	0:42:19	f	uh IY don t know know what to say
0:43:9	0:43:17	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
0:44:6	0:44:6	g	and
0:44:25	0:44:28	g	to IY right 
0:45:10	0:45:19	g	uhm
0:45:23	0:45:32	g	what 
0:46:31	0:46:40	g	no
0:46:36	0:46:41	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
0:47:39	0:47:46	g	and then IY  IY go up
0:49:55	0:50:3	g	like three inches 
0:52:5	0:52:12	g	IY re kind of going  
0:53:21	0:53:21	g	uhm
0:53:50	0:53:58	f	yeah
0:53:49	0:53:58	g	for like
0:54:22	0:54:26	g	to the left
0:55:2	0:55:8	f	to the left of the antelope
0:55:37	0:55:39	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
0:57:8	0:57:13	g	IY re at the plane crash
0:57:16	0:57:19	g	ok
1:0:19	1:0:20	g	well alright
1:0:25	1:0:33	g	are IY anywere near there 
1:0:29	1:0:38	g	a quarter of an inch
1:1:29	1:1:37	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
1:5:4	1:5:12	g	around the bottom of it
1:6:30	1:6:32	g	like an inch
1:8:8	1:8:16	g	to the lake 
1:8:25	1:8:30	g	and that s where the plane crash is
1:9:26	1:9:34	g	and 
1:10:34	1:10:36	g	uhm
1:10:59	1:11:3	f	and to the right 
1:12:24	1:12:27	g	uhm
1:16:56	1:17:0	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
1:18:10	1:18:18	g	not right at the stony desert
1:18:12	1:18:20	g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
1:20:33	1:20:41	g	ok
1:21:59	1:22:3	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
1:22:49	1:22:57	g	after IY slope down IY d say
1:23:16	1:23:21	f	ok
1:24:17	1:24:18	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
1:24:34	1:24:37	g	but
1:26:50	1:26:57	f	ok
1:28:18	1:28:22	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
1:30:9	1:30:10	g	they re there
1:32:4	1:32:12	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
1:33:37	1:33:41	g	maybe
1:34:30	1:34:36	g	IY got that 
1:34:50	1:34:54	g	ok
1:35:51	1:35:56	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
1:39:2	1:39:6	g	and IY re sloping to the left
1:39:20	1:39:22	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
1:39:24	1:39:31	f	 IY m at the savannah
1:44:31	1:44:34	g	ok
1:46:26	1:46:28	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
1:46:41	1:46:43	g	IY re just going down
1:47:29	1:47:36	g	ok
1:47:38	1:47:41	g	there s a there s  
1:48:14	1:48:16	g	hmm
1:48:43	1:48:48	g	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
1:48:56	1:49:4	g	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
1:52:57	1:52:59	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
1:54:29	1:54:38	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
1:55:12	1:55:14	g	uhm
1:55:12	1:55:15	g	on IY sheet anyway
1:56:13	1:56:16	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
2:0:21	2:0:23	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
2:1:45	2:1:54	g	ok
2:2:50	2:2:55	g	it s not a big curve
2:3:16	2:3:22	f	ok
2:4:7	2:4:15	g	and IY should have a straight line there
2:4:31	2:4:32	f	around the lake to the top 
2:4:33	2:4:34	g	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
2:8:1	2:8:9	g	uhm
2:8:30	2:8:35	g	IY plane crash 
2:8:49	2:8:55	f	yeah IY see that
2:9:8	2:9:10	g	and
2:9:12	2:9:18	f	ok

2:20:16	2:20:16	g	ok
2:22:41	2:22:45	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert

2:28:50	2:28:57	f	and then what 
2:29:24	2:29:25	g	IY make

2:35:42	2:35:50	g	uhm
2:37:35	2:37:42	g	and IY go to the left a little bit
2:42:0	2:42:5	g	so IY re at the hot springs
2:43:46	2:43:48	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
2:44:46	2:44:50	g	so IY go three inches straight
2:45:38	2:45:39	f	how many inches do IY think 
2:46:23	2:46:25	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
2:46:47	2:46:47	g	and then IY slope down to the left
2:47:28	2:47:34	g	and then IY re going down
2:47:43	2:47:49	g	maybe like
2:51:34	2:51:39	f	uhm my
2:52:32	2:52:36	g	ok

2:54:3	2:54:7	g	yes
2:55:50	2:55:55	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
2:56:36	2:56:39	f	do IY go around it 
2:56:49	2:56:51	g	uhm
2:59:29	2:59:32	g	alright alright well just
2:59:41	2:59:47	f	nope IY have a white mountain

3:7:25	3:7:26	g	IY re going like
3:7:55	3:7:59	g	and IY re going up like
3:8:8	3:8:13	g	ok
3:8:48	3:8:51	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
3:8:48	3:8:51	g	IY slope down again
3:12:31	3:12:33	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
3:14:16	3:14:20	g	ok
3:17:31	3:17:33	g	like
3:18:29	3:18:34	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
3:18:42	3:18:51	f	ok wait hold on
3:20:58	3:21:2	g	to the left
3:21:2	3:21:8	g	IY re actually starting like right

3:22:6	3:22:10	g	and then
3:22:51	3:22:58	f	nope
3:24:16	3:24:23	f	around the top of the lake 
3:25:43	3:25:45	f	to 
3:25:48	3:25:57	g	ok
3:27:18	3:27:26	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
3:28:6	3:28:13	g	a little
3:28:45	3:28:47	g	alright 
3:29:31	3:29:39	f	ok
3:29:44	3:29:50	g	and 
3:30:7	3:30:15	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
3:34:0	3:34:0	g	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
3:34:10	3:34:10	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
3:36:36	3:36:45	f	yeah
3:39:38	3:39:43	f	up tp the right
3:39:54	3:39:54	f	IY have to back up a little bit
3:40:3	3:40:3	f	ok
3:40:2	3:40:3	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
3:41:15	3:41:23	g	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
3:44:32	3:44:34	g	IY re sloping
3:46:54	3:46:54	f	to the left
3:47:27	3:47:29	g	ok
3:48:54	3:48:54	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
3:49:31	3:49:37	g	kind of across from stony desert
3:50:6	3:50:9	g	uhhh no
3:51:25	3:51:29	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
3:52:39	3:52:41	g	no IY have  
3:53:42	3:53:48	g	and then IY slope up
3:54:17	3:54:21	g	and then
3:54:15	3:54:23	f	and curve down to the left 
3:55:4	3:55:7	g	like
3:55:15	3:55:20	g	do IY have roman baths 
4:3:57	4:3:59	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
4:5:24	4:5:24	g	the  
4:6:30	4:6:31	g	and IY re going straight up
4:6:32	4:6:36	g	uhm

4:10:9	4:10:15	g	an inch maybe a little bit less
4:11:2	4:11:5	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
4:11:7	4:11:12	g	what 
4:11:12	4:11:15	g	and then
4:11:15	4:11:21	g	so IY make that circle
4:11:22	4:11:26	g	straight up
4:11:24	4:11:26	g	like IY re sloping
4:12:41	4:12:47	g	IY re going about
4:12:53	4:13:1	g	are IY anywhere near there 
4:17:41	4:17:42	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
4:18:25	4:18:27	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
4:21:42	4:21:43	g	are IY  
4:22:20	4:22:23	g	IY don t know
4:23:11	4:23:13	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that

4:25:19	4:25:19	g	well
4:27:4	4:27:7	g	ok
4:28:15	4:28:19	g	ok IY re at the savannah
4:28:39	4:28:39	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
4:29:5	4:29:6	g	uhm
4:29:58	4:30:7	g	after plane crash
4:32:1	4:32:9	g	no IY don t have any rocks
4:33:14	4:33:15	g	IY re starting
4:33:9	4:33:17	g	ok
4:33:13	4:33:20	g	no
4:34:47	4:34:52	g	that s about five or six inches
4:35:7	4:35:8	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
4:35:8	4:35:16	g	well just
4:35:48	4:35:56	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
4:35:59	4:36:3	f	yeah
4:37:0	4:37:2	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
4:37:5	4:37:9	f	mm hmm
4:38:2	4:38:2	g	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
4:40:12	4:40:13	g	IY move to the left
4:40:12	4:40:17	f	ok
4:40:54	4:41:2	g	uhm
4:43:26	4:43:34	g	ok 
4:47:45	4:47:46	g	ok
4:48:22	4:48:28	g	IY go straight down
4:51:41	4:51:49	g	four or five inches to the left
4:52:4	4:52:9	f	do IY go through anything 
4:52:7	4:52:11	g	to the right
4:53:10	4:53:11	g	have a s 
4:53:49	4:53:49	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
4:54:33	4:54:39	g	no IY don t have a waterhole
4:54:47	4:54:48	g	and IY re going
4:54:53	4:54:55	g	uhm
4:56:27	4:56:30	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
4:57:7	4:57:9	g	ok
4:59:17	4:59:19	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
4:59:45	4:59:45	f	and
5:0:29	5:0:36	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
5:1:7	5:1:13	f	ok
5:4:31	5:4:39	g	no there s no elephants
5:4:34	5:4:42	g	to the white mountain
5:6:11	5:6:15	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
5:6:36	5:6:41	g	ok and then IY re going
5:7:51	5:7:53	f	elephants 
5:8:14	5:8:22	f	ok
5:9:57	5:10:0	f	ok
5:9:57	5:10:2	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
5:10:13	5:10:16	g	and then
5:15:24	5:15:32	g	for about two inches
5:16:20	5:16:25	g	maybe like
5:17:12	5:17:16	g	are IY in like   
5:17:18	5:17:23	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
5:19:35	5:19:38	f	yeah and IY went straight up
5:19:58	5:20:7	f	ok
5:21:6	5:21:12	g	from
5:21:11	5:21:14	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
5:21:36	5:21:42	g	a little bit too
5:22:18	5:22:22	f	ok
5:22:31	5:22:36	f	ok
5:25:1	5:25:4	g	and then
5:25:35	5:25:43	f	IY m three inches above the savannah
5:27:25	5:27:32	g	yes IY re going towards the lake
5:28:48	5:28:57	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
5:29:14	5:29:23	f	ok
5:30:33	5:30:38	g	it s right next to it
5:32:11	5:32:16	g	uh like
5:32:36	5:32:40	g	that s IY little slope
5:36:16	5:36:18	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
5:39:6	5:39:15	f	IY know IY have different things so
5:40:2	5:40:5	g	and then IY slope
5:40:59	5:41:5	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
5:43:4	5:43:4	f	IY ve a plane crash though
5:43:5	5:43:5	g	ok
5:43:37	5:43:42	g	three inches
5:44:0	5:44:1	g	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
5:47:48	5:47:55	g	uhm
5:47:57	5:47:59	g	so anyway
5:51:45	5:51:48	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
5:55:10	5:55:13	g	probably the same thing
5:56:7	5:56:12	g	to the left
