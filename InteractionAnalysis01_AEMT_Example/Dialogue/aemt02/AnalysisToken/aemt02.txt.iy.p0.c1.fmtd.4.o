start
0:0:18	0:0:26	g	IY re going like
0:1:45	0:1:45	g	no
0:1:56	0:2:5	f	around the lake to the top 
0:2:27	0:2:31	g	ok
0:2:55	0:3:2	f	ok
0:4:57	0:4:57	f	how many inches do IY think 
0:7:17	0:7:17	g	and IY re sloping to the left
0:8:48	0:8:48	g	to the left
0:9:43	0:9:49	g	no IY don t have any rocks
0:10:19	0:10:25	g	ok
0:11:23	0:11:24	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
0:11:46	0:11:53	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
0:12:7	0:12:14	f	yeah 
0:12:54	0:13:0	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
0:14:42	0:14:49	g	and IY should have a straight line there
0:14:50	0:14:51	g	well alright
0:16:49	0:16:49	g	ok
0:17:23	0:17:29	g	like maybe an inch
0:17:55	0:17:57	g	and then IY go straight
0:17:57	0:17:57	f	ok
0:20:3	0:20:4	g	and then
0:20:5	0:20:10	g	no IY have  
0:20:8	0:20:10	g	ok
0:20:26	0:20:34	f	and curve down to the left 
0:20:55	0:20:57	g	no there s no elephants
0:22:16	0:22:21	g	about like
0:22:56	0:23:2	g	uhm
0:23:38	0:23:43	g	and then IY slope up

0:26:59	0:27:1	g	uhm
0:27:8	0:27:14	g	and 
0:28:3	0:28:4	g	the  
0:28:9	0:28:12	g	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
0:30:25	0:30:33	g	alright alright well just
0:31:24	0:31:33	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
0:33:14	0:33:23	f	 IY m at the savannah
0:33:21	0:33:29	g	no IY don t have a waterhole
0:33:38	0:33:40	g	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
0:33:43	0:33:44	g	three inches straight across
0:37:17	0:37:22	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
0:39:46	0:39:49	g	IY re actually starting like right
0:39:49	0:39:58	f	yeah
0:42:1	0:42:7	g	uh like
0:46:0	0:46:8	g	uhm
0:47:6	0:47:7	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
0:48:4	0:48:12	f	yeah
0:48:40	0:48:49	g	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
0:54:39	0:54:42	g	IY re sloping
0:55:14	0:55:18	f	mm hmm
0:58:1	0:58:8	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
0:58:28	0:58:32	g	uhhh no
0:58:51	0:58:59	g	IY re kind of going  
0:59:19	0:59:19	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
1:0:3	1:0:3	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
1:2:28	1:2:29	g	IY re at the plane crash
1:2:42	1:2:48	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
1:3:33	1:3:34	f	IY ve a plane crash though
1:3:55	1:3:59	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
1:5:36	1:5:43	g	and 
1:7:20	1:7:22	f	ok
1:7:17	1:7:25	g	yes IY re going towards the lake
1:8:13	1:8:17	f	to 
1:8:21	1:8:26	g	maybe like
1:9:14	1:9:23	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
1:10:59	1:11:0	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
1:11:23	1:11:32	f	around the top of the lake 
1:12:5	1:12:11	f	to the left
1:13:3	1:13:3	g	ok
1:13:23	1:13:26	f	and to the right 
1:14:32	1:14:33	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
1:14:56	1:15:1	f	uh IY don t know know what to say
1:16:16	1:16:16	g	just a slight slope
1:16:19	1:16:19	f	ok
1:16:18	1:16:23	f	ok
1:16:57	1:17:4	g	ok and then IY re going
1:17:39	1:17:48	g	IY re starting at the stony desert
1:17:53	1:17:58	g	and then
1:20:37	1:20:43	g	and then
1:21:31	1:21:31	g	ok
1:22:19	1:22:24	g	are IY  
1:23:50	1:23:51	f	yeah
1:24:2	1:24:11	g	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
1:25:12	1:25:12	g	after the circle
1:27:34	1:27:40	g	uhm
1:28:36	1:28:40	g	ok
1:28:44	1:28:51	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
1:29:13	1:29:14	g	and then
1:31:22	1:31:22	g	IY slope down again
1:33:21	1:33:28	f	IY hit some round rocks
1:34:32	1:34:35	g	IY don t know
1:35:16	1:35:24	g	but
1:35:40	1:35:48	g	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
1:35:56	1:36:2	g	uhm
1:36:54	1:37:2	g	ok
1:37:47	1:37:55	f	and

1:40:43	1:40:51	g	uhm
1:41:35	1:41:40	f	do IY go around it 
1:43:20	1:43:27	g	so
1:44:28	1:44:28	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
1:48:36	1:48:41	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
1:50:15	1:50:17	f	to the right 
1:50:46	1:50:53	g	and IY just go straight up
1:50:52	1:50:56	g	like IY re sloping
1:51:16	1:51:23	g	like four or five inches to the left
1:53:33	1:53:41	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
1:54:16	1:54:17	f	oh
1:54:41	1:54:49	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
1:56:2	1:56:3	f	and then what 
1:58:4	1:58:9	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
1:58:9	1:58:14	g	a quarter of an inch
1:58:57	1:59:1	g	after that IY go straight again
2:0:10	2:0:14	g	for about two inches
2:0:39	2:0:40	f	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
2:1:10	2:1:17	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
2:1:16	2:1:25	g	what 
2:1:41	2:1:50	g	have a s 
2:2:31	2:2:33	f	ok
2:2:43	2:2:45	g	is the plane crash  
2:2:50	2:2:50	g	so anyway
2:3:45	2:3:54	g	and then IY re going down
2:4:0	2:4:2	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
2:3:59	2:4:8	f	IY go to a lake 
2:4:16	2:4:16	f	ok
2:7:32	2:7:33	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
2:8:39	2:8:43	f	ok
2:9:55	2:10:0	g	after IY slope down IY d say
2:10:14	2:10:20	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
2:11:52	2:11:56	g	a little
2:14:48	2:14:51	g	IY wanna kind of curve
2:15:21	2:15:29	g	ok 
2:15:42	2:15:44	g	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
2:15:40	2:15:46	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
2:16:29	2:16:36	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
2:16:46	2:16:53	g	are IY anywhere near there 
2:17:54	2:17:56	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
2:19:53	2:19:53	g	uhm
2:20:18	2:20:27	g	IY re starting
2:21:17	2:21:24	f	mm hmm
2:22:47	2:22:52	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
2:23:24	2:23:28	g	so IY make that circle
2:25:56	2:25:59	f	IY have to back up a little bit
2:26:9	2:26:12	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
2:26:29	2:26:31	g	five
2:28:27	2:28:30	g	from
2:30:9	2:30:9	g	well
2:30:25	2:30:33	f	mm hmm
2:31:44	2:31:50	g	well
2:31:53	2:32:0	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
2:31:58	2:32:4	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
2:33:55	2:33:56	g	and then
2:34:31	2:34:31	g	like three inches 
2:35:39	2:35:45	g	to the white mountain
2:35:49	2:35:57	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
2:36:57	2:37:4	g	and then IY go
2:39:19	2:39:19	f	ok
2:39:21	2:39:27	g	an inch maybe a little bit less
2:40:16	2:40:21	g	it s right next to it
2:40:13	2:40:22	g	uhm
2:40:34	2:40:34	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
2:42:24	2:42:31	f	yeah 
2:42:45	2:42:45	f	ok
2:43:4	2:43:7	g	IY just kind of slope down
2:43:45	2:43:45	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
2:44:37	2:44:38	g	to the right
2:45:53	2:45:53	g	ok
2:50:0	2:50:2	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
2:50:3	2:50:7	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
2:50:30	2:50:38	g	so that s about IY would say
2:52:22	2:52:27	g	like
2:54:10	2:54:15	f	ok
2:56:8	2:56:17	g	ok
2:56:45	2:56:48	g	just do it like this ok
2:57:27	2:57:29	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
2:57:37	2:57:37	g	ok
2:57:33	2:57:39	g	and then IY slope
2:59:38	2:59:47	f	ok
3:0:14	3:0:22	g	three inches
3:1:42	3:1:49	g	IY got that 
3:2:47	3:2:56	g	ok
3:3:25	3:3:27	g	uhm
3:4:27	3:4:34	g	and that s where the plane crash is
3:5:35	3:5:42	g	and there s a plane crash
3:6:24	3:6:33	f	uhm my
3:10:6	3:10:6	g	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
3:10:41	3:10:43	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
3:10:41	3:10:50	g	uhm
3:10:50	3:10:52	f	nope IY have a white mountain
3:11:46	3:11:51	f	ok
3:19:7	3:19:7	f	to the left of the antelope
3:20:3	3:20:11	f	ok
3:22:5	3:22:6	g	ok
3:22:19	3:22:21	f	mm hmm
3:23:23	3:23:25	g	they re there
3:25:14	3:25:17	g	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
3:26:20	3:26:26	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
3:26:26	3:26:28	f	ok
3:27:40	3:27:46	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
3:27:54	3:28:0	g	ok
3:29:45	3:29:52	g	do IY have roman baths 
3:30:12	3:30:14	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
3:32:40	3:32:48	g	ok
3:34:38	3:34:41	f	IY know IY have different things so
3:37:35	3:37:42	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
3:39:31	3:39:32	g	and then
3:39:40	3:39:46	g	probably the same thing
3:43:29	3:43:30	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
3:44:49	3:44:49	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
3:45:10	3:45:18	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
3:48:41	3:48:46	g	couple miles or something
3:49:51	3:49:51	g	and then IY  IY go up
3:50:17	3:50:23	g	ok
3:50:53	3:51:1	g	IY move to the left
3:55:36	3:55:44	g	IY would say
3:57:35	3:57:38	g	ok
3:57:52	3:58:0	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
3:58:16	3:58:18	f	ok
4:0:17	4:0:21	g	and IY re going straight up
4:1:52	4:1:58	g	and is to the left
4:2:36	4:2:40	f	ok
4:4:41	4:4:46	g	ok
4:7:2	4:7:8	g	ok
4:8:32	4:8:40	g	ok
4:9:2	4:9:11	g	like an inch
4:13:14	4:13:17	g	uhm
4:13:42	4:13:42	g	straight up
4:14:37	4:14:41	g	uhm
4:15:36	4:15:37	g	ok
4:15:45	4:15:49	g	alright

4:25:43	4:25:52	g	like
4:26:27	4:26:32	f	mm hmm
4:26:26	4:26:33	f	ok
4:27:45	4:27:49	g	IY plane crash 
4:27:50	4:27:57	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
4:29:14	4:29:18	g	to IY right 
4:31:24	4:31:33	g	so IY go three inches straight
4:33:17	4:33:17	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
4:36:23	4:36:25	g	then
4:36:37	4:36:40	g	kind of across from stony desert
4:36:55	4:37:1	g	and then
4:37:20	4:37:28	g	are IY anywere near there 
4:38:54	4:39:0	g	maybe IY have different things
4:39:59	4:40:0	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
4:40:2	4:40:2	g	ok IY re at the savannah
4:40:34	4:40:38	g	IY go straight down
4:41:52	4:41:56	f	ok
4:43:16	4:43:20	g	slight
4:43:38	4:43:39	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
4:45:46	4:45:49	g	uhm
4:46:9	4:46:15	g	hmm
4:46:31	4:46:40	g	three inches
4:48:31	4:48:35	g	you
4:50:32	4:50:32	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
4:50:33	4:50:33	g	on IY sheet anyway
4:50:45	4:50:51	f	ok wait hold on
4:52:37	4:52:45	g	and IY re going
4:53:45	4:53:48	g	ok
4:53:54	4:53:55	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
4:54:13	4:54:19	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
4:54:23	4:54:29	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
4:54:43	4:54:47	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
4:55:51	4:55:55	g	no
4:56:42	4:56:42	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
4:57:45	4:57:52	g	well just
4:58:43	4:58:45	g	what 
5:2:49	5:2:53	f	ok
5:3:47	5:3:53	g	maybe like
5:5:6	5:5:9	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
5:6:47	5:6:47	g	for like
5:7:27	5:7:31	g	maybe
5:10:42	5:10:50	f	ok
5:13:14	5:13:22	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
5:15:49	5:15:58	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
5:16:1	5:16:7	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
5:18:32	5:18:37	f	do IY go through anything 
5:19:15	5:19:23	g	are IY in like   
5:21:46	5:21:50	g	around the bottom of it
5:23:29	5:23:32	g	IY re going about
5:24:5	5:24:5	g	and then IY are
5:24:52	5:25:1	g	and IY re going up like
5:25:14	5:25:18	f	yep
5:28:43	5:28:52	g	not right at the stony desert
5:33:54	5:34:1	g	to the lake 
5:34:44	5:34:49	g	to the left
5:38:56	5:38:57	g	and
5:42:7	5:42:9	g	and
5:43:21	5:43:30	g	for like
5:43:25	5:43:31	g	there s a there s  
5:46:18	5:46:25	g	uhm
5:47:59	5:48:5	g	and then
5:48:15	5:48:22	g	yes
5:49:15	5:49:21	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
5:49:46	5:49:46	f	ok
5:50:27	5:50:29	g	ok
5:51:6	5:51:8	f	so wait
5:53:27	5:53:28	f	yeah and IY went straight up
5:53:56	5:53:57	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
5:54:38	5:54:42	g	it s not a big curve
5:54:48	5:54:52	g	uhm
5:56:2	5:56:2	f	mm hmm
5:57:24	5:57:28	g	like
5:57:31	5:57:34	g	maybe four inches on the paper
5:57:57	5:57:58	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right
5:58:22	5:58:23	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
5:59:32	5:59:39	g	to the left
