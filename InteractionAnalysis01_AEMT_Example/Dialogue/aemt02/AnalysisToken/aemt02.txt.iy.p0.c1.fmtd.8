1:6:49	1:6:51	g	216	4011			right next to IY circle should be roman baths
1:10:40	1:10:47	g	302	4247			IY would say
1:11:42	1:11:45	g	122	4305			well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
1:11:46	1:11:47	g	206	4307			and

1:13:51	1:13:51	g	138	4431			and then right around the antelope IY take a right
1:13:47	1:13:54	g	43	4434			IY re going like
1:17:7	1:17:16	g	26	4636			uhm

1:18:29	1:18:30	g	151	4710			ok and then IY re going
1:21:15	1:21:15	g	15	4875			uhm
1:21:46	1:21:51	g	90	4911			just a slight slope
1:23:8	1:23:11	g	286	4991			but
1:23:21	1:23:21	f	194	5001			curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
1:24:13	1:24:14	g	165	5054			aways about like four inches  four or five inches
1:25:38	1:25:43	g	137	5143			straight up
1:27:28	1:27:34	g	87	5254			IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
1:29:19	1:29:20	g	177	5360			and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
1:29:25	1:29:26	f	342	5366			to 
1:29:38	1:29:41	f	204	5381			ok
1:29:43	1:29:44	f	220	5384			and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left

1:35:24	1:35:30	f	62	5730			but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
1:36:53	1:36:56	g	237	5816			and IY should have a straight line there
1:37:4	1:37:11	g	178	5831			and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
1:37:10	1:37:14	f	259	5834			uh IY don t know know what to say
1:37:45	1:37:50	g	214	5870			ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain

4:14:23	4:14:25	f	225	15265			mm hmm
4:14:33	4:14:35	g	32	15275			probably the same thing
4:15:57	4:16:0	g	39	15360			to IY right 
4:16:29	4:16:35	g	9	15395			IY re starting
4:22:58	4:23:7	g	299	15787			ok
4:24:11	4:24:14	g	65	15854			so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
4:24:45	4:24:50	f	113	15890			to the right 
4:24:51	4:24:54	g	22	15894			and IY go to the left a little bit
4:24:59	4:25:8	g	245	15908			what 
4:25:52	4:26:1	f	169	15961			ok
4:30:41	4:30:46	g	105	16246			no
4:30:39	4:30:48	g	280	16248			and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
4:32:20	4:32:25	f	17	16345			to the left of the antelope
4:32:38	4:32:46	g	121	16366			ok
4:34:29	4:34:29	g	306	16469			to the right

4:40:31	4:40:36	g	78	16836			ok
4:42:1	4:42:8	g	224	16928			IY re sloping
4:42:35	4:42:36	g	11	16956			IY re just going down
4:44:14	4:44:14	g	84	17054			ok

4:49:20	4:49:27	g	174	17367			and then
4:50:52	4:50:57	g	152	17457			three inches
4:51:2	4:51:3	g	243	17463			no there s no elephants
4:52:58	4:52:58	f	14	17578			do IY go by the plane crash 
4:53:30	4:53:35	f	55	17615			IY m three inches above the savannah
4:54:46	4:54:54	f	111	17694			ok

4:57:51	4:57:52	g	12	17872			four or five inches to the left
4:58:50	4:58:57	g	263	17937			so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
5:2:12	5:2:14	g	236	18134			IY re at the plane crash
5:3:49	5:3:50	g	97	18230			ok
5:6:7	5:6:11	g	153	18371			slight
5:7:56	5:7:58	g	67	18478			a little
5:9:15	5:9:22	g	85	18562			oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
5:10:32	5:10:34	g	192	18634			IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
5:11:4	5:11:12	g	186	18672			after the circle
5:12:51	5:13:0	g	167	18780			for like
5:14:39	5:14:45	f	176	18885			no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
5:14:47	5:14:51	f	340	18891			and curve down to the left 
5:17:43	5:17:45	f	242	19065			so IY pass a waterhole or no 
5:17:55	5:17:55	g	235	19075			as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
5:18:16	5:18:22	g	19	19102			and IY re sloping to the left
5:19:6	5:19:7	g	47	19147			maybe
5:24:7	5:24:7	f	74	19447			around the lake to the top 
5:25:44	5:25:47	g	82	19547			uhm
5:27:10	5:27:14	f	232	19634			ok

5:27:32	5:27:33	g	42	19653			yes IY re going towards the lake
5:29:7	5:29:14	g	134	19754			and then IY  IY go up
5:29:11	5:29:18	g	33	19758			in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
5:32:31	5:32:36	g	196	19956			yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
5:34:11	5:34:19	f	75	20059			IY have to back up a little bit
5:34:38	5:34:41	g	127	20081			like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
5:35:22	5:35:30	g	119	20130			and then
5:35:45	5:35:49	g	283	20149			and then
5:36:31	5:36:39	g	315	20199			alright well IY ll keep going and see
5:36:54	5:36:56	g	171	20216			and that s where the plane crash is
5:38:10	5:38:15	g	109	20295			uhm
5:43:6	5:43:8	f	271	20588			do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
5:43:31	5:43:38	g	207	20618			ok
5:43:58	5:43:59	g	267	20639			that s IY little slope
5:46:28	5:46:29	g	95	20789			now IY re at the collapsed shelter
5:47:4	5:47:12	g	91	20832			uhm
5:47:44	5:47:46	g	1	20866			maybe IY have different things

5:50:25	5:50:32	g	37	21032			ok IY re at the savannah
5:51:0	5:51:7	g	255	21067			so IY make that circle
5:51:15	5:51:22	g	80	21082			like four or five inches to the left
5:54:22	5:54:26	g	18	21266			ok
5:55:49	5:55:58	f	322	21358			ok

5:58:53	5:59:1	g	76	21541			that s about five or six inches
5:59:37	5:59:43	g	198	21583			alright alright well just
6:1:38	6:1:46	g	104	21706			and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
6:2:11	6:2:17	f	317	21737			IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
6:2:49	6:2:55	f	250	21775			yeah
6:2:50	6:2:57	g	239	21777			and it slopes a little bit to the right
6:3:10	6:3:10	f	150	21790			ok
6:3:29	6:3:32	g	281	21812			ok
6:6:41	6:6:50	g	4	22010			and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
6:7:24	6:7:29	f	110	22049			IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
6:7:25	6:7:30	g	71	22050			and curve to  not down just curve to the left
6:7:46	6:7:47	g	227	22067			and then IY re going down
6:9:25	6:9:30	g	28	22170			kind of across from stony desert
6:11:8	6:11:9	g	249	22269			yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
6:11:31	6:11:40	g	20	22300			and then IY go
6:12:40	6:12:42	g	88	22362			no IY don t have a waterhole
6:13:26	6:13:27	f	228	22407			how many inches do IY think 
6:16:58	6:17:5	f	308	22625			ok
6:18:20	6:18:20	f	208	22700			 IY m at the savannah
6:19:9	6:19:9	g	282	22749			maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
6:19:35	6:19:37	g	304	22777			where IY re going down to a plane crash
6:21:10	6:21:10	g	217	22870			ok 
6:21:38	6:21:42	f	34	22902			yeah

6:26:14	6:26:22	g	337	23182			it s not a big curve
6:26:25	6:26:30	g	189	23190			the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
6:26:30	6:26:35	g	154	23195			ok
6:28:29	6:28:32	g	144	23312			ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
