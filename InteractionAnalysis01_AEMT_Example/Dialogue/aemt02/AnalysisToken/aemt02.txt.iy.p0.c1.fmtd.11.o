start
0:0:12	0:0:15	g	uhm
0:1:2	0:1:5	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
0:2:16	0:2:24	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
0:2:27	0:2:28	g	do IY have roman baths 
0:2:56	0:3:2	g	uhm
0:3:4	0:3:11	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
0:5:25	0:5:30	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
0:6:1	0:6:5	g	ok
0:6:9	0:6:10	g	to the white mountain
0:7:51	0:8:0	g	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
0:8:23	0:8:23	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
0:12:13	0:12:13	g	IY make
0:12:23	0:12:29	g	uhm
0:13:45	0:13:53	g	after that IY go straight again
0:13:47	0:13:55	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
0:14:10	0:14:14	g	a little bit too
0:16:50	0:16:57	f	and curve down to the left 
0:19:16	0:19:23	g	hmm
0:20:2	0:20:3	g	straight up
0:20:30	0:20:33	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
0:20:57	0:21:3	g	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
0:22:36	0:22:40	g	an inch maybe a little bit less
0:23:26	0:23:32	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
0:24:0	0:24:7	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
0:26:14	0:26:23	g	not right at the stony desert
0:26:51	0:26:55	f	IY know IY have different things so
0:26:58	0:27:2	g	then
0:27:37	0:27:40	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
0:28:20	0:28:27	g	ok
0:31:34	0:31:43	g	and then IY slope
0:31:38	0:31:46	f	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
0:31:48	0:31:52	g	and then
0:32:30	0:32:30	f	ok
0:32:56	0:32:59	g	ok
0:32:57	0:33:2	f	IY have to back up a little bit
0:35:59	0:36:8	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
0:37:1	0:37:7	g	kind of across from stony desert
0:38:3	0:38:4	f	and then what 
0:38:6	0:38:6	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
0:40:12	0:40:17	g	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
0:42:38	0:42:38	g	and then IY go
0:43:14	0:43:17	g	uhhh no
0:44:21	0:44:21	g	and then IY are
0:45:51	0:45:59	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
0:47:0	0:47:4	f	to 
0:47:26	0:47:26	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
0:47:39	0:47:41	g	so anyway
0:47:58	0:48:3	g	no IY have  
0:49:31	0:49:39	g	and IY re going up like
0:52:12	0:52:12	g	and 
0:54:46	0:54:49	g	uhm
0:55:9	0:55:9	f	ok
0:56:55	0:56:55	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
0:57:30	0:57:36	g	IY re actually starting like right
0:58:38	0:58:41	g	no IY don t have a waterhole
0:59:37	0:59:42	g	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
1:0:40	1:0:47	g	ok
1:2:51	1:3:0	g	uhm
1:4:15	1:4:15	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
1:4:54	1:4:55	f	and to the right 
1:7:31	1:7:33	f	elephants 
1:11:8	1:11:16	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
1:13:51	1:13:51	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
1:14:27	1:14:33	g	and
1:15:8	1:15:13	g	no
1:15:45	1:15:49	f	ok
1:15:55	1:16:4	g	so IY re at the hot springs
1:16:9	1:16:10	g	alright 
1:16:53	1:16:57	f	mm hmm
1:18:0	1:18:9	g	three inches
1:19:16	1:19:23	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
1:21:34	1:21:37	g	what 
1:23:38	1:23:39	g	like IY re sloping
1:23:52	1:23:59	f	ok
1:25:34	1:25:40	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
1:26:8	1:26:17	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
1:27:43	1:27:46	g	and 
1:28:10	1:28:12	g	well
1:28:27	1:28:27	g	IY re at the plane crash
1:28:26	1:28:32	f	ok wait hold on
1:28:33	1:28:35	g	around the bottom of it
1:29:8	1:29:8	f	ok
1:31:56	1:31:58	f	to the left
1:34:35	1:34:36	g	like four or five inches to the left
1:35:3	1:35:3	g	uhm
1:36:11	1:36:11	g	IY re going like
1:36:4	1:36:12	g	ok
1:36:23	1:36:25	g	uh like
1:38:26	1:38:30	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
1:39:9	1:39:16	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
1:39:42	1:39:49	g	ok 
1:40:1	1:40:5	g	ok
1:40:7	1:40:15	g	so
1:41:45	1:41:49	g	IY plane crash 
1:41:49	1:41:51	g	three inches
1:41:56	1:41:58	g	alright 
1:42:2	1:42:10	f	yeah
1:46:36	1:46:36	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
1:48:11	1:48:15	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
1:51:49	1:51:53	g	for about two inches
1:53:29	1:53:37	g	just do it like this ok
1:55:4	1:55:5	f	IY go to a lake 
1:58:59	1:58:59	f	mm hmm
2:0:8	2:0:8	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
2:0:32	2:0:39	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
2:2:45	2:2:54	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
2:3:25	2:3:25	f	yeah
2:5:36	2:5:44	g	to the right
2:5:44	2:5:52	f	yep
2:7:55	2:8:1	g	to the left
2:8:19	2:8:24	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
2:10:7	2:10:12	g	a little
2:11:51	2:11:52	g	maybe like
2:13:12	2:13:21	g	and then
2:14:54	2:15:0	g	ok
2:16:0	2:16:2	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
2:16:13	2:16:14	g	and then
2:18:1	2:18:2	g	and then IY  IY go up
2:17:59	2:18:8	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
2:19:51	2:19:52	g	uhm
2:20:44	2:20:49	f	 IY m at the savannah
2:22:41	2:22:46	g	uhm
2:22:40	2:22:46	g	after the circle
2:23:7	2:23:15	g	IY move to the left
2:24:29	2:24:34	g	are IY anywhere near there 
2:24:41	2:24:45	g	ok
2:25:21	2:25:24	g	ok
2:25:46	2:25:51	f	ok
2:26:31	2:26:35	f	ok
2:26:55	2:27:2	g	but
2:27:9	2:27:9	g	ok
2:27:18	2:27:25	g	uhm
2:27:31	2:27:39	g	yes
2:29:11	2:29:16	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
2:29:13	2:29:19	f	mm  mm
2:30:20	2:30:29	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
2:31:0	2:31:8	g	about like
2:31:46	2:31:46	g	and IY go to the left a little bit
2:32:2	2:32:5	g	there s a there s  
2:32:27	2:32:35	g	couple miles or something
2:34:47	2:34:55	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
2:35:4	2:35:4	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
2:41:25	2:41:27	g	and is to the left
2:41:33	2:41:34	g	and there s a plane crash
2:42:26	2:42:27	g	IY slope down again
2:42:41	2:42:43	g	that s IY little slope
2:44:12	2:44:12	f	IY m three inches above the savannah
2:45:20	2:45:21	g	yes
2:46:46	2:46:51	f	around the lake to the top 
2:48:2	2:48:4	f	ok
2:48:8	2:48:17	f	mm hmm
2:48:20	2:48:28	g	ok well
2:48:36	2:48:37	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
2:50:9	2:50:12	f	around the top of the lake 
2:51:19	2:51:26	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
2:51:36	2:51:42	g	after IY slope down IY d say
2:51:54	2:51:58	g	three inches straight across
2:52:20	2:52:24	g	you
2:53:38	2:53:39	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
2:54:7	2:54:12	f	to the left of the antelope
2:55:22	2:55:22	g	uhm
2:56:18	2:56:24	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
2:56:54	2:56:55	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
2:58:9	2:58:12	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
2:58:39	2:58:41	f	ok
2:58:48	2:58:56	g	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
2:59:25	2:59:34	f	mm hmm
3:2:52	3:2:53	g	so that s about IY would say
3:4:12	3:4:19	g	five
3:4:51	3:4:52	g	so IY go three inches straight
3:6:8	3:6:15	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
3:8:52	3:8:59	f	ok
3:9:25	3:9:31	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
3:13:52	3:13:58	g	well
3:17:46	3:17:46	f	ok
3:18:52	3:18:58	g	they re there
3:20:0	3:20:4	g	like
3:21:47	3:21:52	f	mm hmm
3:23:17	3:23:19	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
3:23:46	3:23:51	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
3:27:25	3:27:25	f	ok
3:28:0	3:28:0	f	ok
3:28:0	3:28:7	f	ok
3:31:14	3:31:16	g	like
3:34:7	3:34:15	g	and then
3:36:30	3:36:39	f	ok
3:37:38	3:37:46	g	to the left
3:39:40	3:39:44	g	ok
3:40:32	3:40:33	g	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
3:41:46	3:41:53	g	ok
3:42:28	3:42:30	g	just a slight slope
3:44:26	3:44:28	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
3:45:18	3:45:18	g	no IY don t have any rocks
3:45:28	3:45:37	g	it s not a big curve
3:46:3	3:46:12	f	yeah
3:46:24	3:46:24	f	IY hit some rocks though
3:46:24	3:46:27	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
3:46:43	3:46:48	f	ok
3:46:51	3:46:53	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
3:47:59	3:48:4	g	to IY right 
3:48:18	3:48:20	g	maybe like
3:48:20	3:48:23	f	nope
3:49:18	3:49:23	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
3:50:42	3:50:51	g	uhm
3:51:17	3:51:19	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
3:53:13	3:53:16	g	it s right next to it
3:53:14	3:53:16	f	so wait
3:56:15	3:56:19	f	how many inches do IY think 
3:57:23	3:57:24	g	uhm
3:57:55	3:57:58	g	ok
3:58:22	3:58:29	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
3:58:34	3:58:42	g	IY don t know
3:58:45	3:58:45	g	is the plane crash  
3:58:44	3:58:53	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
4:1:18	4:1:25	g	and then
4:4:32	4:4:39	g	ok IY re at the savannah
4:5:45	4:5:45	g	have a s 
4:6:57	4:7:5	g	ok
4:8:12	4:8:17	f	ok
4:8:52	4:8:55	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
4:9:41	4:9:47	g	ok
4:11:56	4:12:2	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
4:13:13	4:13:16	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
4:13:24	4:13:28	g	a quarter of an inch
4:16:52	4:16:54	g	ok
4:19:55	4:19:59	g	are IY  
4:20:28	4:20:28	g	uhm
4:21:35	4:21:43	g	and
4:22:25	4:22:32	g	ok
4:25:12	4:25:17	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
4:29:34	4:29:36	g	ok
4:30:37	4:30:45	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
4:31:13	4:31:15	g	from
4:33:2	4:33:7	f	IY ve a plane crash though
4:33:8	4:33:8	g	like an inch
4:33:35	4:33:44	f	to the right 
4:34:5	4:34:11	f	yeah IY see that
4:34:35	4:34:43	f	oh
4:36:20	4:36:24	f	yeah
4:36:19	4:36:25	g	on IY sheet anyway
4:36:54	4:36:59	g	are IY anywere near there 
4:37:25	4:37:32	g	IY re starting
4:37:50	4:37:58	g	like maybe an inch
4:40:54	4:41:1	g	ok
4:41:7	4:41:8	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
4:42:3	4:42:10	g	uhm
4:43:11	4:43:20	f	mm hmm
4:44:35	4:44:42	g	like
4:47:36	4:47:38	g	IY wanna kind of curve
4:47:39	4:47:48	g	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
4:48:24	4:48:30	f	ok
4:50:32	4:50:41	f	yeah 
4:51:12	4:51:19	g	after plane crash
4:53:39	4:53:43	g	ok
4:53:42	4:53:49	g	and then IY slope down to the left
4:54:25	4:54:32	g	yes IY re going towards the lake
4:54:48	4:54:53	g	the  
4:55:1	4:55:3	g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
4:56:46	4:56:52	f	ok
4:56:59	4:57:0	g	are IY in like   
4:57:19	4:57:26	g	ok
4:59:26	4:59:30	g	uhm
5:0:19	5:0:21	f	yeah
5:3:59	5:4:8	g	like
5:6:0	5:6:4	g	IY go straight down
5:7:41	5:7:48	f	uh IY don t know know what to say
5:8:19	5:8:20	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
5:10:47	5:10:49	f	do IY go around it 
5:11:26	5:11:26	g	that s about five or six inches
5:11:59	5:12:0	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
5:12:0	5:12:2	g	and then IY slope up
5:12:30	5:12:35	g	to the left
5:13:16	5:13:18	f	ok
5:13:37	5:13:45	f	up tp the right
5:13:49	5:13:57	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
5:14:9	5:14:16	g	for like
5:14:23	5:14:25	f	do IY go through anything 
5:15:17	5:15:21	g	uhm
5:16:18	5:16:18	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
5:17:10	5:17:16	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
5:17:32	5:17:39	g	IY got that 
5:18:23	5:18:30	g	and IY re sloping to the left
5:18:28	5:18:33	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
5:19:40	5:19:44	g	ok well
5:20:24	5:20:29	g	so IY make that circle
5:21:57	5:21:59	g	and IY just go straight up
5:22:13	5:22:18	f	uhm my
5:22:16	5:22:19	g	probably the same thing
5:22:15	5:22:24	f	ok
5:23:3	5:23:3	f	yeah 
5:23:0	5:23:5	g	well alright
5:23:17	5:23:19	g	well just
5:23:24	5:23:24	f	ok
5:23:24	5:23:31	g	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
5:24:30	5:24:33	g	maybe four inches on the paper
5:25:55	5:25:58	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
5:26:26	5:26:27	f	and
5:26:52	5:26:59	g	ok
5:27:26	5:27:27	g	uhm
5:27:57	5:28:0	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
5:28:35	5:28:40	f	IY hit some round rocks
5:30:51	5:30:57	g	maybe
5:31:0	5:31:6	g	ok and then IY re going
5:33:8	5:33:15	g	IY just kind of slope down
5:34:59	5:35:5	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right
5:35:7	5:35:10	g	no there s no elephants
5:35:21	5:35:21	g	and then
5:36:54	5:36:55	g	IY would say
5:37:38	5:37:43	g	and IY re going straight up
