0:0:6	0:0:6	g	228	6			in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
0:2:10	0:2:11	f	1	131			it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
0:4:23	0:4:29	g	334	269			and
0:4:58	0:5:5	g	284	305			and then IY are
0:5:9	0:5:9	f	216	309			IY ve a plane crash though
0:5:11	0:5:12	g	122	312			and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
0:5:21	0:5:28	g	56	328			alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
0:8:23	0:8:26	g	232	506			like
0:9:25	0:9:28	g	15	568			ok
0:9:31	0:9:39	g	207	579			where are IY right now   start at the savannah
0:11:12	0:11:13	f	306	673			mm hmm
0:12:10	0:12:14	g	23	734			and 
0:12:10	0:12:16	g	210	736			and IY just go straight up
0:14:4	0:14:6	g	141	846			and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
0:14:23	0:14:25	g	154	865			IY got that 
0:15:1	0:15:2	g	124	902			yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
0:15:13	0:15:14	g	11	914			ok IY plane crash isn t there
0:15:28	0:15:31	g	16	931			that s about five or six inches
0:17:42	0:17:46	g	99	1066			and then IY ll come to a savannah
0:19:4	0:19:13	g	41	1153			and then IY slope up
0:19:54	0:19:58	g	4	1198			have a s 
0:20:44	0:20:47	g	179	1247			IY go straight down
0:21:13	0:21:22	f	147	1282			to the left
0:22:32	0:22:34	g	133	1354			after plane crash
0:22:59	0:23:7	g	201	1387			so
0:23:42	0:23:44	g	285	1424			after the circle
0:23:52	0:23:52	g	35	1432			about like
0:25:40	0:25:41	g	48	1541			ok
0:27:21	0:27:26	g	238	1646			to the left
0:27:42	0:27:46	g	161	1666			where IY re going down to a plane crash
0:29:15	0:29:15	g	271	1755			uhm and there is a stony desert
0:29:26	0:29:33	f	119	1773			IY know IY have different things so
0:30:34	0:30:35	g	65	1835			and then
0:31:49	0:31:55	f	84	1915			do IY hit anything when IY go down 
0:32:47	0:32:47	g	120	1967			alright well IY ll keep going and see
0:33:0	0:33:7	g	50	1987			the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
0:39:42	0:39:47	g	32	2387			and then IY go straight
0:42:25	0:42:28	g	182	2548			uhm
0:43:36	0:43:44	g	142	2624			and there s a plane crash
0:45:10	0:45:15	g	3	2715			then
0:46:11	0:46:16	g	7	2776			on IY sheet anyway
0:50:57	0:51:0	f	328	3060			do IY go through anything 
0:51:37	0:51:41	f	87	3101			nope IY have a white mountain
0:52:13	0:52:21	g	304	3141			are IY in like almost the top of the
0:52:56	0:52:58	g	13	3178			couple inches IY re sloping down
0:54:9	0:54:12	f	263	3252			ok wait hold on
0:55:40	0:55:40	f	111	3340			yeah
0:56:17	0:56:19	g	302	3379			ok
0:57:22	0:57:26	g	72	3446			yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
0:58:14	0:58:14	f	47	3494			do IY go by the plane crash 
0:58:43	0:58:43	g	73	3523			so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
0:59:46	0:59:50	f	138	3590			curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
1:0:10	1:0:19	g	286	3619			four or five inches to the left
1:0:39	1:0:48	g	146	3648			are IY in like   
1:2:17	1:2:17	f	149	3737			ok
1:2:34	1:2:42	g	332	3762			and IY re going up like
1:4:54	1:4:58	g	272	3898			and then IY  IY go up
1:5:51	1:5:59	g	171	3959			uhm
1:5:53	1:6:2	g	335	3962			so IY make that circle
1:6:11	1:6:19	g	163	3979			well alright
1:10:1	1:10:1	g	293	4201			and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
1:10:56	1:10:58	g	121	4258			what 
1:11:10	1:11:13	g	89	4273			IY have a waterhole on IY map 
1:11:10	1:11:17	f	177	4277			ok
1:13:5	1:13:11	g	256	4391			alright 
1:13:3	1:13:11	f	158	4391			mm hmm
1:13:28	1:13:37	g	197	4417			and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
1:14:43	1:14:45	g	218	4485			like
1:16:1	1:16:2	g	100	4562			ok
1:17:5	1:17:6	f	129	4626			IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
1:17:10	1:17:19	g	88	4639			is the plane crash  
1:18:0	1:18:3	f	290	4683			do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
1:18:23	1:18:28	g	225	4708			uhm
1:18:34	1:18:43	g	278	4723			uhm
1:20:52	1:20:57	g	208	4857			go up like three  three and a half inches
1:20:58	1:21:7	g	313	4867			and curve to  not down just curve to the left
1:21:6	1:21:12	g	299	4872			so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
1:21:26	1:21:34	g	301	4894			ok
1:22:37	1:22:37	g	309	4957			after IY slope down IY d say
1:23:14	1:23:17	g	298	4997			maybe IY have different things
1:24:37	1:24:46	g	118	5086			and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
1:25:21	1:25:28	f	91	5128			IY hit some rocks though
1:26:41	1:26:48	f	212	5208			ok
1:29:20	1:29:24	g	64	5364			no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
1:29:29	1:29:37	g	246	5377			and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
1:29:32	1:29:41	f	36	5381			mm hmm
1:35:42	1:35:42	g	6	5742			a little
1:35:37	1:35:46	g	319	5746			ok

1:38:52	1:38:58	g	331	5938			uhm
1:45:1	1:45:5	g	338	6305			three inches straight across
1:45:41	1:45:50	f	282	6350			ok
1:45:59	1:46:3	f	312	6363			mm hmm
1:47:19	1:47:26	g	205	6446			five
1:47:39	1:47:42	g	283	6462			and then IY slope down to the left
1:49:52	1:49:56	g	303	6596			after that IY go straight again
1:50:6	1:50:11	f	221	6611			ok
1:50:55	1:50:58	g	231	6658			ok
1:55:32	1:55:36	f	181	6936			and there s a collapsed shelter
1:57:35	1:57:41	g	198	7061			that s IY little slope
1:58:50	1:58:55	g	39	7135			IY plane crash 
1:59:43	1:59:43	g	9	7183			the  
2:1:31	2:1:39	g	83	7299			no
2:2:7	2:2:8	g	308	7328			do IY have roman baths 
2:3:34	2:3:34	f	38	7414			ok
2:4:14	2:4:19	g	5	7459			like
2:4:22	2:4:31	g	175	7471			like IY re sloping
2:5:2	2:5:2	f	31	7502			so wait
2:5:58	2:6:6	f	215	7566			mm hmm
2:7:8	2:7:15	g	341	7635			to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
2:7:46	2:7:50	g	80	7670			and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
2:8:12	2:8:16	g	222	7696			and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
2:9:10	2:9:11	g	102	7751			like four or five inches to the left
2:12:17	2:12:24	g	101	7944			it s not a big curve
2:12:24	2:12:32	g	153	7952			uhm
2:13:8	2:13:9	g	329	7989			slight
2:13:1	2:13:9	g	85	7989			so IY go three inches straight
2:14:14	2:14:14	f	86	8054			oh
2:14:22	2:14:22	g	195	8062			and IY re going straight up
2:14:40	2:14:47	f	55	8087			am IY supposed to start at the same place 
2:16:53	2:16:58	g	92	8218			uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
2:17:28	2:17:32	f	204	8252			uhm my
2:17:47	2:17:55	g	143	8275			no IY have

2:28:52	2:28:58	g	342	8938			and then
2:30:8	2:30:9	g	28	9009			well
2:31:47	2:31:52	g	300	9112			just a slight slope
2:32:16	2:32:17	f	220	9137			ok
2:35:18	2:35:23	f	97	9323			to the left of the antelope

3:12:23	3:12:30	f	29	11550			IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
3:12:44	3:12:46	g	60	11566			aways about like four inches  four or five inches
3:13:23	3:13:30	g	58	11610			and IY go to the left a little bit
3:13:35	3:13:41	g	275	11621			there s a there s

3:19:48	3:19:57	f	235	11997			ok
3:20:26	3:20:26	g	240	12026			and then
3:20:43	3:20:48	f	193	12048			ok
3:22:2	3:22:5	f	107	12125			and
3:22:19	3:22:27	g	184	12147			maybe four inches on the paper
3:23:11	3:23:19	g	187	12199			like maybe an inch
3:23:15	3:23:23	f	224	12203			mm  mm
3:24:7	3:24:7	g	253	12247			but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
3:24:8	3:24:16	g	42	12256			IY move to the left
3:24:57	3:25:0	g	134	12300			to the right

3:30:17	3:30:19	f	333	12619			IY go to a lake 
3:31:15	3:31:22	g	314	12682			so that s about IY would say
3:31:24	3:31:32	g	71	12692			and IY should have a straight line there
3:32:23	3:32:24	g	123	12744			and then
3:32:38	3:32:39	g	95	12759			IY wanna kind of curve
3:39:32	3:39:39	g	316	13179			and is to the left
3:39:41	3:39:48	g	77	13188			ok
3:40:25	3:40:33	f	12	13233			to 
3:41:3	3:41:7	f	233	13267			elephants 
3:41:29	3:41:35	g	209	13295			IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
3:42:31	3:42:38	g	265	13358			and then IY go
3:46:6	3:46:15	f	108	13575			but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
3:47:6	3:47:15	g	178	13635			IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
3:47:13	3:47:19	g	79	13639			for like
3:48:18	3:48:22	g	27	13702			are IY anywere near there 
3:49:35	3:49:42	g	0	13782			ok
3:50:34	3:50:39	f	250	13839			so IY pass a waterhole or no 
3:54:19	3:54:21	g	317	14061			and then
3:54:30	3:54:35	g	199	14075			IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
3:55:33	3:55:41	g	24	14141			IY re going about
3:58:57	3:59:1	f	148	14341			yeah
4:3:13	4:3:20	g	125	14600			and IY re sloping to the left
4:3:21	4:3:28	g	174	14608			so IY re at the hot springs
4:6:6	4:6:14	g	194	14774			and IY go down IY slope to the right
4:7:9	4:7:18	g	257	14838			right next to IY circle should be roman baths
4:7:20	4:7:28	g	261	14848			to IY right 
4:7:53	4:7:53	f	140	14873			IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
4:7:53	4:7:59	g	213	14879			from
4:8:28	4:8:35	g	90	14915			to the left
4:9:15	4:9:24	g	103	14964			uhm
4:9:38	4:9:42	g	52	14982			well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
4:11:49	4:11:53	g	323	15113			a little bit too
4:13:22	4:13:29	g	69	15209			and then IY re going down
4:13:49	4:13:56	f	25	15236			ok
4:14:2	4:14:10	g	53	15250			kind of across from stony desert
