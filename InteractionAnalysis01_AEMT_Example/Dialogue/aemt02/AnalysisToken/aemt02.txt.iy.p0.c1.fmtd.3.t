start
start g
0	0:0:6	0:0:6	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
2	0:4:23	0:4:29	and
3	0:4:58	0:5:5	and then IY are
5	0:5:11	0:5:12	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
6	0:5:21	0:5:28	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
7	0:8:23	0:8:26	like
8	0:9:25	0:9:28	ok
9	0:9:31	0:9:39	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
11	0:12:10	0:12:14	and 
12	0:12:10	0:12:16	and IY just go straight up
13	0:14:4	0:14:6	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
14	0:14:23	0:14:25	IY got that 
15	0:15:1	0:15:2	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
16	0:15:13	0:15:14	ok IY plane crash isn t there
17	0:15:28	0:15:31	that s about five or six inches
18	0:17:42	0:17:46	and then IY ll come to a savannah
19	0:19:4	0:19:13	and then IY slope up
20	0:19:54	0:19:58	have a s 
21	0:20:44	0:20:47	IY go straight down
23	0:22:32	0:22:34	after plane crash
24	0:22:59	0:23:7	so
25	0:23:42	0:23:44	after the circle
26	0:23:52	0:23:52	about like
27	0:25:40	0:25:41	ok
28	0:27:21	0:27:26	to the left
29	0:27:42	0:27:46	where IY re going down to a plane crash
30	0:29:15	0:29:15	uhm and there is a stony desert
32	0:30:34	0:30:35	and then
34	0:32:47	0:32:47	alright well IY ll keep going and see
35	0:33:0	0:33:7	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
36	0:39:42	0:39:47	and then IY go straight
37	0:42:25	0:42:28	uhm
38	0:43:36	0:43:44	and there s a plane crash
39	0:45:10	0:45:15	then
40	0:46:11	0:46:16	on IY sheet anyway
43	0:52:13	0:52:21	are IY in like almost the top of the
44	0:52:56	0:52:58	couple inches IY re sloping down
47	0:56:17	0:56:19	ok
48	0:57:22	0:57:26	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
50	0:58:43	0:58:43	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
52	1:0:10	1:0:19	four or five inches to the left
53	1:0:39	1:0:48	are IY in like   
55	1:2:34	1:2:42	and IY re going up like
56	1:4:54	1:4:58	and then IY  IY go up
57	1:5:51	1:5:59	uhm
58	1:5:53	1:6:2	so IY make that circle
59	1:6:11	1:6:19	well alright
60	1:10:1	1:10:1	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
61	1:10:56	1:10:58	what 
62	1:11:10	1:11:13	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
64	1:13:5	1:13:11	alright 
66	1:13:28	1:13:37	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
67	1:14:43	1:14:45	like
68	1:16:1	1:16:2	ok
70	1:17:10	1:17:19	is the plane crash  
72	1:18:23	1:18:28	uhm
73	1:18:34	1:18:43	uhm
74	1:20:52	1:20:57	go up like three  three and a half inches
75	1:20:58	1:21:7	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
76	1:21:6	1:21:12	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
77	1:21:26	1:21:34	ok
78	1:22:37	1:22:37	after IY slope down IY d say
79	1:23:14	1:23:17	maybe IY have different things
80	1:24:37	1:24:46	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
83	1:29:20	1:29:24	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
84	1:29:29	1:29:37	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
86	1:35:42	1:35:42	a little
87	1:35:37	1:35:46	ok 
88	1:36:10	1:36:16	ok
90	1:38:44	1:38:53	no IY don t have any rocks
91	1:38:52	1:38:58	uhm
92	1:45:1	1:45:5	three inches straight across
95	1:47:19	1:47:26	five
96	1:47:39	1:47:42	and then IY slope down to the left
97	1:49:52	1:49:56	after that IY go straight again
99	1:50:55	1:50:58	ok
101	1:57:35	1:57:41	that s IY little slope
102	1:58:50	1:58:55	IY plane crash 
103	1:59:43	1:59:43	the  
104	2:1:31	2:1:39	no
105	2:2:7	2:2:8	do IY have roman baths 
107	2:4:14	2:4:19	like
108	2:4:22	2:4:31	like IY re sloping
111	2:7:8	2:7:15	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
112	2:7:46	2:7:50	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
113	2:8:12	2:8:16	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
114	2:9:10	2:9:11	like four or five inches to the left
115	2:12:17	2:12:24	it s not a big curve
116	2:12:24	2:12:32	uhm
117	2:13:8	2:13:9	slight
118	2:13:1	2:13:9	so IY go three inches straight
120	2:14:22	2:14:22	and IY re going straight up
122	2:16:53	2:16:58	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
124	2:17:47	2:17:55	no IY have  
125	2:19:21	2:19:27	and 
126	2:22:33	2:22:42	what 
127	2:23:25	2:23:28	uhm
128	2:23:54	2:23:54	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
129	2:24:56	2:24:57	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
132	2:27:16	2:27:20	like an inch
133	2:27:55	2:28:0	IY just kind of slope down
134	2:28:16	2:28:16	no there s no elephants
135	2:28:52	2:28:58	and then
136	2:30:8	2:30:9	well
137	2:31:47	2:31:52	just a slight slope
140	2:36:38	2:36:46	ok
141	2:39:59	2:40:1	couple miles or something
142	2:43:19	2:43:26	and IY re going
143	2:43:52	2:43:53	and then IY slope
144	2:45:34	2:45:36	uhm
145	2:46:42	2:46:50	IY re sloping
146	2:47:19	2:47:28	uhm
152	2:51:11	2:51:18	IY make
154	2:53:31	2:53:39	uh like
156	2:53:57	2:54:2	and it slopes a little bit to the right
157	2:55:1	2:55:2	are IY  
158	2:57:4	2:57:12	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
159	2:58:3	2:58:8	ok well
161	3:3:2	3:3:7	to the white mountain
162	3:4:12	3:4:13	and then
163	3:4:40	3:4:49	uhm
164	3:5:54	3:6:1	uhm
165	3:6:37	3:6:43	IY re going like
167	3:8:36	3:8:45	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
168	3:9:42	3:9:51	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
169	3:10:34	3:10:39	and then
170	3:11:19	3:11:26	alright are IY starting  near the  
172	3:12:44	3:12:46	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
173	3:13:23	3:13:30	and IY go to the left a little bit
174	3:13:35	3:13:41	there s a there s  
175	3:13:44	3:13:44	ok
176	3:16:11	3:16:14	IY re kind of going  
177	3:19:28	3:19:31	uhhh no
179	3:20:26	3:20:26	and then
182	3:22:19	3:22:27	maybe four inches on the paper
183	3:23:11	3:23:19	like maybe an inch
185	3:24:7	3:24:7	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
186	3:24:8	3:24:16	IY move to the left
187	3:24:57	3:25:0	to the right
188	3:25:32	3:25:34	no
190	3:27:40	3:27:41	ok
193	3:29:32	3:29:36	ok
195	3:31:15	3:31:22	so that s about IY would say
196	3:31:24	3:31:32	and IY should have a straight line there
197	3:32:23	3:32:24	and then
198	3:32:38	3:32:39	IY wanna kind of curve
199	3:39:32	3:39:39	and is to the left
200	3:39:41	3:39:48	ok
203	3:41:29	3:41:35	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
204	3:42:31	3:42:38	and then IY go
206	3:47:6	3:47:15	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
207	3:47:13	3:47:19	for like
208	3:48:18	3:48:22	are IY anywere near there 
209	3:49:35	3:49:42	ok
211	3:54:19	3:54:21	and then
212	3:54:30	3:54:35	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
213	3:55:33	3:55:41	IY re going about
215	4:3:13	4:3:20	and IY re sloping to the left
216	4:3:21	4:3:28	so IY re at the hot springs
217	4:6:6	4:6:14	and IY go down IY slope to the right
218	4:7:9	4:7:18	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
219	4:7:20	4:7:28	to IY right 
221	4:7:53	4:7:59	from
222	4:8:28	4:8:35	to the left
223	4:9:15	4:9:24	uhm
224	4:9:38	4:9:42	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
225	4:11:49	4:11:53	a little bit too
226	4:13:22	4:13:29	and then IY re going down
228	4:14:2	4:14:10	kind of across from stony desert
230	4:14:43	4:14:46	uhm
231	4:15:45	4:15:49	they re there
232	4:16:4	4:16:7	ok
233	4:16:52	4:17:0	not right at the stony desert
235	4:17:34	4:17:36	to the left
237	4:18:59	4:19:4	around the bottom of it
238	4:20:26	4:20:35	ok well
239	4:21:49	4:21:53	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
242	4:27:28	4:27:31	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
243	4:27:28	4:27:32	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
244	4:29:13	4:29:14	like
245	4:32:21	4:32:24	well
247	4:34:56	4:35:1	just do it like this ok
249	4:35:54	4:35:55	but
250	4:36:19	4:36:24	like three inches 
251	4:36:19	4:36:26	uhm
252	4:37:1	4:37:1	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
253	4:37:25	4:37:30	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
254	4:38:46	4:38:48	ok
255	4:39:27	4:39:33	ok
256	4:39:50	4:39:55	hmm
257	4:41:9	4:41:17	ok and then IY re going
258	4:43:16	4:43:16	a quarter of an inch
259	4:43:25	4:43:34	yes
260	4:47:42	4:47:42	for about two inches
261	4:47:46	4:47:48	to the lake 
262	4:49:12	4:49:15	no IY don t have a waterhole
263	4:53:18	4:53:22	alright alright well just
264	4:57:7	4:57:9	yes
265	4:58:9	4:58:18	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
270	5:7:28	5:7:34	and then
271	5:7:51	5:7:52	ok
272	5:10:46	5:10:51	ok
273	5:11:33	5:11:34	ok
274	5:11:34	5:11:36	IY re at the plane crash
275	5:12:1	5:12:1	three inches
276	5:12:10	5:12:18	uhm
277	5:12:47	5:12:49	yes IY re going towards the lake
278	5:17:13	5:17:18	IY don t know
281	5:22:8	5:22:14	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
284	5:27:1	5:27:10	ok
285	5:28:45	5:28:48	ok
286	5:29:43	5:29:46	and

289	5:30:59	5:31:1	uhm
290	5:31:7	5:31:9	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
291	5:31:43	5:31:44	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
292	5:34:41	5:34:50	maybe like
294	5:35:38	5:35:44	IY re actually starting like right
296	5:37:5	5:37:10	IY re just going down
298	5:39:52	5:39:52	it s right next to it
299	5:43:53	5:43:54	ok
304	5:47:45	5:47:53	ok
306	5:52:29	5:52:29	IY re starting at the stony desert
307	5:52:30	5:52:37	ok IY re at the savannah
308	5:53:42	5:53:48	and that s where the plane crash is
309	5:54:3	5:54:8	IY re starting
314	5:58:30	5:58:36	straight up
316	6:2:5	6:2:8	the slate mountain is towards the right
318	6:5:29	6:5:30	ok
319	6:6:32	6:6:41	IY slope down again
320	6:7:38	6:7:38	and IY slope is about an inch long
321	6:12:37	6:12:37	uhm
323	6:14:1	6:14:7	IY would say
324	6:15:15	6:15:16	three inches
325	6:16:23	6:16:31	so anyway
326	6:18:33	6:18:40	are IY anywhere near there 
328	6:22:19	6:22:19	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
329	6:24:10	6:24:17	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
330	6:24:23	6:24:29	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
331	6:25:11	6:25:17	alright 
332	6:29:26	6:29:33	probably the same thing
333	6:32:29	6:32:36	you
335	6:32:55	6:33:1	for like
336	6:33:40	6:33:42	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
337	6:35:20	6:35:25	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
338	6:35:42	6:35:47	well just
339	6:36:3	6:36:7	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
341	6:36:59	6:37:8	maybe like
342	6:37:20	6:37:25	an inch maybe a little bit less
start f
1	0:2:10	0:2:11	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
4	0:5:9	0:5:9	IY ve a plane crash though
10	0:11:12	0:11:13	mm hmm
22	0:21:13	0:21:22	to the left
31	0:29:26	0:29:33	IY know IY have different things so
33	0:31:49	0:31:55	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
41	0:50:57	0:51:0	do IY go through anything 
42	0:51:37	0:51:41	nope IY have a white mountain
45	0:54:9	0:54:12	ok wait hold on
46	0:55:40	0:55:40	yeah
49	0:58:14	0:58:14	do IY go by the plane crash 
51	0:59:46	0:59:50	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
54	1:2:17	1:2:17	ok
63	1:11:10	1:11:17	ok
65	1:13:3	1:13:11	mm hmm
69	1:17:5	1:17:6	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
71	1:18:0	1:18:3	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
81	1:25:21	1:25:28	IY hit some rocks though
82	1:26:41	1:26:48	ok
85	1:29:32	1:29:41	mm hmm

109	2:5:2	2:5:2	so wait
110	2:5:58	2:6:6	mm hmm

148	2:47:36	2:47:45	yeah 
149	2:48:38	2:48:44	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
150	2:50:8	2:50:17	mm hmm

214	3:58:57	3:59:1	yeah
220	4:7:53	4:7:53	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
227	4:13:49	4:13:56	ok
229	4:14:6	4:14:12	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash

295	5:36:41	5:36:42	uh IY don t know know what to say
297	5:39:16	5:39:19	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
300	5:44:56	5:44:59	and then what 
301	5:44:53	5:45:1	to the right 
302	5:46:33	5:46:41	ok
303	5:47:53	5:47:53	yeah
305	5:50:54	5:51:0	IY m three inches above the savannah
310	5:54:45	5:54:52	nope
311	5:56:0	5:56:6	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
312	5:56:29	5:56:32	so IY go to the left of the antelope
313	5:56:34	5:56:42	around the lake to the top 
315	5:58:42	5:58:47	yeah
317	6:4:23	6:4:24	around the top of the lake 
322	6:13:46	6:13:51	ok
327	6:21:50	6:21:56	ok
334	6:32:44	6:32:53	ok
340	6:36:0	6:36:8	ok
start g
0	0:0:6	0:0:6	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
2	0:4:23	0:4:29	and
3	0:4:58	0:5:5	and then IY are
5	0:5:11	0:5:12	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
6	0:5:21	0:5:28	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
7	0:8:23	0:8:26	like
8	0:9:25	0:9:28	ok
9	0:9:31	0:9:39	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
11	0:12:10	0:12:14	and 
12	0:12:10	0:12:16	and IY just go straight up
13	0:14:4	0:14:6	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
14	0:14:23	0:14:25	IY got that 
15	0:15:1	0:15:2	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
16	0:15:13	0:15:14	ok IY plane crash isn t there
17	0:15:28	0:15:31	that s about five or six inches
18	0:17:42	0:17:46	and then IY ll come to a savannah
19	0:19:4	0:19:13	and then IY slope up
20	0:19:54	0:19:58	have a s 
21	0:20:44	0:20:47	IY go straight down
23	0:22:32	0:22:34	after plane crash
24	0:22:59	0:23:7	so
25	0:23:42	0:23:44	after the circle
26	0:23:52	0:23:52	about like
27	0:25:40	0:25:41	ok
28	0:27:21	0:27:26	to the left
29	0:27:42	0:27:46	where IY re going down to a plane crash
30	0:29:15	0:29:15	uhm and there is a stony desert
32	0:30:34	0:30:35	and then
34	0:32:47	0:32:47	alright well IY ll keep going and see
35	0:33:0	0:33:7	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
36	0:39:42	0:39:47	and then IY go straight
37	0:42:25	0:42:28	uhm
38	0:43:36	0:43:44	and there s a plane crash
39	0:45:10	0:45:15	then
40	0:46:11	0:46:16	on IY sheet anyway
43	0:52:13	0:52:21	are IY in like almost the top of the
44	0:52:56	0:52:58	couple inches IY re sloping down
47	0:56:17	0:56:19	ok
48	0:57:22	0:57:26	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
50	0:58:43	0:58:43	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
52	1:0:10	1:0:19	four or five inches to the left
53	1:0:39	1:0:48	are IY in like   
55	1:2:34	1:2:42	and IY re going up like
56	1:4:54	1:4:58	and then IY  IY go up
57	1:5:51	1:5:59	uhm
58	1:5:53	1:6:2	so IY make that circle
59	1:6:11	1:6:19	well alright
60	1:10:1	1:10:1	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
61	1:10:56	1:10:58	what 
62	1:11:10	1:11:13	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
64	1:13:5	1:13:11	alright 
66	1:13:28	1:13:37	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
67	1:14:43	1:14:45	like
68	1:16:1	1:16:2	ok
70	1:17:10	1:17:19	is the plane crash  
72	1:18:23	1:18:28	uhm
73	1:18:34	1:18:43	uhm
74	1:20:52	1:20:57	go up like three  three and a half inches
75	1:20:58	1:21:7	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
76	1:21:6	1:21:12	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
77	1:21:26	1:21:34	ok
78	1:22:37	1:22:37	after IY slope down IY d say
79	1:23:14	1:23:17	maybe IY have different things
80	1:24:37	1:24:46	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
83	1:29:20	1:29:24	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
84	1:29:29	1:29:37	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
86	1:35:42	1:35:42	a little
87	1:35:37	1:35:46	ok 
88	1:36:10	1:36:16	ok
90	1:38:44	1:38:53	no IY don t have any rocks
91	1:38:52	1:38:58	uhm
92	1:45:1	1:45:5	three inches straight across
95	1:47:19	1:47:26	five
96	1:47:39	1:47:42	and then IY slope down to the left
97	1:49:52	1:49:56	after that IY go straight again
99	1:50:55	1:50:58	ok
101	1:57:35	1:57:41	that s IY little slope
102	1:58:50	1:58:55	IY plane crash 
103	1:59:43	1:59:43	the  
104	2:1:31	2:1:39	no
105	2:2:7	2:2:8	do IY have roman baths 
107	2:4:14	2:4:19	like
108	2:4:22	2:4:31	like IY re sloping
111	2:7:8	2:7:15	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
112	2:7:46	2:7:50	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
113	2:8:12	2:8:16	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
114	2:9:10	2:9:11	like four or five inches to the left
115	2:12:17	2:12:24	it s not a big curve
116	2:12:24	2:12:32	uhm
117	2:13:8	2:13:9	slight
118	2:13:1	2:13:9	so IY go three inches straight
120	2:14:22	2:14:22	and IY re going straight up
122	2:16:53	2:16:58	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
124	2:17:47	2:17:55	no IY have  
125	2:19:21	2:19:27	and 
126	2:22:33	2:22:42	what 
127	2:23:25	2:23:28	uhm
128	2:23:54	2:23:54	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
129	2:24:56	2:24:57	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
132	2:27:16	2:27:20	like an inch
133	2:27:55	2:28:0	IY just kind of slope down
134	2:28:16	2:28:16	no there s no elephants
135	2:28:52	2:28:58	and then
136	2:30:8	2:30:9	well
137	2:31:47	2:31:52	just a slight slope
140	2:36:38	2:36:46	ok

142	2:43:19	2:43:26	and IY re going
143	2:43:52	2:43:53	and then IY slope
144	2:45:34	2:45:36	uhm
145	2:46:42	2:46:50	IY re sloping
146	2:47:19	2:47:28	uhm

157	2:55:1	2:55:2	are IY  
158	2:57:4	2:57:12	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
159	2:58:3	2:58:8	ok well
161	3:3:2	3:3:7	to the white mountain
162	3:4:12	3:4:13	and then
163	3:4:40	3:4:49	uhm
164	3:5:54	3:6:1	uhm
165	3:6:37	3:6:43	IY re going like
167	3:8:36	3:8:45	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
168	3:9:42	3:9:51	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
169	3:10:34	3:10:39	and then
170	3:11:19	3:11:26	alright are IY starting  near the  
172	3:12:44	3:12:46	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
173	3:13:23	3:13:30	and IY go to the left a little bit
174	3:13:35	3:13:41	there s a there s  
175	3:13:44	3:13:44	ok
176	3:16:11	3:16:14	IY re kind of going

179	3:20:26	3:20:26	and then
182	3:22:19	3:22:27	maybe four inches on the paper
183	3:23:11	3:23:19	like maybe an inch
185	3:24:7	3:24:7	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
186	3:24:8	3:24:16	IY move to the left
187	3:24:57	3:25:0	to the right
188	3:25:32	3:25:34	no

195	3:31:15	3:31:22	so that s about IY would say
196	3:31:24	3:31:32	and IY should have a straight line there
197	3:32:23	3:32:24	and then
198	3:32:38	3:32:39	IY wanna kind of curve
199	3:39:32	3:39:39	and is to the left
200	3:39:41	3:39:48	ok
203	3:41:29	3:41:35	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
204	3:42:31	3:42:38	and then IY go
206	3:47:6	3:47:15	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s

211	3:54:19	3:54:21	and then
212	3:54:30	3:54:35	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
213	3:55:33	3:55:41	IY re going about
215	4:3:13	4:3:20	and IY re sloping to the left
216	4:3:21	4:3:28	so IY re at the hot springs
217	4:6:6	4:6:14	and IY go down IY slope to the right
218	4:7:9	4:7:18	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
219	4:7:20	4:7:28	to IY right 
221	4:7:53	4:7:59	from
222	4:8:28	4:8:35	to the left
223	4:9:15	4:9:24	uhm
224	4:9:38	4:9:42	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
225	4:11:49	4:11:53	a little bit too
226	4:13:22	4:13:29	and then IY re going down
228	4:14:2	4:14:10	kind of across from stony desert
230	4:14:43	4:14:46	uhm
231	4:15:45	4:15:49	they re there
232	4:16:4	4:16:7	ok
233	4:16:52	4:17:0	not right at the stony desert
235	4:17:34	4:17:36	to the left
237	4:18:59	4:19:4	around the bottom of it
238	4:20:26	4:20:35	ok well
239	4:21:49	4:21:53	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
242	4:27:28	4:27:31	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
243	4:27:28	4:27:32	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
244	4:29:13	4:29:14	like
245	4:32:21	4:32:24	well
247	4:34:56	4:35:1	just do it like this ok

251	4:36:19	4:36:26	uhm
252	4:37:1	4:37:1	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
253	4:37:25	4:37:30	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
254	4:38:46	4:38:48	ok
255	4:39:27	4:39:33	ok
256	4:39:50	4:39:55	hmm

259	4:43:25	4:43:34	yes
260	4:47:42	4:47:42	for about two inches
261	4:47:46	4:47:48	to the lake 
262	4:49:12	4:49:15	no IY don t have a waterhole
263	4:53:18	4:53:22	alright alright well just
264	4:57:7	4:57:9	yes
265	4:58:9	4:58:18	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
270	5:7:28	5:7:34	and then
271	5:7:51	5:7:52	ok
272	5:10:46	5:10:51	ok
273	5:11:33	5:11:34	ok
274	5:11:34	5:11:36	IY re at the plane crash
275	5:12:1	5:12:1	three inches
276	5:12:10	5:12:18	uhm
277	5:12:47	5:12:49	yes IY re going towards the lake
278	5:17:13	5:17:18	IY don t know
281	5:22:8	5:22:14	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
284	5:27:1	5:27:10	ok
285	5:28:45	5:28:48	ok
286	5:29:43	5:29:46	and

289	5:30:59	5:31:1	uhm
290	5:31:7	5:31:9	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
291	5:31:43	5:31:44	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
292	5:34:41	5:34:50	maybe like
294	5:35:38	5:35:44	IY re actually starting like right
296	5:37:5	5:37:10	IY re just going down
298	5:39:52	5:39:52	it s right next to it
299	5:43:53	5:43:54	ok
304	5:47:45	5:47:53	ok
306	5:52:29	5:52:29	IY re starting at the stony desert
307	5:52:30	5:52:37	ok IY re at the savannah
308	5:53:42	5:53:48	and that s where the plane crash is
309	5:54:3	5:54:8	IY re starting
314	5:58:30	5:58:36	straight up
316	6:2:5	6:2:8	the slate mountain is towards the right
318	6:5:29	6:5:30	ok
319	6:6:32	6:6:41	IY slope down again
320	6:7:38	6:7:38	and IY slope is about an inch long
321	6:12:37	6:12:37	uhm
323	6:14:1	6:14:7	IY would say
324	6:15:15	6:15:16	three inches
325	6:16:23	6:16:31	so anyway
326	6:18:33	6:18:40	are IY anywhere near there 
328	6:22:19	6:22:19	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
329	6:24:10	6:24:17	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
