start
start g
0	0:1:9	0:1:17	uh like
1	0:1:43	0:1:45	three inches
2	0:1:54	0:2:0	and then IY go straight
3	0:2:5	0:2:5	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
4	0:2:22	0:2:30	go up like three  three and a half inches
5	0:2:34	0:2:38	the slate mountain is towards the right
6	0:5:16	0:5:16	and then IY slope up
7	0:5:54	0:5:55	maybe four inches on the paper
9	0:7:27	0:7:34	IY got that 
10	0:11:50	0:11:56	uhm
11	0:12:41	0:12:48	are IY in like   
14	0:16:15	0:16:20	uhm and there is a stony desert
15	0:16:45	0:16:51	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
16	0:16:55	0:16:57	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
19	0:26:1	0:26:3	ok
20	0:26:41	0:26:43	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
22	0:27:43	0:27:44	ok IY plane crash isn t there
23	0:29:38	0:29:42	ok
24	0:30:19	0:30:20	yes
25	0:31:10	0:31:19	so IY go three inches straight
26	0:31:26	0:31:34	around the bottom of it
28	0:33:59	0:34:1	is the plane crash  
29	0:35:43	0:35:44	ok
32	0:42:6	0:42:10	an inch maybe a little bit less
33	0:42:14	0:42:15	uhm
36	0:47:10	0:47:11	a quarter of an inch
37	0:48:9	0:48:13	not right at the stony desert
38	0:49:0	0:49:6	like
40	0:50:14	0:50:20	the  
41	0:50:46	0:50:48	IY don t know
42	0:51:16	0:51:18	yes
43	0:51:17	0:51:23	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
45	0:52:59	0:53:8	for like
46	0:53:54	0:54:1	well
47	0:54:4	0:54:5	do IY have roman baths 
48	0:54:21	0:54:26	ok
50	0:55:33	0:55:38	maybe like
52	1:0:38	1:0:39	couple inches IY re sloping down
54	1:4:21	1:4:28	uhm
55	1:5:48	1:5:51	alright 
57	1:6:49	1:6:51	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
58	1:10:40	1:10:47	IY would say
59	1:11:42	1:11:45	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
60	1:11:46	1:11:47	and
61	1:12:28	1:12:28	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
62	1:13:51	1:13:51	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
63	1:13:47	1:13:54	IY re going like
64	1:17:7	1:17:16	uhm
65	1:17:47	1:17:56	and is to the left
66	1:18:29	1:18:30	ok and then IY re going
67	1:21:15	1:21:15	uhm
68	1:21:46	1:21:51	just a slight slope
69	1:23:8	1:23:11	but
71	1:24:13	1:24:14	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
72	1:25:38	1:25:43	straight up
73	1:27:28	1:27:34	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
74	1:29:19	1:29:20	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
78	1:33:33	1:33:33	alright 
79	1:34:6	1:34:6	uhm
82	1:36:53	1:36:56	and IY should have a straight line there
83	1:37:4	1:37:11	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
85	1:37:45	1:37:50	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
87	1:40:46	1:40:48	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
88	1:42:20	1:42:21	no IY have  
89	1:44:31	1:44:40	are IY anywhere near there 
91	1:47:23	1:47:32	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
92	1:47:28	1:47:34	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
93	1:47:36	1:47:36	on IY sheet anyway
94	1:48:28	1:48:28	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
95	1:49:11	1:49:20	ok
96	1:51:35	1:51:43	IY re starting at the stony desert
97	1:52:11	1:52:13	and then IY slope down to the left
98	1:54:34	1:54:40	IY re kind of going  
99	1:54:40	1:54:41	are IY in like almost the top of the
100	1:55:24	1:55:25	to the lake 
101	1:55:47	1:55:54	to the white mountain
102	1:58:31	1:58:33	so that s about IY would say
103	1:59:34	1:59:43	and IY slope is about an inch long
104	1:59:57	1:59:58	and IY re going straight up
105	2:0:22	2:0:28	and 
106	2:2:58	2:3:2	ok
107	2:3:42	2:3:42	no IY don t have any rocks
108	2:5:25	2:5:28	for about two inches
109	2:5:41	2:5:41	IY re actually starting like right
111	2:6:27	2:6:34	IY go straight down
113	2:7:58	2:8:1	so IY re at the hot springs
115	2:12:56	2:13:2	have a s 
118	2:17:52	2:17:55	and then
119	2:19:23	2:19:24	like IY re sloping
120	2:19:26	2:19:26	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
121	2:19:27	2:19:29	so anyway
122	2:19:33	2:19:35	hmm
123	2:21:36	2:21:44	well alright
124	2:26:3	2:26:3	to the left
125	2:26:30	2:26:35	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
126	2:27:33	2:27:41	and then IY ll come to a savannah
127	2:29:25	2:29:34	IY slope down again
130	2:32:38	2:32:39	no
131	2:32:34	2:32:43	five
132	2:32:39	2:32:44	uhm

142	2:48:31	2:48:31	ok
143	2:48:55	2:48:58	IY just kind of slope down
144	2:50:44	2:50:47	just do it like this ok
146	2:53:18	2:53:25	ok
147	2:55:4	2:55:11	are IY anywere near there 
149	2:56:11	2:56:18	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
151	2:58:46	2:58:55	about like
152	2:59:1	2:59:7	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
153	3:0:48	3:0:51	ok
155	3:3:2	3:3:2	after IY slope down IY d say
156	3:3:41	3:3:50	it s right next to it
158	3:6:3	3:6:4	three inches straight across
159	3:8:1	3:8:8	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
163	3:14:50	3:14:52	alright are IY starting  near the  
164	3:15:53	3:15:58	so
165	3:16:10	3:16:16	IY re going about
168	3:19:11	3:19:16	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
170	3:23:31	3:23:40	maybe like
171	3:23:43	3:23:49	uhm
172	3:24:59	3:25:7	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything

178	3:26:51	3:27:0	uhm
179	3:29:11	3:29:13	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
182	3:30:36	3:30:37	ok
183	3:30:44	3:30:45	IY plane crash 
184	3:31:39	3:31:44	and there s a plane crash
185	3:31:53	3:31:57	ok
187	3:32:59	3:33:1	what 
188	3:33:5	3:33:5	ok
190	3:37:53	3:37:55	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
191	3:38:37	3:38:46	and then IY slope
193	3:41:11	3:41:20	to the left
194	3:41:20	3:41:25	and IY just go straight up
195	3:44:29	3:44:37	uhhh no
196	3:44:42	3:44:43	and IY go down IY slope to the right
197	3:45:44	3:45:51	IY make
198	3:46:16	3:46:23	and
199	3:48:34	3:48:38	uhm
200	3:48:35	3:48:39	like
202	3:49:46	3:49:54	like three inches

204	3:50:18	3:50:21	uhm
206	3:51:21	3:51:28	to the left
207	3:54:5	3:54:10	they re there
208	3:54:40	3:54:43	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
210	3:56:35	3:56:37	couple miles or something
211	3:56:46	3:56:52	a little bit too
213	3:57:0	3:57:1	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
214	3:58:19	3:58:21	and IY re going up like
217	4:0:52	4:0:57	ok
218	4:0:57	4:1:3	uhm
219	4:3:0	4:3:7	after that IY go straight again
220	4:3:44	4:3:45	from
222	4:4:46	4:4:50	like an inch
223	4:5:50	4:5:55	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
224	4:6:17	4:6:17	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
226	4:8:9	4:8:14	are IY  
228	4:9:2	4:9:4	like maybe an inch
229	4:10:27	4:10:27	uhm
230	4:11:7	4:11:14	like
231	4:13:46	4:13:53	after plane crash
232	4:14:17	4:14:20	and IY re going
234	4:14:33	4:14:35	probably the same thing
235	4:15:57	4:16:0	to IY right 
236	4:16:29	4:16:35	IY re starting
237	4:22:58	4:23:7	ok
238	4:24:11	4:24:14	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
240	4:24:51	4:24:54	and IY go to the left a little bit
241	4:24:59	4:25:8	what 
243	4:30:41	4:30:46	no
244	4:30:39	4:30:48	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
246	4:32:38	4:32:46	ok
247	4:34:29	4:34:29	to the right
251	4:36:58	4:37:3	and then IY are
252	4:40:5	4:40:14	there s a there s  
253	4:40:31	4:40:36	ok
254	4:42:1	4:42:8	IY re sloping
255	4:42:35	4:42:36	IY re just going down
256	4:44:14	4:44:14	ok
257	4:47:47	4:47:54	and then
259	4:49:20	4:49:27	and then
260	4:50:52	4:50:57	three inches
261	4:51:2	4:51:3	no there s no elephants
266	4:57:51	4:57:52	four or five inches to the left
267	4:58:50	4:58:57	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
268	5:2:12	5:2:14	IY re at the plane crash
269	5:3:49	5:3:50	ok
270	5:6:7	5:6:11	slight
271	5:7:56	5:7:58	a little
272	5:9:15	5:9:22	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
273	5:10:32	5:10:34	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
274	5:11:4	5:11:12	after the circle
275	5:12:51	5:13:0	for like
279	5:17:55	5:17:55	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
280	5:18:16	5:18:22	and IY re sloping to the left
281	5:19:6	5:19:7	maybe
283	5:25:44	5:25:47	uhm
285	5:27:24	5:27:30	IY move to the left
286	5:27:26	5:27:31	then
287	5:27:32	5:27:33	yes IY re going towards the lake
288	5:29:7	5:29:14	and then IY  IY go up
289	5:29:11	5:29:18	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
290	5:32:31	5:32:36	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
292	5:34:38	5:34:41	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
293	5:35:22	5:35:30	and then
294	5:35:45	5:35:49	and then
295	5:36:31	5:36:39	alright well IY ll keep going and see
296	5:36:54	5:36:56	and that s where the plane crash is
297	5:38:10	5:38:15	uhm
299	5:43:31	5:43:38	ok
300	5:43:58	5:43:59	that s IY little slope
301	5:46:28	5:46:29	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
302	5:47:4	5:47:12	uhm
303	5:47:44	5:47:46	maybe IY have different things
304	5:48:13	5:48:21	well
305	5:49:39	5:49:40	ok well
306	5:50:25	5:50:32	ok IY re at the savannah
307	5:51:0	5:51:7	so IY make that circle
308	5:51:15	5:51:22	like four or five inches to the left
309	5:54:22	5:54:26	ok
312	5:57:7	5:57:10	ok
313	5:58:53	5:59:1	that s about five or six inches
314	5:59:37	5:59:43	alright alright well just
315	6:1:38	6:1:46	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
318	6:2:50	6:2:57	and it slopes a little bit to the right
320	6:3:29	6:3:32	ok
321	6:6:41	6:6:50	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
323	6:7:25	6:7:30	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
324	6:7:46	6:7:47	and then IY re going down
325	6:9:25	6:9:30	kind of across from stony desert
326	6:11:8	6:11:9	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
327	6:11:31	6:11:40	and then IY go
328	6:12:40	6:12:42	no IY don t have a waterhole
332	6:19:9	6:19:9	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
333	6:19:35	6:19:37	where IY re going down to a plane crash
334	6:21:10	6:21:10	ok 
337	6:23:0	6:23:1	ok well
338	6:24:52	6:24:57	IY wanna kind of curve
339	6:26:14	6:26:22	it s not a big curve
340	6:26:25	6:26:30	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
341	6:26:30	6:26:35	ok
342	6:28:29	6:28:32	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
start f
8	0:6:39	0:6:39	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
12	0:13:1	0:13:9	yep
13	0:16:2	0:16:10	yeah and IY went straight up
17	0:22:10	0:22:15	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
18	0:23:1	0:23:2	ok
21	0:26:59	0:27:7	ok
27	0:32:13	0:32:13	ok

51	0:55:50	0:55:55	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
53	1:1:8	1:1:8	ok
56	1:6:36	1:6:44	to the left
70	1:23:21	1:23:21	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain

76	1:29:38	1:29:41	ok
77	1:29:43	1:29:44	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
80	1:34:9	1:34:12	mm  mm

139	2:45:6	2:45:8	ok
141	2:46:39	2:46:44	and to the right 
145	2:51:29	2:51:29	and there s a collapsed shelter
148	2:56:4	2:56:10	IY ve a plane crash though
150	2:56:37	2:56:46	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
154	3:1:29	3:1:35	ok

278	5:17:43	5:17:45	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
282	5:24:7	5:24:7	around the lake to the top 
284	5:27:10	5:27:14	ok
291	5:34:11	5:34:19	IY have to back up a little bit
298	5:43:6	5:43:8	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
310	5:55:49	5:55:58	ok
311	5:57:4	5:57:5	up tp the right
316	6:2:11	6:2:17	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
317	6:2:49	6:2:55	yeah
319	6:3:10	6:3:10	ok
322	6:7:24	6:7:29	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
329	6:13:26	6:13:27	how many inches do IY think 
330	6:16:58	6:17:5	ok
331	6:18:20	6:18:20	 IY m at the savannah
335	6:21:38	6:21:42	yeah

2	0:1:54	0:2:0	and then IY go straight
3	0:2:5	0:2:5	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
4	0:2:22	0:2:30	go up like three  three and a half inches
5	0:2:34	0:2:38	the slate mountain is towards the right
6	0:5:16	0:5:16	and then IY slope up
7	0:5:54	0:5:55	maybe four inches on the paper
9	0:7:27	0:7:34	IY got that 
10	0:11:50	0:11:56	uhm
11	0:12:41	0:12:48	are IY in like   
14	0:16:15	0:16:20	uhm and there is a stony desert
15	0:16:45	0:16:51	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
16	0:16:55	0:16:57	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
19	0:26:1	0:26:3	ok
20	0:26:41	0:26:43	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
22	0:27:43	0:27:44	ok IY plane crash isn t there
23	0:29:38	0:29:42	ok
24	0:30:19	0:30:20	yes
25	0:31:10	0:31:19	so IY go three inches straight
26	0:31:26	0:31:34	around the bottom of it
28	0:33:59	0:34:1	is the plane crash  
29	0:35:43	0:35:44	ok
32	0:42:6	0:42:10	an inch maybe a little bit less
33	0:42:14	0:42:15	uhm
36	0:47:10	0:47:11	a quarter of an inch
37	0:48:9	0:48:13	not right at the stony desert
38	0:49:0	0:49:6	like
40	0:50:14	0:50:20	the  
41	0:50:46	0:50:48	IY don t know
42	0:51:16	0:51:18	yes
43	0:51:17	0:51:23	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
45	0:52:59	0:53:8	for like
46	0:53:54	0:54:1	well
47	0:54:4	0:54:5	do IY have roman baths 
48	0:54:21	0:54:26	ok
50	0:55:33	0:55:38	maybe like
52	1:0:38	1:0:39	couple inches IY re sloping down
54	1:4:21	1:4:28	uhm
55	1:5:48	1:5:51	alright 
57	1:6:49	1:6:51	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
58	1:10:40	1:10:47	IY would say
59	1:11:42	1:11:45	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
60	1:11:46	1:11:47	and
61	1:12:28	1:12:28	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
62	1:13:51	1:13:51	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
63	1:13:47	1:13:54	IY re going like
64	1:17:7	1:17:16	uhm
65	1:17:47	1:17:56	and is to the left
66	1:18:29	1:18:30	ok and then IY re going
67	1:21:15	1:21:15	uhm
68	1:21:46	1:21:51	just a slight slope
69	1:23:8	1:23:11	but
71	1:24:13	1:24:14	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
72	1:25:38	1:25:43	straight up
73	1:27:28	1:27:34	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
74	1:29:19	1:29:20	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
78	1:33:33	1:33:33	alright 
79	1:34:6	1:34:6	uhm
82	1:36:53	1:36:56	and IY should have a straight line there
83	1:37:4	1:37:11	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
85	1:37:45	1:37:50	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
87	1:40:46	1:40:48	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
88	1:42:20	1:42:21	no IY have  
89	1:44:31	1:44:40	are IY anywhere near there 
91	1:47:23	1:47:32	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
92	1:47:28	1:47:34	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
93	1:47:36	1:47:36	on IY sheet anyway
94	1:48:28	1:48:28	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
95	1:49:11	1:49:20	ok
96	1:51:35	1:51:43	IY re starting at the stony desert
97	1:52:11	1:52:13	and then IY slope down to the left
98	1:54:34	1:54:40	IY re kind of going  
99	1:54:40	1:54:41	are IY in like almost the top of the
100	1:55:24	1:55:25	to the lake 
101	1:55:47	1:55:54	to the white mountain
102	1:58:31	1:58:33	so that s about IY would say
103	1:59:34	1:59:43	and IY slope is about an inch long
104	1:59:57	1:59:58	and IY re going straight up
105	2:0:22	2:0:28	and 
106	2:2:58	2:3:2	ok
107	2:3:42	2:3:42	no IY don t have any rocks

109	2:5:41	2:5:41	IY re actually starting like right
111	2:6:27	2:6:34	IY go straight down
113	2:7:58	2:8:1	so IY re at the hot springs
115	2:12:56	2:13:2	have a s 
118	2:17:52	2:17:55	and then
119	2:19:23	2:19:24	like IY re sloping
120	2:19:26	2:19:26	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
121	2:19:27	2:19:29	so anyway
122	2:19:33	2:19:35	hmm
123	2:21:36	2:21:44	well alright
124	2:26:3	2:26:3	to the left
125	2:26:30	2:26:35	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
126	2:27:33	2:27:41	and then IY ll come to a savannah
127	2:29:25	2:29:34	IY slope down again
130	2:32:38	2:32:39	no
131	2:32:34	2:32:43	five

151	2:58:46	2:58:55	about like
152	2:59:1	2:59:7	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
153	3:0:48	3:0:51	ok
155	3:3:2	3:3:2	after IY slope down IY d say
156	3:3:41	3:3:50	it s right next to it
158	3:6:3	3:6:4	three inches straight across
159	3:8:1	3:8:8	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
163	3:14:50	3:14:52	alright are IY starting  near the  
164	3:15:53	3:15:58	so
165	3:16:10	3:16:16	IY re going about
168	3:19:11	3:19:16	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
170	3:23:31	3:23:40	maybe like
171	3:23:43	3:23:49	uhm
172	3:24:59	3:25:7	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything

179	3:29:11	3:29:13	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
182	3:30:36	3:30:37	ok
183	3:30:44	3:30:45	IY plane crash 
184	3:31:39	3:31:44	and there s a plane crash
185	3:31:53	3:31:57	ok
187	3:32:59	3:33:1	what 
188	3:33:5	3:33:5	ok
190	3:37:53	3:37:55	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
191	3:38:37	3:38:46	and then IY slope
193	3:41:11	3:41:20	to the left
194	3:41:20	3:41:25	and IY just go straight up
195	3:44:29	3:44:37	uhhh no
196	3:44:42	3:44:43	and IY go down IY slope to the right
197	3:45:44	3:45:51	IY make
198	3:46:16	3:46:23	and
199	3:48:34	3:48:38	uhm

207	3:54:5	3:54:10	they re there
208	3:54:40	3:54:43	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
210	3:56:35	3:56:37	couple miles or something
211	3:56:46	3:56:52	a little bit too
213	3:57:0	3:57:1	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
214	3:58:19	3:58:21	and IY re going up like
217	4:0:52	4:0:57	ok
218	4:0:57	4:1:3	uhm
219	4:3:0	4:3:7	after that IY go straight again

222	4:4:46	4:4:50	like an inch
223	4:5:50	4:5:55	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
224	4:6:17	4:6:17	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
226	4:8:9	4:8:14	are IY  
228	4:9:2	4:9:4	like maybe an inch
229	4:10:27	4:10:27	uhm
230	4:11:7	4:11:14	like
231	4:13:46	4:13:53	after plane crash
232	4:14:17	4:14:20	and IY re going
234	4:14:33	4:14:35	probably the same thing
235	4:15:57	4:16:0	to IY right 
236	4:16:29	4:16:35	IY re starting
237	4:22:58	4:23:7	ok
238	4:24:11	4:24:14	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
240	4:24:51	4:24:54	and IY go to the left a little bit
241	4:24:59	4:25:8	what 
243	4:30:41	4:30:46	no
244	4:30:39	4:30:48	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
246	4:32:38	4:32:46	ok
247	4:34:29	4:34:29	to the right
251	4:36:58	4:37:3	and then IY are
252	4:40:5	4:40:14	there s a there s  
253	4:40:31	4:40:36	ok
254	4:42:1	4:42:8	IY re sloping
255	4:42:35	4:42:36	IY re just going down
256	4:44:14	4:44:14	ok
257	4:47:47	4:47:54	and then
259	4:49:20	4:49:27	and then

266	4:57:51	4:57:52	four or five inches to the left
267	4:58:50	4:58:57	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
268	5:2:12	5:2:14	IY re at the plane crash
269	5:3:49	5:3:50	ok
270	5:6:7	5:6:11	slight
271	5:7:56	5:7:58	a little
272	5:9:15	5:9:22	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
273	5:10:32	5:10:34	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
274	5:11:4	5:11:12	after the circle
275	5:12:51	5:13:0	for like
279	5:17:55	5:17:55	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
280	5:18:16	5:18:22	and IY re sloping to the left
281	5:19:6	5:19:7	maybe
283	5:25:44	5:25:47	uhm
285	5:27:24	5:27:30	IY move to the left
286	5:27:26	5:27:31	then
287	5:27:32	5:27:33	yes IY re going towards the lake
288	5:29:7	5:29:14	and then IY  IY go up
289	5:29:11	5:29:18	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
290	5:32:31	5:32:36	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
292	5:34:38	5:34:41	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
293	5:35:22	5:35:30	and then
294	5:35:45	5:35:49	and then
295	5:36:31	5:36:39	alright well IY ll keep going and see
296	5:36:54	5:36:56	and that s where the plane crash is
297	5:38:10	5:38:15	uhm
299	5:43:31	5:43:38	ok
300	5:43:58	5:43:59	that s IY little slope
301	5:46:28	5:46:29	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
302	5:47:4	5:47:12	uhm
303	5:47:44	5:47:46	maybe IY have different things
304	5:48:13	5:48:21	well
305	5:49:39	5:49:40	ok well
306	5:50:25	5:50:32	ok IY re at the savannah
307	5:51:0	5:51:7	so IY make that circle
308	5:51:15	5:51:22	like four or five inches to the left
309	5:54:22	5:54:26	ok
312	5:57:7	5:57:10	ok
313	5:58:53	5:59:1	that s about five or six inches
314	5:59:37	5:59:43	alright alright well just
315	6:1:38	6:1:46	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
318	6:2:50	6:2:57	and it slopes a little bit to the right
320	6:3:29	6:3:32	ok
321	6:6:41	6:6:50	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
323	6:7:25	6:7:30	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
324	6:7:46	6:7:47	and then IY re going down
325	6:9:25	6:9:30	kind of across from stony desert
326	6:11:8	6:11:9	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
