start
0:0:31	0:0:37	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
0:2:40	0:2:45	g	maybe IY have different things
0:2:52	0:2:59	g	there s a there s  
0:5:14	0:5:18	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
0:5:16	0:5:21	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
0:5:35	0:5:38	g	to the left
0:5:36	0:5:42	g	and IY just go straight up
0:6:39	0:6:46	f	so wait
0:9:14	0:9:20	g	IY don t know
0:13:32	0:13:38	g	IY re starting
0:13:57	0:13:58	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
0:14:1	0:14:4	g	IY re just going down
0:16:39	0:16:42	g	four or five inches to the left
0:17:8	0:17:9	g	and then
0:17:26	0:17:27	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
0:18:6	0:18:15	g	uhm
0:19:24	0:19:33	f	ok
0:20:6	0:20:6	f	to the left of the antelope
0:21:21	0:21:22	g	ok
0:21:22	0:21:25	g	and IY re sloping to the left
0:21:25	0:21:27	g	and then IY go
0:23:52	0:23:59	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
0:23:57	0:24:3	g	and IY go to the left a little bit
0:24:11	0:24:14	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right
0:24:38	0:24:40	g	ok
0:26:0	0:26:6	f	around the top of the lake 
0:26:51	0:26:55	g	uhm
0:28:47	0:28:56	g	so that s about IY would say
0:29:33	0:29:40	g	kind of across from stony desert
0:31:56	0:31:57	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
0:32:8	0:32:15	g	for about two inches
0:33:43	0:33:52	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
0:34:24	0:34:25	g	probably the same thing
0:35:25	0:35:31	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
0:36:19	0:36:22	f	yeah
0:36:33	0:36:34	g	uhm
0:39:13	0:39:21	g	so IY re at the hot springs
0:39:20	0:39:25	g	ok IY re at the savannah
0:43:20	0:43:23	g	IY slope down again
0:44:55	0:45:1	g	to IY right 
0:46:26	0:46:31	g	couple miles or something
0:47:34	0:47:35	f	yeah IY see that
0:49:10	0:49:11	g	yes IY re going towards the lake
0:50:6	0:50:6	g	IY re going like
0:50:8	0:50:8	g	to the left
0:51:10	0:51:19	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
0:51:41	0:51:44	g	uhm
0:54:20	0:54:20	g	maybe
0:57:17	0:57:17	f	ok
0:57:54	0:57:58	g	ok
1:0:29	1:0:35	f	ok
1:1:35	1:1:35	f	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
1:2:35	1:2:41	f	yeah
1:2:44	1:2:52	g	and then IY are
1:3:2	1:3:6	f	nope IY have a white mountain
1:3:46	1:3:53	f	IY m three inches above the savannah
1:4:48	1:4:49	g	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
1:5:20	1:5:25	f	yeah and IY went straight up
1:7:19	1:7:19	g	then
1:8:51	1:8:59	g	like IY re sloping
1:10:17	1:10:20	g	and then
1:10:34	1:10:41	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
1:10:47	1:10:48	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
1:11:58	1:12:3	g	what 
1:12:21	1:12:23	f	IY ve a plane crash though
1:12:32	1:12:34	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
1:12:33	1:12:42	f	IY go to a lake 
1:12:38	1:12:42	g	a little
1:14:3	1:14:8	g	uhhh no
1:16:26	1:16:33	g	from
1:17:23	1:17:31	g	and then IY slope
1:17:52	1:17:59	g	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
1:18:26	1:18:30	g	uhm
1:19:20	1:19:22	f	elephants 
1:19:52	1:19:54	f	around the lake to the top 
1:19:58	1:20:6	f	IY have to back up a little bit
1:20:31	1:20:40	g	that s about five or six inches
1:21:18	1:21:25	g	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
1:22:0	1:22:3	g	ok
1:23:46	1:23:51	g	IY re actually starting like right
1:28:46	1:28:48	g	like four or five inches to the left
1:28:49	1:28:49	g	ok well
1:29:33	1:29:35	g	uhm
1:30:20	1:30:21	g	uhm
1:30:48	1:30:53	g	ok
1:30:58	1:31:1	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
1:31:19	1:31:21	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
1:31:24	1:31:29	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
1:31:36	1:31:36	g	no IY don t have a waterhole
1:31:55	1:32:0	f	do IY go around it 
1:31:57	1:32:4	g	just a slight slope
1:35:28	1:35:34	g	uhm
1:35:43	1:35:43	g	uhm
1:35:40	1:35:45	g	IY go straight down
1:37:10	1:37:15	g	an inch maybe a little bit less
1:37:46	1:37:51	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
1:40:2	1:40:8	g	IY wanna kind of curve
1:40:59	1:41:3	g	ok
1:41:17	1:41:20	g	around the bottom of it
1:41:25	1:41:33	g	are IY in like   
1:41:31	1:41:37	f	ok
1:43:37	1:43:38	g	and there s a plane crash
1:44:30	1:44:35	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
1:45:34	1:45:34	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
1:47:17	1:47:26	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
1:47:51	1:47:55	g	no
1:50:35	1:50:44	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
1:50:40	1:50:45	f	mm hmm
1:52:46	1:52:53	g	after IY slope down IY d say
1:53:21	1:53:27	g	uhm
1:53:55	1:53:55	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
1:53:51	1:53:58	f	ok
1:55:15	1:55:21	g	a little bit too
1:55:36	1:55:42	f	to the right 
1:56:45	1:56:46	g	so IY go three inches straight
1:56:52	1:57:1	g	for like
1:57:31	1:57:33	f	ok
1:57:32	1:57:35	f	IY hit some rocks though
1:59:21	1:59:28	g	ok
1:59:44	1:59:47	g	and then
2:0:13	2:0:13	f	IY hit some round rocks
2:7:24	2:7:24	g	ok
2:8:2	2:8:8	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
2:8:1	2:8:8	g	like three inches 
2:8:27	2:8:29	g	alright 
2:8:42	2:8:50	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
2:8:59	2:9:6	g	after plane crash
2:10:4	2:10:10	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
2:10:24	2:10:27	f	to the left
2:10:46	2:10:52	g	after that IY go straight again
2:11:31	2:11:33	g	not right at the stony desert
2:13:33	2:13:33	g	to the lake 
2:14:32	2:14:39	f	ok
2:14:35	2:14:41	g	uhm
2:16:39	2:16:41	g	and then IY  IY go up
2:16:50	2:16:58	g	three inches straight across
2:17:28	2:17:36	f	ok
2:19:5	2:19:6	g	straight up
2:23:21	2:23:21	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
2:25:9	2:25:17	g	maybe like
2:25:45	2:25:46	g	and 
2:27:9	2:27:18	g	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
2:29:29	2:29:35	g	uh like
2:29:58	2:30:1	f	oh
2:30:14	2:30:23	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
2:30:24	2:30:25	g	like
2:32:25	2:32:25	g	and IY re going straight up
2:33:15	2:33:18	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
2:36:30	2:36:37	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
2:38:55	2:39:2	g	uhm
2:38:56	2:39:3	f	ok
2:39:20	2:39:24	g	ok and then IY re going
2:40:3	2:40:9	g	three inches
2:40:55	2:41:0	g	slight
2:41:37	2:41:43	g	ok
2:42:17	2:42:20	g	alright 
2:42:51	2:42:56	f	mm hmm
2:43:6	2:43:9	f	ok
2:43:6	2:43:11	g	and
2:44:38	2:44:42	f	ok
2:44:44	2:44:46	f	and
2:45:43	2:45:52	f	ok
2:45:46	2:45:52	g	like maybe an inch
2:46:28	2:46:29	g	have a s 
2:47:11	2:47:11	g	IY re starting at the stony desert
2:49:12	2:49:19	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
2:50:16	2:50:17	g	and then
2:50:17	2:50:21	g	for like
2:51:23	2:51:28	g	yes
2:55:43	2:55:44	f	ok
2:55:54	2:55:56	g	ok
2:57:23	2:57:32	g	and that s where the plane crash is
2:58:50	2:58:51	g	just do it like this ok
3:1:50	3:1:56	f	yeah
3:3:11	3:3:12	g	and then
3:5:53	3:5:56	f	yep
3:6:20	3:6:27	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
3:7:11	3:7:18	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
3:7:12	3:7:20	g	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
3:8:58	3:9:7	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
3:9:54	3:9:56	g	IY got that 
3:10:1	3:10:10	g	no IY have  
3:15:38	3:15:41	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down

3:16:56	3:17:4	g	ok
3:17:39	3:17:44	f	ok
3:18:49	3:18:53	g	after the circle
3:19:3	3:19:10	f	IY know IY have different things so
3:20:18	3:20:20	g	and then IY slope up
3:20:20	3:20:25	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
3:20:58	3:21:7	g	ok
3:25:59	3:26:2	f	and then what 
3:26:6	3:26:6	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
3:26:40	3:26:43	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
3:26:40	3:26:45	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
3:27:1	3:27:1	g	to the white mountain
3:26:56	3:27:3	g	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
3:27:43	3:27:52	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
3:28:18	3:28:27	g	alright alright well just
3:30:32	3:30:34	g	about like
3:30:30	3:30:35	g	uhm
3:31:37	3:31:37	g	are IY anywere near there 
3:36:47	3:36:53	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
3:36:52	3:36:56	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
3:38:32	3:38:33	f	ok
3:40:50	3:40:53	g	ok
3:40:51	3:40:55	g	and
3:42:39	3:42:45	g	ok
3:44:26	3:44:35	f	 IY m at the savannah
3:47:21	3:47:21	g	five
3:49:32	3:49:34	g	so
3:50:37	3:50:41	f	ok
3:51:25	3:51:33	g	IY move to the left
3:59:1	3:59:5	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
3:59:59	4:0:7	g	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
4:0:12	4:0:15	g	three inches
4:0:29	4:0:36	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
4:1:0	4:1:5	g	ok 
4:1:41	4:1:50	g	uhm
4:8:29	4:8:37	g	IY plane crash 
4:9:44	4:9:44	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
4:13:6	4:13:13	g	ok
4:14:40	4:14:41	g	no
4:15:2	4:15:4	g	ok
4:15:9	4:15:9	g	IY re sloping
4:16:11	4:16:18	f	mm hmm
4:18:9	4:18:9	g	well just
4:18:33	4:18:40	g	and then IY re going down
4:18:56	4:19:5	f	how many inches do IY think 
4:19:6	4:19:7	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
4:21:36	4:21:36	g	like
4:21:39	4:21:42	g	and IY re going up like
4:22:43	4:22:45	f	ok
4:24:1	4:24:8	g	ok
4:24:59	4:25:2	g	and 
4:25:6	4:25:13	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
4:25:10	4:25:15	g	IY re at the plane crash
4:25:33	4:25:42	g	and IY should have a straight line there
4:28:19	4:28:25	g	well alright
4:28:35	4:28:40	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
4:29:12	4:29:13	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
4:29:25	4:29:32	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
4:31:9	4:31:18	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
4:31:42	4:31:42	g	no there s no elephants
4:34:23	4:34:25	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
4:35:0	4:35:3	g	what 
4:35:11	4:35:19	g	maybe four inches on the paper
4:35:17	4:35:25	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
4:38:44	4:38:46	g	is the plane crash  
4:39:2	4:39:5	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
4:40:24	4:40:27	f	yeah
4:41:7	4:41:11	g	like an inch
4:42:40	4:42:48	g	yes
4:44:58	4:45:6	g	uhm
4:45:34	4:45:34	f	ok wait hold on
4:46:50	4:46:58	g	so IY make that circle
4:48:54	4:48:54	g	ok
4:49:27	4:49:28	f	ok
4:50:14	4:50:22	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
4:53:30	4:53:39	f	uh IY don t know know what to say
4:54:7	4:54:7	g	do IY have roman baths 
4:55:29	4:55:36	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
4:55:44	4:55:48	g	IY make
5:1:3	5:1:11	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
5:2:44	5:2:44	g	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
5:4:7	5:4:7	g	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
5:6:22	5:6:24	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
5:7:44	5:7:44	g	that s IY little slope
5:8:8	5:8:15	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
5:8:57	5:9:3	g	are IY anywhere near there 
5:9:8	5:9:8	f	ok
5:9:17	5:9:18	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
5:13:0	5:13:7	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
5:14:16	5:14:24	g	well
5:16:1	5:16:10	g	they re there
5:17:24	5:17:28	f	and to the right 
5:19:1	5:19:3	f	mm  mm
5:19:1	5:19:9	f	mm hmm
5:21:49	5:21:56	g	ok
5:27:1	5:27:2	g	ok
5:27:3	5:27:11	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
5:27:5	5:27:13	g	ok
5:27:16	5:27:21	g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
5:29:25	5:29:34	g	and then
5:30:17	5:30:18	f	ok
5:31:23	5:31:29	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
5:32:26	5:32:27	g	but
5:34:22	5:34:24	f	yeah 
5:35:36	5:35:36	f	nope
5:37:39	5:37:44	g	IY re kind of going  
5:38:55	5:38:56	g	ok
5:42:56	5:43:4	g	the  
5:43:3	5:43:10	g	and then
5:45:18	5:45:25	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
5:46:28	5:46:32	g	uhm
5:46:49	5:46:50	g	and is to the left
5:46:53	5:46:54	f	do IY go through anything 
5:47:40	5:47:40	f	up tp the right
5:50:31	5:50:37	g	and then
5:52:36	5:52:36	g	ok
5:53:39	5:53:46	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
5:53:52	5:53:53	g	ok well
5:54:11	5:54:11	g	IY would say
5:55:8	5:55:16	g	and then IY go straight
5:56:20	5:56:27	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
5:59:23	5:59:24	g	and then IY slope down to the left
5:59:29	5:59:31	g	to the right
6:1:29	6:1:30	g	on IY sheet anyway
6:1:31	6:1:39	f	ok
