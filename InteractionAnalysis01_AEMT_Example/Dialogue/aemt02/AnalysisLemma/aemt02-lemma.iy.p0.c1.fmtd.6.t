start
start g
0	0:1:11	0:1:11	and then IY be 
1	0:1:56	0:2:2	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
2	0:2:7	0:2:11	what 
3	0:2:49	0:2:51	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
4	0:2:50	0:2:56	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
5	0:3:46	0:3:54	no IY don have any rock 
6	0:5:8	0:5:12	well 
8	0:7:43	0:7:49	ok well 
9	0:9:26	0:9:30	after IY slope down IY say 
10	0:10:24	0:10:25	so IY make circle 
11	0:10:26	0:10:32	well 
12	0:11:52	0:11:53	and there a plane crash 
13	0:11:57	0:12:5	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
14	0:12:15	0:12:22	IY have a waterhole on map 
15	0:12:51	0:12:52	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
17	0:13:23	0:13:31	so that about IY would say 
18	0:14:46	0:14:49	and then IY you go up 
19	0:16:17	0:16:26	what 
20	0:18:2	0:18:5	ok 
23	0:20:49	0:20:50	and 
25	0:22:48	0:22:49	and be to the leave 
26	0:25:48	0:25:53	the 
27	0:26:1	0:26:9	ok and then IY go 
28	0:26:12	0:26:15	ok 
29	0:27:56	0:28:5	and that where the plane crash be 
30	0:32:0	0:32:6	ok 
31	0:35:27	0:35:36	that little slope 
32	0:35:39	0:35:39	now IY at the collapse shelter 
33	0:36:22	0:36:22	and then 
34	0:37:42	0:37:48	to the leave 
35	0:38:59	0:39:5	plane crash 
36	0:39:56	0:40:2	like 
38	0:43:16	0:43:23	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
41	0:44:24	0:44:30	and IY go straight up 
43	0:45:46	0:45:53	maybe like 
44	0:49:25	0:49:27	they there 
46	0:51:33	0:51:38	three inch 
47	0:52:6	0:52:9	be IY 
48	0:53:0	0:53:5	around the bottom of it 
49	0:53:2	0:53:7	uhm 
50	0:55:43	0:55:51	ok 
51	0:58:49	0:58:55	uhm 
52	1:0:35	1:0:38	like three inch 
54	1:3:54	1:3:54	IY start at the stony desert 
55	1:6:57	1:6:59	probably the same thing 
56	1:8:27	1:8:32	for like 
58	1:9:20	1:9:22	ok IY at the savannah 
59	1:12:40	1:12:40	uhm 
60	1:14:25	1:14:27	ok 
61	1:14:48	1:14:48	well alright

72	1:30:4	1:30:11	five 
74	1:33:3	1:33:10	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
75	1:34:42	1:34:42	like maybe an inch 
76	1:35:6	1:35:11	IY 
77	1:35:6	1:35:14	ok 
79	1:36:32	1:36:40	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
80	1:36:46	1:36:46	ok 
81	1:38:4	1:38:5	and then IY slope down to the leave 
82	1:39:28	1:39:33	and IY just go straight up 
84	1:40:22	1:40:25	ok 
85	1:40:55	1:40:56	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
86	1:44:26	1:44:30	IY kind of go 
87	1:44:59	1:45:5	and 
89	1:45:28	1:45:28	ok 
90	1:49:18	1:49:24	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
91	1:50:20	1:50:21	there a there 
92	1:52:18	1:52:24	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
93	1:53:33	1:53:34	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
95	1:56:46	1:56:53	IY just kind of slope down 
97	2:1:35	2:1:41	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
98	2:2:1	2:2:7	uhm 
99	2:3:7	2:3:12	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
103	2:5:21	2:5:29	no there no elephant 
105	2:7:41	2:7:43	to the lake 
106	2:10:59	2:10:59	ok 
107	2:11:44	2:11:46	a quarter of an inch 
108	2:11:46	2:11:55	and then 
109	2:12:7	2:12:7	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
110	2:12:6	2:12:14	IY get 
111	2:13:38	2:13:47	like 
112	2:15:19	2:15:27	IY wanna kind of curve 
114	2:18:57	2:19:4	be IY in like 
116	2:22:5	2:22:8	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
117	2:22:52	2:22:56	uhm 
121	2:28:6	2:28:7	after IY go straight again 
122	2:29:54	2:29:59	ok 
123	2:32:49	2:32:57	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
124	2:33:45	2:33:47	uhm 
125	2:34:16	2:34:23	alright 
126	2:34:39	2:34:44	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
127	2:35:4	2:35:8	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
129	2:36:31	2:36:31	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
133	2:37:45	2:37:51	IY go about 
135	2:41:16	2:41:17	couple mile or something 
138	2:43:29	2:43:29	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
139	2:43:55	2:43:56	and IY go 
140	2:45:0	2:45:7	an inch maybe a little bit less 
141	2:47:23	2:47:27	and then IY slope up 
143	2:48:49	2:48:54	like 
144	2:49:14	2:49:20	uhm 
145	2:49:36	2:49:40	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
146	2:50:15	2:50:19	no 
147	2:51:9	2:51:14	just a slight slope 
148	2:53:57	2:53:57	uhm 
149	2:54:15	2:54:24	slight 
151	2:59:42	2:59:42	uhm and there be a stony desert 
152	3:1:8	3:1:10	couple inch IY slope down 
153	3:1:55	3:2:3	so IY at the hot spring 
155	3:2:31	3:2:40	ok 
156	3:3:18	3:3:26	like 
157	3:3:32	3:3:38	and

163	3:9:54	3:9:56	straight up 
164	3:10:58	3:11:3	and IY should have a straight line there 
165	3:13:28	3:13:35	ok 
166	3:13:42	3:13:49	ok 
169	3:18:35	3:18:42	ok

173	3:21:40	3:21:46	ok 
174	3:23:25	3:23:33	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
175	3:23:31	3:23:39	yes 
177	3:24:6	3:24:10	IY make 
179	3:26:15	3:26:18	after plane crash 
180	3:27:23	3:27:32	away about like four inch four or five inch 
181	3:28:59	3:29:4	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
184	3:31:7	3:31:11	and then IY slope 
185	3:34:2	3:34:4	ok 
186	3:33:59	3:34:5	four or five inch to the leave 
187	3:34:20	3:34:20	and then 
188	3:34:38	3:34:46	so IY go three inch straight 
189	3:34:45	3:34:49	like four or five inch to the leave 
192	3:36:57	3:37:5	alright 
194	3:37:49	3:37:56	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
197	3:39:0	3:39:8	IY don know 
198	3:39:24	3:39:24	not right at the stony desert 
199	3:40:57	3:41:1	and then 
202	3:43:5	3:43:10	uhm 
203	3:44:1	3:44:4	like an inch 
205	3:46:1	3:46:6	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
206	3:46:35	3:46:35	uhm 
207	3:47:7	3:47:10	and then IY go down 
209	3:51:11	3:51:12	it not a big curve 
211	3:54:52	3:54:59	a little 
212	3:59:40	3:59:49	to right 
213	4:0:52	4:1:1	uhm

215	4:3:55	4:4:4	uhm 
216	4:7:3	4:7:6	right next to circle should be roman bath 
217	4:7:8	4:7:10	a little bit too 
218	4:7:48	4:7:50	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
219	4:9:44	4:9:49	uh like 
220	4:9:54	4:9:57	no IY don have a waterhole 
221	4:13:41	4:13:44	alright be IY start near the 
222	4:15:0	4:15:0	be the plane crash 
223	4:14:58	4:15:2	maybe four inch on the paper 
224	4:15:11	4:15:17	do IY have roman bath 
225	4:15:23	4:15:24	to the leave of little path where path should be 
226	4:16:20	4:16:29	ok 
227	4:17:36	4:17:39	be IY anywere near there 
228	4:18:30	4:18:32	yes 
229	4:18:59	4:19:7	ok plane crash isn there 
231	4:22:24	4:22:24	uhm IY straighten out slope 
234	4:25:36	4:25:38	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
236	4:28:42	4:28:48	Hmm 
237	4:29:6	4:29:11	for about two inch 
239	4:31:54	4:31:55	ok 
241	4:32:43	4:32:52	the slate mountain be towards the right 
242	4:34:43	4:34:52	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
243	4:37:6	4:37:13	three inch 
244	4:38:17	4:38:26	where IY go down to a plane crash 
245	4:40:39	4:40:45	kind of across from stony desert 
246	4:41:0	4:41:8	uhhh no 
247	4:41:59	4:41:59	IY just go down 
248	4:42:30	4:42:39	and 
253	4:50:51	4:50:52	alright well IY keep go and see 
254	4:51:43	4:51:52	just do it like this ok 
255	4:52:0	4:52:7	to the leave 
256	4:52:34	4:52:36	and then IY come to a savannah 
257	4:52:59	4:52:59	on sheet anyway 
258	4:52:55	4:53:2	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
259	4:54:10	4:54:14	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
260	4:54:48	4:54:51	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
262	4:55:48	4:55:49	IY actually start like right 
263	4:55:44	4:55:53	IY slope 
264	4:56:30	4:56:32	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
265	4:57:13	4:57:19	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
267	4:58:32	4:58:40	it right next to it 
270	5:2:47	5:2:53	yes IY go towards the lake 
271	5:3:25	5:3:26	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
272	5:3:25	5:3:30	uhm 
276	5:8:0	5:8:7	no

279	5:13:7	5:13:9	be IY anywhere near there 
280	5:13:9	5:13:17	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
281	5:13:44	5:13:51	and then 
282	5:13:59	5:14:1	after the circle 
283	5:15:9	5:15:10	IY at the plane crash 
284	5:15:6	5:15:12	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
286	5:17:32	5:17:40	maybe IY have different thing 
290	5:21:24	5:21:27	and slope be about an inch long 
292	5:24:26	5:24:29	ok 
294	5:25:37	5:25:38	and IY go up like 
295	5:26:49	5:26:52	go up like three three and a half inch 
297	5:31:52	5:32:0	uhm 
299	5:34:38	5:34:47	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
300	5:35:6	5:35:10	and IY slope to the leave 
301	5:35:12	5:35:12	to the leave 
302	5:35:11	5:35:20	and it slope a little bit to the right 
303	5:36:32	5:36:39	IY move to the leave 
304	5:36:53	5:36:59	three inch straight across 
305	5:36:55	5:37:3	ok well 
306	5:42:54	5:43:0	IY go like 
307	5:44:13	5:44:20	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
308	5:49:17	5:49:20	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
309	5:49:24	5:49:25	to the white mountain 
311	5:51:4	5:51:12	have a s 
313	5:54:6	5:54:11	maybe 
314	5:54:51	5:54:59	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
315	5:56:6	5:56:11	IY would say 
317	6:0:4	6:0:10	but 
318	6:0:39	6:0:40	uhm 
320	6:1:29	6:1:29	from 
321	6:1:33	6:1:41	and then 
323	6:4:56	6:5:5	IY slope down again 
325	6:8:22	6:8:24	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
326	6:9:21	6:9:22	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
328	6:11:41	6:11:41	and then 
329	6:13:17	6:13:26	that about five or six inch 
331	6:16:39	6:16:44	ok 
332	6:17:25	6:17:28	ok

334	6:19:33	6:19:41	uhm 
335	6:20:45	6:20:45	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
337	6:21:32	6:21:36	be IY in like almost the top of the 
339	6:22:26	6:22:30	no IY have 
341	6:24:0	6:24:1	about like 
342	6:24:50	6:24:52	to the right 
start f
7	0:7:2	0:7:3	ok 
16	0:13:14	0:13:17	ok 
21	0:18:34	0:18:34	uhm

53	1:2:31	1:2:36	to 
57	1:9:8	1:9:14	and curve down to the leave 
65	1:19:37	1:19:43	ok 
69	1:23:42	1:23:51	yeah 
73	1:32:10	1:32:11	yeah

101	2:5:10	2:5:15	ok 
102	2:5:15	2:5:20	mm Hmm 
104	2:7:16	2:7:24	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
113	2:17:43	2:17:49	ok 
115	2:19:35	2:19:44	IY at the savannah 
118	2:23:30	2:23:37	to the right 
119	2:24:41	2:24:42	IY hit some rock though 
120	2:27:15	2:27:23	IY three inch above the savannah 
128	2:35:19	2:35:23	IY go to a lake 
130	2:37:2	2:37:2	mm Hmm 
131	2:37:37	2:37:43	and 
132	2:37:51	2:37:51	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
134	2:40:50	2:40:52	ok 
136	2:41:30	2:41:32	IY plane crash IY be talk about earlier that up there 
137	2:42:51	2:42:57	IY a plane crash though 
142	2:48:23	2:48:30	yeah 
150	2:55:20	2:55:23	and then what 
154	3:2:10	3:2:16	to the leave of the antelope 
160	3:5:44	3:5:47	ok

195	3:38:12	3:38:21	plane crash be on the other side but IY just ok 
196	3:38:58	3:39:1	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
200	3:41:16	3:41:17	ok 
201	3:42:26	3:42:26	mm Hmm 
204	3:45:9	3:45:13	ok

261	4:55:9	4:55:12	mm Hmm 
266	4:58:19	4:58:28	do IY go by the plane crash 
268	5:0:55	5:1:3	plane crash IY don think be yeah 
269	5:1:59	5:2:1	yeah 
273	5:4:28	5:4:35	IY hit some round rock 
274	5:5:32	5:5:36	yeah

287	5:17:57	5:18:6	ok 
288	5:19:23	5:19:32	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
289	5:20:58	5:21:2	yeah 
291	5:23:7	5:23:12	ok 
293	5:24:50	5:24:53	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
296	5:26:49	5:26:55	and there a collapse shelter 
298	5:34:42	5:34:43	ok 
310	5:49:48	5:49:53	ok wait hold on 
312	5:51:57	5:51:57	ok 
316	5:59:28	5:59:34	mm Hmm 
319	6:0:58	6:1:2	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash 
322	6:2:54	6:3:1	ok 
324	6:6:56	6:6:58	but that like five six inch from where IY be now 
327	6:9:19	6:9:28	nope 
330	6:14:42	6:14:46	IY start yeah the stony desert 
336	6:21:25	6:21:34	ok 
338	6:21:52	6:22:1	ok 
340	6:23:37	6:23:40	ok

2	0:2:7	0:2:11	what 
3	0:2:49	0:2:51	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
4	0:2:50	0:2:56	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
5	0:3:46	0:3:54	no IY don have any rock 
6	0:5:8	0:5:12	well 
8	0:7:43	0:7:49	ok well 
9	0:9:26	0:9:30	after IY slope down IY say 
10	0:10:24	0:10:25	so IY make circle 
11	0:10:26	0:10:32	well 
12	0:11:52	0:11:53	and there a plane crash 
13	0:11:57	0:12:5	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
14	0:12:15	0:12:22	IY have a waterhole on map 
15	0:12:51	0:12:52	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
17	0:13:23	0:13:31	so that about IY would say 
18	0:14:46	0:14:49	and then IY you go up 
19	0:16:17	0:16:26	what

27	0:26:1	0:26:9	ok and then IY go 
28	0:26:12	0:26:15	ok 
29	0:27:56	0:28:5	and that where the plane crash be 
30	0:32:0	0:32:6	ok 
31	0:35:27	0:35:36	that little slope 
32	0:35:39	0:35:39	now IY at the collapse shelter 
33	0:36:22	0:36:22	and then 
34	0:37:42	0:37:48	to the leave 
35	0:38:59	0:39:5	plane crash 
36	0:39:56	0:40:2	like 
38	0:43:16	0:43:23	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
41	0:44:24	0:44:30	and IY go straight up 
43	0:45:46	0:45:53	maybe like 
44	0:49:25	0:49:27	they there 
46	0:51:33	0:51:38	three inch 
47	0:52:6	0:52:9	be IY

51	0:58:49	0:58:55	uhm 
52	1:0:35	1:0:38	like three inch 
54	1:3:54	1:3:54	IY start at the stony desert 
55	1:6:57	1:6:59	probably the same thing 
56	1:8:27	1:8:32	for like 
58	1:9:20	1:9:22	ok IY at the savannah

72	1:30:4	1:30:11	five 
74	1:33:3	1:33:10	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
75	1:34:42	1:34:42	like maybe an inch 
76	1:35:6	1:35:11	IY 
77	1:35:6	1:35:14	ok

80	1:36:46	1:36:46	ok 
81	1:38:4	1:38:5	and then IY slope down to the leave 
82	1:39:28	1:39:33	and IY just go straight up 
84	1:40:22	1:40:25	ok 
85	1:40:55	1:40:56	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
86	1:44:26	1:44:30	IY kind of go 
87	1:44:59	1:45:5	and 
89	1:45:28	1:45:28	ok 
90	1:49:18	1:49:24	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
91	1:50:20	1:50:21	there a there 
92	1:52:18	1:52:24	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
93	1:53:33	1:53:34	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
95	1:56:46	1:56:53	IY just kind of slope down 
97	2:1:35	2:1:41	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
98	2:2:1	2:2:7	uhm 
99	2:3:7	2:3:12	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
103	2:5:21	2:5:29	no there no elephant 
105	2:7:41	2:7:43	to the lake 
106	2:10:59	2:10:59	ok

114	2:18:57	2:19:4	be IY in like 
116	2:22:5	2:22:8	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
117	2:22:52	2:22:56	uhm 
121	2:28:6	2:28:7	after IY go straight again 
122	2:29:54	2:29:59	ok 
123	2:32:49	2:32:57	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
124	2:33:45	2:33:47	uhm 
125	2:34:16	2:34:23	alright 
126	2:34:39	2:34:44	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
127	2:35:4	2:35:8	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
129	2:36:31	2:36:31	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
133	2:37:45	2:37:51	IY go about 
135	2:41:16	2:41:17	couple mile or something 
138	2:43:29	2:43:29	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
139	2:43:55	2:43:56	and IY go 
140	2:45:0	2:45:7	an inch maybe a little bit less 
141	2:47:23	2:47:27	and then IY slope up 
143	2:48:49	2:48:54	like 
144	2:49:14	2:49:20	uhm 
145	2:49:36	2:49:40	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
146	2:50:15	2:50:19	no

151	2:59:42	2:59:42	uhm and there be a stony desert 
152	3:1:8	3:1:10	couple inch IY slope down 
153	3:1:55	3:2:3	so IY at the hot spring 
155	3:2:31	3:2:40	ok 
156	3:3:18	3:3:26	like

177	3:24:6	3:24:10	IY make 
179	3:26:15	3:26:18	after plane crash 
180	3:27:23	3:27:32	away about like four inch four or five inch 
181	3:28:59	3:29:4	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
184	3:31:7	3:31:11	and then IY slope 
185	3:34:2	3:34:4	ok 
186	3:33:59	3:34:5	four or five inch to the leave

192	3:36:57	3:37:5	alright 
194	3:37:49	3:37:56	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
197	3:39:0	3:39:8	IY don know 
198	3:39:24	3:39:24	not right at the stony desert 
199	3:40:57	3:41:1	and then 
202	3:43:5	3:43:10	uhm 
203	3:44:1	3:44:4	like an inch 
205	3:46:1	3:46:6	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
206	3:46:35	3:46:35	uhm 
207	3:47:7	3:47:10	and then IY go down 
209	3:51:11	3:51:12	it not a big curve 
211	3:54:52	3:54:59	a little 
212	3:59:40	3:59:49	to right

215	4:3:55	4:4:4	uhm 
216	4:7:3	4:7:6	right next to circle should be roman bath 
217	4:7:8	4:7:10	a little bit too 
218	4:7:48	4:7:50	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
219	4:9:44	4:9:49	uh like 
220	4:9:54	4:9:57	no IY don have a waterhole 
221	4:13:41	4:13:44	alright be IY start near the 
222	4:15:0	4:15:0	be the plane crash 
223	4:14:58	4:15:2	maybe four inch on the paper 
224	4:15:11	4:15:17	do IY have roman bath 
225	4:15:23	4:15:24	to the leave of little path where path should be 
226	4:16:20	4:16:29	ok 
227	4:17:36	4:17:39	be IY anywere near there 
228	4:18:30	4:18:32	yes 
229	4:18:59	4:19:7	ok plane crash isn there 
231	4:22:24	4:22:24	uhm IY straighten out slope 
234	4:25:36	4:25:38	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
236	4:28:42	4:28:48	Hmm 
237	4:29:6	4:29:11	for about two inch 
239	4:31:54	4:31:55	ok 
241	4:32:43	4:32:52	the slate mountain be towards the right 
242	4:34:43	4:34:52	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
243	4:37:6	4:37:13	three inch 
244	4:38:17	4:38:26	where IY go down to a plane crash 
245	4:40:39	4:40:45	kind of across from stony desert 
246	4:41:0	4:41:8	uhhh no 
247	4:41:59	4:41:59	IY just go down 
248	4:42:30	4:42:39	and 
253	4:50:51	4:50:52	alright well IY keep go and see 
254	4:51:43	4:51:52	just do it like this ok 
255	4:52:0	4:52:7	to the leave 
256	4:52:34	4:52:36	and then IY come to a savannah 
257	4:52:59	4:52:59	on sheet anyway 
258	4:52:55	4:53:2	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
259	4:54:10	4:54:14	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
260	4:54:48	4:54:51	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
262	4:55:48	4:55:49	IY actually start like right 
263	4:55:44	4:55:53	IY slope 
264	4:56:30	4:56:32	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
265	4:57:13	4:57:19	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
267	4:58:32	4:58:40	it right next to it 
270	5:2:47	5:2:53	yes IY go towards the lake 
271	5:3:25	5:3:26	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
272	5:3:25	5:3:30	uhm 
276	5:8:0	5:8:7	no

279	5:13:7	5:13:9	be IY anywhere near there 
280	5:13:9	5:13:17	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
281	5:13:44	5:13:51	and then 
282	5:13:59	5:14:1	after the circle 
283	5:15:9	5:15:10	IY at the plane crash 
284	5:15:6	5:15:12	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
286	5:17:32	5:17:40	maybe IY have different thing 
290	5:21:24	5:21:27	and slope be about an inch long 
292	5:24:26	5:24:29	ok 
294	5:25:37	5:25:38	and IY go up like 
295	5:26:49	5:26:52	go up like three three and a half inch 
297	5:31:52	5:32:0	uhm 
299	5:34:38	5:34:47	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
300	5:35:6	5:35:10	and IY slope to the leave 
301	5:35:12	5:35:12	to the leave 
302	5:35:11	5:35:20	and it slope a little bit to the right 
303	5:36:32	5:36:39	IY move to the leave 
304	5:36:53	5:36:59	three inch straight across 
305	5:36:55	5:37:3	ok well 
306	5:42:54	5:43:0	IY go like 
307	5:44:13	5:44:20	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
308	5:49:17	5:49:20	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
309	5:49:24	5:49:25	to the white mountain 
311	5:51:4	5:51:12	have a s 
313	5:54:6	5:54:11	maybe 
314	5:54:51	5:54:59	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
315	5:56:6	5:56:11	IY would say 
317	6:0:4	6:0:10	but 
318	6:0:39	6:0:40	uhm 
320	6:1:29	6:1:29	from
