start
0:0:2	0:0:8	g	after the circle 
0:0:40	0:0:45	g	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
0:0:44	0:0:49	g	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
0:0:52	0:0:53	f	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
0:1:55	0:1:55	g	to the white mountain 
0:5:13	0:5:15	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
0:5:49	0:5:51	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
0:6:9	0:6:10	f	ok 
0:6:32	0:6:33	g	ok IY at the savannah 
0:6:34	0:6:36	g	four or five inch to the leave 
0:9:56	0:9:59	g	ok 
0:10:11	0:10:11	g	uhm 
0:11:42	0:11:46	f	but that like five six inch from where IY be now 
0:13:32	0:13:33	f	IY hit some round rock 
0:16:33	0:16:38	g	well 
0:18:26	0:18:34	f	IY plane crash IY be talk about earlier that up there 
0:19:11	0:19:16	f	ok 
0:19:27	0:19:32	g	like IY slope 
0:22:42	0:22:47	g	and then IY you go up 
0:23:11	0:23:12	g	and IY just go straight up 
0:24:19	0:24:19	g	and 
0:24:17	0:24:22	g	ok 
0:24:26	0:24:28	g	and then IY slope up 
0:24:20	0:24:29	g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
0:25:48	0:25:49	f	yeah 
0:26:32	0:26:32	g	straight up 
0:27:6	0:27:7	g	uh like 
0:27:42	0:27:47	g	ok 
0:28:21	0:28:26	g	alright well IY keep go and see 
0:29:38	0:29:40	g	alright 
0:31:17	0:31:23	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
0:32:33	0:32:35	g	IY would say 
0:32:53	0:32:57	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
0:34:15	0:34:20	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
0:34:28	0:34:36	g	alright alright well just 
0:35:9	0:35:14	g	IY kind of go 
0:36:51	0:36:52	f	no IY go with hot spring IY have 
0:36:55	0:36:57	g	no IY have 
0:37:7	0:37:8	g	IY at the plane crash 
0:37:3	0:37:10	g	for like 
0:40:17	0:40:22	g	for about two inch 
0:40:47	0:40:48	f	ok 
0:42:19	0:42:27	g	so IY at the hot spring 
0:42:46	0:42:48	g	well just 
0:45:43	0:45:43	g	to the right 
0:46:5	0:46:5	g	ok 
0:49:12	0:49:21	g	after IY go straight again 
0:50:10	0:50:11	f	do IY go around it 
0:51:20	0:51:21	g	and IY slope to the leave 
0:52:37	0:52:42	f	mm Hmm 
0:52:48	0:52:49	g	so IY go three inch straight 
0:58:1	0:58:10	g	ok 
0:58:24	0:58:29	f	mm Hmm 
1:0:15	1:0:17	g	uhm 
1:2:12	1:2:14	g	but 
1:3:30	1:3:39	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
1:3:35	1:3:40	f	to 
1:4:26	1:4:26	g	no 
1:4:42	1:4:42	g	and then IY go down 
1:5:30	1:5:39	g	do IY have roman bath 
1:5:59	1:6:3	g	so anyway 
1:5:58	1:6:3	g	and then IY be 
1:6:34	1:6:42	g	and IY go 
1:6:58	1:7:0	g	what 
1:7:18	1:7:24	f	around the top of the lake 
1:11:46	1:11:54	f	ok 
1:13:6	1:13:8	g	a little 
1:13:28	1:13:29	f	IY go to a lake 
1:13:31	1:13:38	f	ok 
1:14:56	1:15:5	g	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
1:15:14	1:15:18	f	ok 
1:15:21	1:15:27	g	and then IY slope 
1:16:40	1:16:48	f	ok 
1:23:26	1:23:34	g	and then 
1:23:41	1:23:48	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
1:27:6	1:27:12	f	ok 
1:27:28	1:27:28	f	and 
1:27:45	1:27:50	g	IY don know 
1:28:26	1:28:30	f	ok 
1:29:49	1:29:52	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
1:31:4	1:31:5	g	and then IY go 
1:31:44	1:31:51	g	it right next to it 
1:32:5	1:32:14	g	uhm 
1:32:20	1:32:20	g	uhm IY straighten out slope 
1:32:43	1:32:43	g	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
1:32:49	1:32:50	g	IY just go down 
1:33:29	1:33:32	g	be IY in like 
1:33:42	1:33:48	f	plane crash IY don think be yeah 
1:36:58	1:37:2	g	to the leave 
1:38:13	1:38:14	f	yeah and IY go straight up 
1:39:0	1:39:3	g	uhm 
1:39:23	1:39:30	g	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
1:42:16	1:42:17	f	ok 
1:42:49	1:42:52	f	IY start yeah the stony desert 
1:42:48	1:42:53	g	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
1:45:9	1:45:9	f	IY hit some rock though 
1:46:18	1:46:21	g	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
1:46:18	1:46:23	g	plane crash 
1:46:16	1:46:23	f	up tp the right 
1:47:40	1:47:48	g	uhm 
1:47:44	1:47:48	g	around the bottom of it 
1:48:1	1:48:10	g	uhm 
1:48:4	1:48:12	f	yeah 
1:48:36	1:48:39	f	yeah IY see 
1:49:22	1:49:29	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
1:49:42	1:49:50	g	three inch straight across 
1:54:27	1:54:33	f	ok 
1:55:32	1:55:41	g	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
1:56:3	1:56:5	g	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
1:58:7	1:58:7	g	like three inch 
1:58:22	1:58:23	f	ok 
2:0:8	2:0:11	g	IY 
2:0:26	2:0:29	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
2:0:31	2:0:38	g	they there 
2:3:43	2:3:48	g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
2:5:12	2:5:15	g	what 
2:6:21	2:6:22	f	yeah 
2:7:12	2:7:14	g	and IY go straight up 
2:8:29	2:8:37	f	ok 
2:8:54	2:9:0	g	on sheet anyway 
2:9:14	2:9:22	g	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
2:10:49	2:10:49	g	after plane crash 
2:12:8	2:12:8	g	IY make 
2:13:42	2:13:50	g	the 
2:13:54	2:14:0	f	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash 
2:14:3	2:14:4	f	yeah 
2:14:43	2:14:49	f	ok 
2:15:42	2:15:46	g	for like 
2:15:48	2:15:57	f	ok 
2:16:10	2:16:14	f	yeah 
2:16:57	2:17:5	g	no IY don have a waterhole 
2:17:29	2:17:36	g	like maybe an inch 
2:18:32	2:18:39	g	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
2:20:49	2:20:52	g	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
2:21:2	2:21:7	f	and to the right 
2:21:41	2:21:43	g	IY go straight down 
2:22:10	2:22:18	g	ok well 
2:23:11	2:23:12	g	about like 
2:23:58	2:24:1	g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
2:28:27	2:28:33	g	so that about IY would say 
2:28:53	2:28:57	f	how many inch do IY think 
2:29:40	2:29:44	g	couple inch IY slope down 
2:31:9	2:31:18	g	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
2:31:36	2:31:38	f	ok 
2:35:10	2:35:12	f	mm Hmm 
2:37:3	2:37:8	g	just do it like this ok 
2:37:6	2:37:12	f	ok 
2:37:41	2:37:44	f	ok 
2:38:20	2:38:20	f	uhm 
2:39:23	2:39:29	g	it not a big curve 
2:40:34	2:40:41	g	and that where the plane crash be 
2:41:5	2:41:12	f	IY have to back up a little bit 
2:41:47	2:41:52	g	yes 
2:42:11	2:42:18	g	IY actually start like right 
2:43:29	2:43:29	g	then 
2:43:55	2:43:56	g	be IY anywhere near there 
2:43:51	2:43:57	g	IY have a waterhole on map 
2:44:38	2:44:41	g	uhm 
2:44:49	2:44:52	g	to right 
2:45:55	2:46:1	g	ok 
2:46:6	2:46:11	g	like 
2:46:21	2:46:28	g	and then IY slope down to the leave 
2:46:26	2:46:29	g	couple mile or something 
2:48:1	2:48:1	g	that about five or six inch 
2:48:36	2:48:39	g	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
2:50:16	2:50:17	f	elephant 
2:50:50	2:50:55	g	to the leave 
2:51:42	2:51:43	g	no IY don have any rock 
2:52:25	2:52:29	g	and then IY come to a savannah 
2:53:33	2:53:40	f	IY at the savannah 
2:54:23	2:54:24	g	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
2:54:38	2:54:40	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
2:54:40	2:54:47	g	ok plane crash isn there 
2:55:6	2:55:12	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
2:55:28	2:55:37	g	yes 
2:56:17	2:56:24	g	after IY slope down IY say 
2:57:9	2:57:16	f	do IY go through anything 
2:57:16	2:57:22	g	and there a plane crash 
2:58:2	2:58:3	g	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
3:0:40	3:0:41	g	and IY go up like 
3:2:46	3:2:54	g	uhm 
3:3:52	3:3:58	g	maybe IY have different thing 
3:11:57	3:12:4	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
3:13:39	3:13:43	g	maybe like 
3:14:10	3:14:12	g	ok 
3:14:13	3:14:22	g	IY get 
3:21:44	3:21:48	g	and 
3:24:8	3:24:15	g	and slope be about an inch long 
3:25:9	3:25:14	g	the slate mountain be towards the right 
3:25:55	3:25:58	g	five 
3:27:53	3:27:53	f	it not like in the same place IY describe 
3:29:3	3:29:12	g	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
3:35:56	3:36:5	g	alright be IY start near the 
3:39:49	3:39:58	g	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
3:40:46	3:40:53	f	and curve down to the leave 
3:41:2	3:41:8	f	ok 
3:46:5	3:46:6	f	mm Hmm 
3:46:7	3:46:7	g	so 
3:47:12	3:47:12	g	uhm 
3:48:2	3:48:11	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
3:49:43	3:49:47	g	and then 
3:50:32	3:50:41	g	uhm 
3:50:39	3:50:48	g	ok 
3:50:47	3:50:56	f	mm Hmm 
3:53:33	3:53:36	g	and then 
3:54:33	3:54:40	g	and be to the leave 
4:1:9	4:1:14	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
4:2:49	4:2:51	f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
4:5:45	4:5:47	g	maybe four inch on the paper 
4:7:26	4:7:33	g	ok 
4:8:29	4:8:29	f	ok 
4:8:29	4:8:33	g	no 
4:8:50	4:8:58	f	around the lake to the top 
4:8:59	4:9:5	g	three inch 
4:11:43	4:11:52	f	so wait 
4:12:11	4:12:17	f	ok 
4:12:54	4:12:54	g	Hmm 
4:13:44	4:13:49	g	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
4:15:12	4:15:18	g	a little bit too 
4:15:39	4:15:40	g	yes IY go towards the lake 
4:16:26	4:16:30	g	and then 
4:16:26	4:16:32	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
4:17:20	4:17:25	g	uhm 
4:18:58	4:18:58	g	IY move to the leave 
4:21:18	4:21:25	g	ok 
4:23:0	4:23:1	g	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
4:25:7	4:25:11	g	IY just kind of slope down 
4:25:9	4:25:12	g	so IY make circle 
4:26:40	4:26:44	g	uhm 
4:27:52	4:28:0	g	well alright 
4:28:39	4:28:45	g	well 
4:28:53	4:29:1	g	ok 
4:29:17	4:29:24	g	maybe 
4:29:26	4:29:34	g	ok 
4:29:58	4:30:0	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
4:30:16	4:30:16	g	uhm 
4:30:16	4:30:19	f	IY a plane crash though 
4:33:25	4:33:29	g	ok 
4:34:14	4:34:14	f	ok 
4:37:48	4:37:56	g	and 
4:38:11	4:38:16	g	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
4:38:30	4:38:37	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
4:39:22	4:39:31	g	be the plane crash 
4:39:30	4:39:37	g	probably the same thing 
4:40:24	4:40:32	g	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
4:42:2	4:42:9	g	ok 
4:42:37	4:42:45	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
4:43:33	4:43:38	g	go up like three three and a half inch 
4:44:40	4:44:48	g	IY go about 
4:44:52	4:44:52	g	have a s 
4:45:29	4:45:36	g	uhm and there be a stony desert 
4:46:0	4:46:9	g	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
4:46:2	4:46:11	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
4:48:33	4:48:35	g	like 
4:50:16	4:50:23	f	mm mm 
4:52:46	4:52:54	g	like 
4:53:1	4:53:3	f	yeah 
4:58:50	4:58:55	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY just ok 
4:59:54	5:0:2	f	ok 
5:0:12	5:0:18	f	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
5:0:56	5:0:57	g	a quarter of an inch 
5:1:19	5:1:26	g	ok and then IY go 
5:2:32	5:2:32	f	to the leave 
5:2:32	5:2:33	g	IY slope down again 
5:3:3	5:3:6	f	uh IY don know know what to say 
5:4:42	5:4:46	g	from 
5:6:24	5:6:32	f	nope 
5:7:41	5:7:46	g	and then 
5:8:7	5:8:15	f	IY know IY have different thing so 
5:8:28	5:8:30	g	uhhh no 
5:9:14	5:9:17	g	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
5:9:21	5:9:25	g	uhm 
5:9:50	5:9:54	g	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
5:12:1	5:12:4	g	maybe like 
5:15:32	5:15:37	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
5:16:54	5:17:0	f	oh 
5:19:50	5:19:56	g	and 
5:22:41	5:22:50	g	slight 
5:23:9	5:23:13	g	be IY 
5:25:4	5:25:8	f	and there a collapse shelter 
5:25:17	5:25:21	g	where IY go down to a plane crash 
5:27:22	5:27:22	f	to the right 
5:27:52	5:27:54	g	an inch maybe a little bit less 
5:28:38	5:28:45	g	and then 
5:29:35	5:29:42	g	and then IY go straight 
5:31:19	5:31:28	f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
5:33:6	5:33:12	g	IY start 
5:33:54	5:33:59	g	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
5:35:23	5:35:27	g	and then 
5:35:45	5:35:52	g	no there no elephant 
5:36:34	5:36:41	g	IY go like 
5:37:25	5:37:28	g	be IY in like almost the top of the 
5:37:26	5:37:33	g	IY slope 
5:37:33	5:37:39	f	yep 
5:37:39	5:37:41	g	ok well 
5:39:30	5:39:37	f	yeah 
5:39:33	5:39:38	g	ok 
5:40:26	5:40:31	g	that little slope 
5:42:16	5:42:18	g	ok 
5:42:13	5:42:19	g	ok 
5:42:39	5:42:47	g	alright 
5:43:0	5:43:0	g	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
5:43:5	5:43:10	g	uhm 
5:44:0	5:44:2	g	ok 
5:43:59	5:44:3	g	ok 
5:44:2	5:44:5	f	ok 
5:52:17	5:52:20	g	like an inch
