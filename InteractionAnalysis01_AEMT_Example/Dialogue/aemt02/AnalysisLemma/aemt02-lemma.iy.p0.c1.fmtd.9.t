2	0:3:19	0:3:21	Hmm 
4	0:3:30	0:3:36	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
5	0:4:8	0:4:11	well just 
6	0:4:10	0:4:16	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
7	0:6:2	0:6:9	the 
8	0:6:24	0:6:31	no 
9	0:7:44	0:7:52	IY make 
10	0:9:19	0:9:25	and IY go up like 
11	0:9:59	0:10:4	on sheet anyway 
13	0:17:43	0:17:43	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
14	0:22:38	0:22:41	for about two inch 
15	0:25:6	0:25:13	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
16	0:27:52	0:27:53	be IY in like almost the top of the 
17	0:28:33	0:28:37	maybe IY have different thing 
20	0:31:34	0:31:43	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
21	0:32:25	0:32:25	after IY slope down IY say 
23	0:34:22	0:34:23	a quarter of an inch 
24	0:34:33	0:34:39	and 
25	0:35:42	0:35:44	IY would say 
26	0:35:42	0:35:45	maybe 
28	0:38:25	0:38:34	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
29	0:40:3	0:40:5	yes 
30	0:42:47	0:42:51	uhm 
31	0:42:48	0:42:54	what 
33	0:45:41	0:45:42	be the plane crash 
34	0:48:1	0:48:6	uhm 
35	0:49:14	0:49:18	after plane crash 
36	0:50:12	0:50:21	uhm 
37	0:50:16	0:50:22	and then IY go down 
38	0:50:31	0:50:32	IY at the plane crash 
39	0:51:48	0:51:51	ok IY at the savannah 
41	0:52:44	0:52:46	ok well 
42	0:53:21	0:53:21	ok 
43	0:53:30	0:53:30	alright 
45	0:55:48	0:55:55	well alright 
47	0:56:47	0:56:56	like four or five inch to the leave 
48	0:57:4	0:57:12	ok 
50	0:57:44	0:57:49	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
51	0:57:51	0:57:58	and then 
56	1:3:28	1:3:34	four or five inch to the leave 
57	1:4:8	1:4:11	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
59	1:6:4	1:6:12	like maybe an inch 
60	1:6:58	1:6:58	IY start 
61	1:7:29	1:7:35	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
62	1:7:35	1:7:44	but 
63	1:8:8	1:8:13	and slope be about an inch long 
65	1:10:3	1:10:5	it not a big curve 
66	1:12:29	1:12:38	maybe like 
67	1:13:54	1:13:54	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
68	1:14:14	1:14:14	uhm 
71	1:16:52	1:17:1	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
72	1:17:23	1:17:27	IY don know 
73	1:18:20	1:18:20	no there no elephant 
74	1:20:26	1:20:31	ok 
75	1:21:37	1:21:40	IY slope 
80	1:22:50	1:22:55	and then 
81	1:23:28	1:23:31	IY actually start like right 
84	1:24:54	1:24:57	and that where the plane crash be 
86	1:26:3	1:26:8	and then 
87	1:26:19	1:26:28	uhm 
89	1:29:42	1:29:43	ok 
90	1:31:31	1:31:33	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
91	1:33:16	1:33:16	just a slight slope 
92	1:33:46	1:33:47	so IY at the hot spring 
95	1:34:38	1:34:45	and then 
96	1:36:50	1:36:50	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
98	1:38:45	1:38:49	ok 
100	1:39:9	1:39:17	uhm IY straighten out slope 
101	1:42:49	1:42:57	like an inch 
103	1:44:14	1:44:16	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
104	1:48:32	1:48:34	around the bottom of it 
105	1:49:16	1:49:17	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
106	1:49:26	1:49:26	ok 
110	1:51:59	1:52:2	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
111	1:53:7	1:53:11	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
112	1:53:17	1:53:18	probably the same thing 
114	1:53:58	1:54:1	IY have a waterhole on map 
115	1:56:11	1:56:20	an inch maybe a little bit less 
116	1:56:20	1:56:29	ok 
119	1:56:45	1:56:50	ok 
120	1:56:55	1:57:0	IY kind of go 
124	2:5:15	2:5:16	and then IY slope up 
126	2:6:13	2:6:20	to the lake 
127	2:6:44	2:6:52	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
129	2:7:29	2:7:36	no IY don have a waterhole 
130	2:7:36	2:7:42	well 
131	2:9:51	2:9:53	ok 
132	2:10:20	2:10:25	uh like

137	2:15:26	2:15:34	uhm 
138	2:16:6	2:16:9	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
140	2:16:41	2:16:48	uhm 
142	2:17:50	2:17:58	then 
143	2:18:0	2:18:1	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
145	2:19:35	2:19:36	so anyway 
146	2:25:3	2:25:5	no IY have 
147	2:25:54	2:25:56	so IY make circle 
148	2:25:55	2:25:56	alright well IY keep go and see 
149	2:31:11	2:31:18	there a there 
150	2:31:19	2:31:24	like three inch 
151	2:33:49	2:33:52	and then 
152	2:34:49	2:34:52	couple mile or something 
155	2:37:18	2:37:26	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
156	2:40:36	2:40:44	uhm and there be a stony desert 
157	2:41:10	2:41:14	uhm 
158	2:41:56	2:42:1	ok 
162	2:49:24	2:49:25	right next to circle should be roman bath 
164	2:55:57	2:55:57	ok 
165	2:56:22	2:56:23	IY go about 
166	2:58:51	2:58:51	yes 
167	3:0:4	3:0:7	ok plane crash isn there 
168	3:0:42	3:0:48	it right next to it 
170	3:4:40	3:4:41	and then IY slope 
171	3:5:14	3:5:20	no IY don have any rock 
172	3:6:24	3:6:24	ok 
173	3:7:11	3:7:12	alright be IY start near the 
174	3:9:16	3:9:25	maybe four inch on the paper 
175	3:9:33	3:9:36	IY just kind of slope down 
176	3:10:4	3:10:13	have a s 
179	3:12:9	3:12:13	and 
180	3:14:37	3:14:38	and then IY come to a savannah 
181	3:14:48	3:14:53	no 
182	3:14:59	3:15:6	and 
183	3:16:53	3:16:57	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
185	3:20:47	3:20:51	ok 
186	3:22:19	3:22:21	and then 
189	3:25:6	3:25:9	to the leave 
190	3:25:25	3:25:30	to the leave of little path where path should be 
191	3:25:38	3:25:44	and then 
193	3:27:18	3:27:26	and then IY go straight 
194	3:27:41	3:27:50	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
195	3:29:42	3:29:42	like 
196	3:30:3	3:30:4	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
197	3:34:40	3:34:48	and then IY go 
199	3:35:57	3:36:5	where IY go down to a plane crash 
200	3:38:13	3:38:19	IY move to the leave 
201	3:39:5	3:39:6	and IY go straight up 
203	3:40:29	3:40:29	after the circle 
204	3:43:24	3:43:33	and then IY slope down to the leave 
207	3:49:21	3:49:23	after IY go straight again 
208	3:49:47	3:49:49	to right 
209	3:50:29	3:50:36	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
211	3:52:36	3:52:41	and IY just go straight up 
212	3:52:41	3:52:48	alright alright well just 
214	3:54:57	3:55:1	five 
215	3:55:59	3:56:1	IY get 
216	3:56:3	3:56:11	IY 
217	3:57:57	3:58:6	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
218	3:58:8	3:58:15	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
219	3:59:10	3:59:12	uhm 
221	4:1:0	4:1:7	yes IY go towards the lake 
222	4:1:42	4:1:42	and IY go 
223	4:2:27	4:2:34	uhm 
224	4:5:48	4:5:54	not right at the stony desert 
225	4:8:20	4:8:26	slight 
226	4:10:23	4:10:27	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
228	4:11:49	4:11:54	now IY at the collapse shelter 
229	4:11:54	4:12:0	ok 
230	4:12:2	4:12:6	what 
231	4:15:15	4:15:23	and IY should have a straight line there 
232	4:17:47	4:17:56	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
233	4:19:24	4:19:26	and IY slope to the leave 
234	4:20:12	4:20:19	like 
235	4:20:48	4:20:52	uhhh no 
236	4:21:47	4:21:49	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
238	4:26:45	4:26:46	so that about IY would say 
240	4:27:45	4:27:48	IY slope down again 
241	4:28:30	4:28:39	IY just go down 
242	4:30:55	4:31:3	ok 
243	4:32:7	4:32:8	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
244	4:34:12	4:34:17	and 
245	4:35:55	4:35:59	and it slope a little bit to the right 
246	4:36:45	4:36:45	and then IY be 
248	4:38:34	4:38:39	and then IY you go up 
249	4:39:0	4:39:3	straight up 
251	4:40:32	4:40:37	ok 
253	4:42:40	4:42:47	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
255	4:43:25	4:43:29	like IY slope 
257	4:46:53	4:47:0	for like 
258	4:47:17	4:47:18	plane crash 
259	4:47:13	4:47:19	kind of across from stony desert 
260	4:47:16	4:47:22	be IY anywere near there 
261	4:49:16	4:49:16	like 
262	4:49:47	4:49:50	uhm 
263	4:49:43	4:49:52	for like 
264	4:51:12	4:51:21	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
267	4:53:37	4:53:39	that about five or six inch 
268	4:55:27	4:55:29	away about like four inch four or five inch

277	5:5:55	5:6:3	ok 
278	5:6:43	5:6:44	from 
279	5:8:21	5:8:23	to the white mountain 
280	5:12:25	5:12:34	a little 
281	5:13:43	5:13:50	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
282	5:15:20	5:15:22	ok 
283	5:16:8	5:16:8	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
284	5:16:15	5:16:22	ok well 
285	5:17:8	5:17:12	to the leave 
286	5:18:18	5:18:26	do IY have roman bath 
287	5:19:12	5:19:14	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
288	5:19:45	5:19:52	so IY go three inch straight 
289	5:22:20	5:22:24	just do it like this ok 
292	5:25:50	5:25:57	IY go straight down 
293	5:28:30	5:28:39	be IY anywhere near there 
294	5:33:14	5:33:23	to the right 
295	5:34:5	5:34:13	three inch 
296	5:35:16	5:35:19	and then 
297	5:36:22	5:36:24	IY start at the stony desert 
298	5:36:51	5:36:53	go up like three three and a half inch 
299	5:39:5	5:39:11	to the leave 
300	5:39:19	5:39:27	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
301	5:41:28	5:41:28	ok 
302	5:42:58	5:43:1	uhm 
303	5:44:21	5:44:21	like 
305	5:45:32	5:45:35	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
306	5:49:23	5:49:30	IY go like 
308	5:50:28	5:50:28	uhm 
310	5:58:5	5:58:12	ok

324	6:10:58	6:10:59	uhm 
325	6:12:24	6:12:29	and there a plane crash 
327	6:13:57	6:14:1	the slate mountain be towards the right 
328	6:14:17	6:14:17	be IY 
329	6:14:10	6:14:19	uhm 
331	6:16:7	6:16:16	IY wanna kind of curve 
332	6:16:28	6:16:33	ok 
333	6:16:50	6:16:59	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
334	6:17:18	6:17:24	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
336	6:18:34	6:18:38	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
338	6:20:44	6:20:44	ok 
339	6:21:1	6:21:1	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
340	6:21:35	6:21:37	couple inch IY slope down 
341	6:21:59	6:22:8	ok 
342	6:22:7	6:22:10	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
start f
3	0:3:27	0:3:34	mm Hmm 
12	0:17:29	0:17:38	nope IY have a white mountain 
18	0:29:49	0:29:50	IY plane crash IY be talk about earlier that up there 
19	0:31:39	0:31:42	up tp the right 
22	0:33:19	0:33:19	IY a plane crash though 
27	0:38:13	0:38:17	mm Hmm 
32	0:44:24	0:44:33	ok 
40	0:52:26	0:52:34	ok 
44	0:53:28	0:53:37	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
46	0:56:11	0:56:19	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
49	0:57:22	0:57:22	to the leave of the antelope 
52	0:57:58	0:58:4	yeah 
53	1:1:35	1:1:42	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
54	1:2:10	1:2:17	and to the right 
55	1:3:2	1:3:2	ok wait hold on 
58	1:5:43	1:5:51	ok 
64	1:8:10	1:8:17	do IY go by the plane crash 
69	1:14:7	1:14:14	mm Hmm 
70	1:16:23	1:16:29	ok 
76	1:22:1	1:22:1	ok

136	2:14:0	2:14:6	ok 
139	2:16:28	2:16:33	plane crash be on the other side but IY just ok 
141	2:16:58	2:17:7	ok 
144	2:19:6	2:19:14	IY have to back up a little bit

160	2:46:4	2:46:12	to the right 
161	2:46:46	2:46:46	IY three inch above the savannah 
163	2:53:54	2:53:57	plane crash IY don think be yeah 
169	3:1:23	3:1:32	ok 
177	3:10:38	3:10:41	uh IY don know know what to say

275	5:2:9	5:2:16	and there a collapse shelter 
290	5:25:16	5:25:20	and curve down to the leave 
291	5:25:28	5:25:37	ok 
304	5:44:51	5:44:54	ok

321	6:6:49	6:6:51	how many inch do IY think 
326	6:13:11	6:13:20	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash 
330	6:15:25	6:15:27	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
335	6:17:56	6:18:2	yeah 
337	6:19:50	6:19:52	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
start g

2	0:3:19	0:3:21	Hmm 
4	0:3:30	0:3:36	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
5	0:4:8	0:4:11	well just 
6	0:4:10	0:4:16	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
7	0:6:2	0:6:9	the 
8	0:6:24	0:6:31	no 
9	0:7:44	0:7:52	IY make

14	0:22:38	0:22:41	for about two inch 
15	0:25:6	0:25:13	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
16	0:27:52	0:27:53	be IY in like almost the top of the 
17	0:28:33	0:28:37	maybe IY have different thing 
20	0:31:34	0:31:43	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
21	0:32:25	0:32:25	after IY slope down IY say 
23	0:34:22	0:34:23	a quarter of an inch 
24	0:34:33	0:34:39	and 
25	0:35:42	0:35:44	IY would say 
26	0:35:42	0:35:45	maybe 
28	0:38:25	0:38:34	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
29	0:40:3	0:40:5	yes 
30	0:42:47	0:42:51	uhm 
31	0:42:48	0:42:54	what 
33	0:45:41	0:45:42	be the plane crash 
34	0:48:1	0:48:6	uhm 
35	0:49:14	0:49:18	after plane crash 
36	0:50:12	0:50:21	uhm 
37	0:50:16	0:50:22	and then IY go down 
38	0:50:31	0:50:32	IY at the plane crash 
39	0:51:48	0:51:51	ok IY at the savannah 
41	0:52:44	0:52:46	ok well 
42	0:53:21	0:53:21	ok 
43	0:53:30	0:53:30	alright 
45	0:55:48	0:55:55	well alright

48	0:57:4	0:57:12	ok 
50	0:57:44	0:57:49	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
51	0:57:51	0:57:58	and then 
56	1:3:28	1:3:34	four or five inch to the leave 
57	1:4:8	1:4:11	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
59	1:6:4	1:6:12	like maybe an inch 
60	1:6:58	1:6:58	IY start 
61	1:7:29	1:7:35	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
62	1:7:35	1:7:44	but 
63	1:8:8	1:8:13	and slope be about an inch long 
65	1:10:3	1:10:5	it not a big curve 
66	1:12:29	1:12:38	maybe like 
67	1:13:54	1:13:54	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
68	1:14:14	1:14:14	uhm 
71	1:16:52	1:17:1	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
72	1:17:23	1:17:27	IY don know 
73	1:18:20	1:18:20	no there no elephant 
74	1:20:26	1:20:31	ok 
75	1:21:37	1:21:40	IY slope 
80	1:22:50	1:22:55	and then 
81	1:23:28	1:23:31	IY actually start like right 
84	1:24:54	1:24:57	and that where the plane crash be 
86	1:26:3	1:26:8	and then 
87	1:26:19	1:26:28	uhm 
89	1:29:42	1:29:43	ok 
90	1:31:31	1:31:33	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
91	1:33:16	1:33:16	just a slight slope 
92	1:33:46	1:33:47	so IY at the hot spring 
95	1:34:38	1:34:45	and then 
96	1:36:50	1:36:50	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
98	1:38:45	1:38:49	ok 
100	1:39:9	1:39:17	uhm IY straighten out slope 
101	1:42:49	1:42:57	like an inch 
103	1:44:14	1:44:16	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
104	1:48:32	1:48:34	around the bottom of it 
105	1:49:16	1:49:17	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
106	1:49:26	1:49:26	ok 
110	1:51:59	1:52:2	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
111	1:53:7	1:53:11	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
112	1:53:17	1:53:18	probably the same thing 
114	1:53:58	1:54:1	IY have a waterhole on map 
115	1:56:11	1:56:20	an inch maybe a little bit less 
116	1:56:20	1:56:29	ok 
119	1:56:45	1:56:50	ok 
120	1:56:55	1:57:0	IY kind of go 
124	2:5:15	2:5:16	and then IY slope up 
126	2:6:13	2:6:20	to the lake 
127	2:6:44	2:6:52	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
129	2:7:29	2:7:36	no IY don have a waterhole 
130	2:7:36	2:7:42	well 
131	2:9:51	2:9:53	ok 
132	2:10:20	2:10:25	uh like

146	2:25:3	2:25:5	no IY have 
147	2:25:54	2:25:56	so IY make circle 
148	2:25:55	2:25:56	alright well IY keep go and see 
149	2:31:11	2:31:18	there a there 
150	2:31:19	2:31:24	like three inch

166	2:58:51	2:58:51	yes 
167	3:0:4	3:0:7	ok plane crash isn there 
168	3:0:42	3:0:48	it right next to it 
170	3:4:40	3:4:41	and then IY slope 
171	3:5:14	3:5:20	no IY don have any rock

182	3:14:59	3:15:6	and 
183	3:16:53	3:16:57	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
185	3:20:47	3:20:51	ok 
186	3:22:19	3:22:21	and then 
189	3:25:6	3:25:9	to the leave 
190	3:25:25	3:25:30	to the leave of little path where path should be 
191	3:25:38	3:25:44	and then 
193	3:27:18	3:27:26	and then IY go straight 
194	3:27:41	3:27:50	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight

196	3:30:3	3:30:4	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
197	3:34:40	3:34:48	and then IY go 
199	3:35:57	3:36:5	where IY go down to a plane crash 
200	3:38:13	3:38:19	IY move to the leave 
201	3:39:5	3:39:6	and IY go straight up 
203	3:40:29	3:40:29	after the circle 
204	3:43:24	3:43:33	and then IY slope down to the leave 
207	3:49:21	3:49:23	after IY go straight again 
208	3:49:47	3:49:49	to right 
209	3:50:29	3:50:36	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
211	3:52:36	3:52:41	and IY just go straight up 
212	3:52:41	3:52:48	alright alright well just 
214	3:54:57	3:55:1	five

216	3:56:3	3:56:11	IY 
217	3:57:57	3:58:6	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
218	3:58:8	3:58:15	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
219	3:59:10	3:59:12	uhm 
221	4:1:0	4:1:7	yes IY go towards the lake 
222	4:1:42	4:1:42	and IY go

228	4:11:49	4:11:54	now IY at the collapse shelter 
229	4:11:54	4:12:0	ok 
230	4:12:2	4:12:6	what 
231	4:15:15	4:15:23	and IY should have a straight line there

242	4:30:55	4:31:3	ok 
243	4:32:7	4:32:8	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
244	4:34:12	4:34:17	and 
245	4:35:55	4:35:59	and it slope a little bit to the right 
246	4:36:45	4:36:45	and then IY be 
248	4:38:34	4:38:39	and then IY you go up

251	4:40:32	4:40:37	ok 
253	4:42:40	4:42:47	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
255	4:43:25	4:43:29	like IY slope 
257	4:46:53	4:47:0	for like 
258	4:47:17	4:47:18	plane crash 
259	4:47:13	4:47:19	kind of across from stony desert 
260	4:47:16	4:47:22	be IY anywere near there 
261	4:49:16	4:49:16	like 
262	4:49:47	4:49:50	uhm

278	5:6:43	5:6:44	from 
279	5:8:21	5:8:23	to the white mountain 
280	5:12:25	5:12:34	a little 
281	5:13:43	5:13:50	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
282	5:15:20	5:15:22	ok 
283	5:16:8	5:16:8	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
284	5:16:15	5:16:22	ok well 
285	5:17:8	5:17:12	to the leave 
286	5:18:18	5:18:26	do IY have roman bath 
287	5:19:12	5:19:14	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
288	5:19:45	5:19:52	so IY go three inch straight 
289	5:22:20	5:22:24	just do it like this ok 
292	5:25:50	5:25:57	IY go straight down 
293	5:28:30	5:28:39	be IY anywhere near there 
294	5:33:14	5:33:23	to the right 
295	5:34:5	5:34:13	three inch 
296	5:35:16	5:35:19	and then 
297	5:36:22	5:36:24	IY start at the stony desert 
298	5:36:51	5:36:53	go up like three three and a half inch 
299	5:39:5	5:39:11	to the leave 
300	5:39:19	5:39:27	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
301	5:41:28	5:41:28	ok 
302	5:42:58	5:43:1	uhm 
303	5:44:21	5:44:21	like 
305	5:45:32	5:45:35	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
306	5:49:23	5:49:30	IY go like 
308	5:50:28	5:50:28	uhm 
310	5:58:5	5:58:12	ok

324	6:10:58	6:10:59	uhm
