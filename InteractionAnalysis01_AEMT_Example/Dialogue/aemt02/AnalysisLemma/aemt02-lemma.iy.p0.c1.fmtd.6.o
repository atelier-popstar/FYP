start
0:1:11	0:1:11	g	and then IY be 
0:1:56	0:2:2	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
0:2:7	0:2:11	g	what 
0:2:49	0:2:51	g	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
0:2:50	0:2:56	g	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
0:3:46	0:3:54	g	no IY don have any rock 
0:5:8	0:5:12	g	well 
0:7:2	0:7:3	f	ok 
0:7:43	0:7:49	g	ok well 
0:9:26	0:9:30	g	after IY slope down IY say 
0:10:24	0:10:25	g	so IY make circle 
0:10:26	0:10:32	g	well 
0:11:52	0:11:53	g	and there a plane crash 
0:11:57	0:12:5	g	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
0:12:15	0:12:22	g	IY have a waterhole on map 
0:12:51	0:12:52	g	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
0:13:14	0:13:17	f	ok 
0:13:23	0:13:31	g	so that about IY would say 
0:14:46	0:14:49	g	and then IY you go up 
0:16:17	0:16:26	g	what 
0:18:2	0:18:5	g	ok

0:22:13	0:22:21	f	ok 
0:22:48	0:22:49	g	and be to the leave 
0:25:48	0:25:53	g	the 
0:26:1	0:26:9	g	ok and then IY go 
0:26:12	0:26:15	g	ok 
0:27:56	0:28:5	g	and that where the plane crash be 
0:32:0	0:32:6	g	ok 
0:35:27	0:35:36	g	that little slope 
0:35:39	0:35:39	g	now IY at the collapse shelter 
0:36:22	0:36:22	g	and then 
0:37:42	0:37:48	g	to the leave 
0:38:59	0:39:5	g	plane crash 
0:39:56	0:40:2	g	like 
0:41:27	0:41:35	f	ok 
0:43:16	0:43:23	g	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
0:43:21	0:43:24	f	ok 
0:44:5	0:44:11	f	do IY go through anything 
0:44:24	0:44:30	g	and IY go straight up 
0:45:24	0:45:32	f	IY have to back up a little bit 
0:45:46	0:45:53	g	maybe like 
0:49:25	0:49:27	g	they there 
0:51:26	0:51:31	f	so wait 
0:51:33	0:51:38	g	three inch 
0:52:6	0:52:9	g	be IY 
0:53:0	0:53:5	g	around the bottom of it 
0:53:2	0:53:7	g	uhm 
0:55:43	0:55:51	g	ok 
0:58:49	0:58:55	g	uhm 
1:0:35	1:0:38	g	like three inch 
1:2:31	1:2:36	f	to 
1:3:54	1:3:54	g	IY start at the stony desert 
1:6:57	1:6:59	g	probably the same thing 
1:8:27	1:8:32	g	for like 
1:9:8	1:9:14	f	and curve down to the leave 
1:9:20	1:9:22	g	ok IY at the savannah 
1:12:40	1:12:40	g	uhm 
1:14:25	1:14:27	g	ok 
1:14:48	1:14:48	g	well alright

1:23:42	1:23:51	f	yeah 
1:26:46	1:26:50	g	so 
1:28:19	1:28:20	g	maybe like 
1:30:4	1:30:11	g	five 
1:32:10	1:32:11	f	yeah 
1:33:3	1:33:10	g	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
1:34:42	1:34:42	g	like maybe an inch 
1:35:6	1:35:11	g	IY 
1:35:6	1:35:14	g	ok 
1:36:27	1:36:35	f	oh 
1:36:32	1:36:40	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
1:36:46	1:36:46	g	ok 
1:38:4	1:38:5	g	and then IY slope down to the leave 
1:39:28	1:39:33	g	and IY just go straight up 
1:39:53	1:39:57	f	it not like in the same place IY describe 
1:40:22	1:40:25	g	ok 
1:40:55	1:40:56	g	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
1:44:26	1:44:30	g	IY kind of go 
1:44:59	1:45:5	g	and 
1:45:18	1:45:18	f	uh IY don know know what to say 
1:45:28	1:45:28	g	ok 
1:49:18	1:49:24	g	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
1:50:20	1:50:21	g	there a there 
1:52:18	1:52:24	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
1:53:33	1:53:34	g	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
1:56:32	1:56:33	f	ok 
1:56:46	1:56:53	g	IY just kind of slope down 
1:57:12	1:57:14	f	no IY go with hot spring IY have 
2:1:35	2:1:41	g	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
2:2:1	2:2:7	g	uhm 
2:3:7	2:3:12	g	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
2:5:5	2:5:8	f	mm Hmm 
2:5:10	2:5:15	f	ok 
2:5:15	2:5:20	f	mm Hmm 
2:5:21	2:5:29	g	no there no elephant 
2:7:16	2:7:24	f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
2:7:41	2:7:43	g	to the lake 
2:10:59	2:10:59	g	ok 
2:11:44	2:11:46	g	a quarter of an inch 
2:11:46	2:11:55	g	and then 
2:12:7	2:12:7	g	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
2:12:6	2:12:14	g	IY get 
2:13:38	2:13:47	g	like 
2:15:19	2:15:27	g	IY wanna kind of curve 
2:17:43	2:17:49	f	ok 
2:18:57	2:19:4	g	be IY in like 
2:19:35	2:19:44	f	IY at the savannah 
2:22:5	2:22:8	g	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
2:22:52	2:22:56	g	uhm 
2:23:30	2:23:37	f	to the right 
2:24:41	2:24:42	f	IY hit some rock though 
2:27:15	2:27:23	f	IY three inch above the savannah 
2:28:6	2:28:7	g	after IY go straight again 
2:29:54	2:29:59	g	ok 
2:32:49	2:32:57	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
2:33:45	2:33:47	g	uhm 
2:34:16	2:34:23	g	alright 
2:34:39	2:34:44	g	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
2:35:4	2:35:8	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
2:35:19	2:35:23	f	IY go to a lake 
2:36:31	2:36:31	g	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
2:37:2	2:37:2	f	mm Hmm 
2:37:37	2:37:43	f	and 
2:37:51	2:37:51	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
2:37:45	2:37:51	g	IY go about 
2:40:50	2:40:52	f	ok 
2:41:16	2:41:17	g	couple mile or something 
2:41:30	2:41:32	f	IY plane crash IY be talk about earlier that up there 
2:42:51	2:42:57	f	IY a plane crash though 
2:43:29	2:43:29	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
2:43:55	2:43:56	g	and IY go 
2:45:0	2:45:7	g	an inch maybe a little bit less 
2:47:23	2:47:27	g	and then IY slope up 
2:48:23	2:48:30	f	yeah 
2:48:49	2:48:54	g	like 
2:49:14	2:49:20	g	uhm 
2:49:36	2:49:40	g	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
2:50:15	2:50:19	g	no 
2:51:9	2:51:14	g	just a slight slope 
2:53:57	2:53:57	g	uhm

2:55:20	2:55:23	f	and then what 
2:59:42	2:59:42	g	uhm and there be a stony desert 
3:1:8	3:1:10	g	couple inch IY slope down 
3:1:55	3:2:3	g	so IY at the hot spring 
3:2:10	3:2:16	f	to the leave of the antelope 
3:2:31	3:2:40	g	ok 
3:3:18	3:3:26	g	like 
3:3:32	3:3:38	g	and

3:5:33	3:5:36	g	ok 
3:5:44	3:5:47	f	ok 
3:5:41	3:5:50	f	around the top of the lake 
3:8:8	3:8:14	g	ok 
3:9:54	3:9:56	g	straight up 
3:10:58	3:11:3	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
3:13:28	3:13:35	g	ok 
3:13:42	3:13:49	g	ok 
3:14:8	3:14:9	f	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
3:14:36	3:14:39	f	ok 
3:18:35	3:18:42	g	ok 
3:20:42	3:20:51	g	for like 
3:20:57	3:21:3	g	uhm 
3:21:9	3:21:18	g	like IY slope 
3:21:40	3:21:46	g	ok 
3:23:25	3:23:33	g	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
3:23:31	3:23:39	g	yes 
3:23:59	3:24:0	f	yeah 
3:24:6	3:24:10	g	IY make 
3:24:45	3:24:53	f	ok 
3:26:15	3:26:18	g	after plane crash 
3:27:23	3:27:32	g	away about like four inch four or five inch 
3:28:59	3:29:4	g	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
3:30:12	3:30:21	f	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
3:30:53	3:31:0	f	yeah IY see 
3:31:7	3:31:11	g	and then IY slope 
3:34:2	3:34:4	g	ok 
3:33:59	3:34:5	g	four or five inch to the leave 
3:34:20	3:34:20	g	and then 
3:34:38	3:34:46	g	so IY go three inch straight 
3:34:45	3:34:49	g	like four or five inch to the leave 
3:35:9	3:35:18	f	mm mm 
3:35:21	3:35:29	f	ok 
3:36:57	3:37:5	g	alright 
3:37:8	3:37:10	f	around the lake to the top 
3:37:49	3:37:56	g	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
3:38:12	3:38:21	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY just ok 
3:38:58	3:39:1	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
3:39:0	3:39:8	g	IY don know 
3:39:24	3:39:24	g	not right at the stony desert 
3:40:57	3:41:1	g	and then 
3:41:16	3:41:17	f	ok 
3:42:26	3:42:26	f	mm Hmm 
3:43:5	3:43:10	g	uhm 
3:44:1	3:44:4	g	like an inch 
3:45:9	3:45:13	f	ok 
3:46:1	3:46:6	g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
3:46:35	3:46:35	g	uhm 
3:47:7	3:47:10	g	and then IY go down 
3:47:53	3:47:58	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
3:51:11	3:51:12	g	it not a big curve 
3:51:16	3:51:21	f	elephant 
3:54:52	3:54:59	g	a little 
3:59:40	3:59:49	g	to right

4:1:40	4:1:43	g	alright alright well just 
4:3:55	4:4:4	g	uhm 
4:7:3	4:7:6	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
4:7:8	4:7:10	g	a little bit too 
4:7:48	4:7:50	g	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
4:9:44	4:9:49	g	uh like 
4:9:54	4:9:57	g	no IY don have a waterhole 
4:13:41	4:13:44	g	alright be IY start near the 
4:15:0	4:15:0	g	be the plane crash 
4:14:58	4:15:2	g	maybe four inch on the paper 
4:15:11	4:15:17	g	do IY have roman bath 
4:15:23	4:15:24	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
4:16:20	4:16:29	g	ok 
4:17:36	4:17:39	g	be IY anywere near there 
4:18:30	4:18:32	g	yes 
4:18:59	4:19:7	g	ok plane crash isn there 
4:19:8	4:19:11	f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
4:22:24	4:22:24	g	uhm IY straighten out slope 
4:22:52	4:22:58	f	up tp the right 
4:25:3	4:25:8	f	to the leave 
4:25:36	4:25:38	g	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
4:26:43	4:26:51	f	ok 
4:28:42	4:28:48	g	Hmm 
4:29:6	4:29:11	g	for about two inch 
4:30:7	4:30:14	f	do IY go around it 
4:31:54	4:31:55	g	ok 
4:32:32	4:32:39	f	IY know IY have different thing so 
4:32:43	4:32:52	g	the slate mountain be towards the right 
4:34:43	4:34:52	g	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
4:37:6	4:37:13	g	three inch 
4:38:17	4:38:26	g	where IY go down to a plane crash 
4:40:39	4:40:45	g	kind of across from stony desert 
4:41:0	4:41:8	g	uhhh no 
4:41:59	4:41:59	g	IY just go down 
4:42:30	4:42:39	g	and 
4:42:36	4:42:44	f	and to the right 
4:45:30	4:45:38	f	ok 
4:46:11	4:46:20	f	ok

4:51:43	4:51:52	g	just do it like this ok 
4:52:0	4:52:7	g	to the leave 
4:52:34	4:52:36	g	and then IY come to a savannah 
4:52:59	4:52:59	g	on sheet anyway 
4:52:55	4:53:2	g	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
4:54:10	4:54:14	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
4:54:48	4:54:51	g	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
4:55:9	4:55:12	f	mm Hmm 
4:55:48	4:55:49	g	IY actually start like right 
4:55:44	4:55:53	g	IY slope 
4:56:30	4:56:32	g	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
4:57:13	4:57:19	g	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
4:58:19	4:58:28	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
4:58:32	4:58:40	g	it right next to it 
5:0:55	5:1:3	f	plane crash IY don think be yeah 
5:1:59	5:2:1	f	yeah 
5:2:47	5:2:53	g	yes IY go towards the lake 
5:3:25	5:3:26	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything

5:11:59	5:12:6	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
5:12:52	5:12:57	g	then 
5:13:7	5:13:9	g	be IY anywhere near there 
5:13:9	5:13:17	g	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
5:13:44	5:13:51	g	and then 
5:13:59	5:14:1	g	after the circle 
5:15:9	5:15:10	g	IY at the plane crash 
5:15:6	5:15:12	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
5:15:41	5:15:45	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
5:17:32	5:17:40	g	maybe IY have different thing 
5:17:57	5:18:6	f	ok 
5:19:23	5:19:32	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
5:20:58	5:21:2	f	yeah 
5:21:24	5:21:27	g	and slope be about an inch long 
5:23:7	5:23:12	f	ok 
5:24:26	5:24:29	g	ok 
5:24:50	5:24:53	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
5:25:37	5:25:38	g	and IY go up like 
5:26:49	5:26:52	g	go up like three three and a half inch 
5:26:49	5:26:55	f	and there a collapse shelter 
5:31:52	5:32:0	g	uhm 
5:34:42	5:34:43	f	ok 
5:34:38	5:34:47	g	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
5:35:6	5:35:10	g	and IY slope to the leave 
5:35:12	5:35:12	g	to the leave 
5:35:11	5:35:20	g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
5:36:32	5:36:39	g	IY move to the leave 
5:36:53	5:36:59	g	three inch straight across 
5:36:55	5:37:3	g	ok well 
5:42:54	5:43:0	g	IY go like
