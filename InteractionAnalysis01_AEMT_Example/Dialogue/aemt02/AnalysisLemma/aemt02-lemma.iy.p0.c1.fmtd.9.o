start
0:0:36	0:0:44	g	ok 
0:1:13	0:1:13	g	uhm 
0:3:19	0:3:21	g	Hmm 
0:3:27	0:3:34	f	mm Hmm 
0:3:30	0:3:36	g	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
0:4:8	0:4:11	g	well just 
0:4:10	0:4:16	g	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
0:6:2	0:6:9	g	the 
0:6:24	0:6:31	g	no 
0:7:44	0:7:52	g	IY make 
0:9:19	0:9:25	g	and IY go up like 
0:9:59	0:10:4	g	on sheet anyway 
0:17:29	0:17:38	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
0:17:43	0:17:43	g	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
0:22:38	0:22:41	g	for about two inch 
0:25:6	0:25:13	g	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
0:27:52	0:27:53	g	be IY in like almost the top of the 
0:28:33	0:28:37	g	maybe IY have different thing 
0:29:49	0:29:50	f	IY plane crash IY be talk about earlier that up there 
0:31:39	0:31:42	f	up tp the right 
0:31:34	0:31:43	g	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
0:32:25	0:32:25	g	after IY slope down IY say 
0:33:19	0:33:19	f	IY a plane crash though 
0:34:22	0:34:23	g	a quarter of an inch 
0:34:33	0:34:39	g	and 
0:35:42	0:35:44	g	IY would say 
0:35:42	0:35:45	g	maybe 
0:38:13	0:38:17	f	mm Hmm 
0:38:25	0:38:34	g	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
0:40:3	0:40:5	g	yes 
0:42:47	0:42:51	g	uhm 
0:42:48	0:42:54	g	what 
0:44:24	0:44:33	f	ok 
0:45:41	0:45:42	g	be the plane crash 
0:48:1	0:48:6	g	uhm 
0:49:14	0:49:18	g	after plane crash 
0:50:12	0:50:21	g	uhm 
0:50:16	0:50:22	g	and then IY go down 
0:50:31	0:50:32	g	IY at the plane crash 
0:51:48	0:51:51	g	ok IY at the savannah 
0:52:26	0:52:34	f	ok 
0:52:44	0:52:46	g	ok well 
0:53:21	0:53:21	g	ok 
0:53:30	0:53:30	g	alright 
0:53:28	0:53:37	f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
0:55:48	0:55:55	g	well alright 
0:56:11	0:56:19	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
0:56:47	0:56:56	g	like four or five inch to the leave 
0:57:4	0:57:12	g	ok 
0:57:22	0:57:22	f	to the leave of the antelope 
0:57:44	0:57:49	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
0:57:51	0:57:58	g	and then 
0:57:58	0:58:4	f	yeah 
1:1:35	1:1:42	f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
1:2:10	1:2:17	f	and to the right 
1:3:2	1:3:2	f	ok wait hold on 
1:3:28	1:3:34	g	four or five inch to the leave 
1:4:8	1:4:11	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
1:5:43	1:5:51	f	ok 
1:6:4	1:6:12	g	like maybe an inch 
1:6:58	1:6:58	g	IY start 
1:7:29	1:7:35	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
1:7:35	1:7:44	g	but 
1:8:8	1:8:13	g	and slope be about an inch long 
1:8:10	1:8:17	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
1:10:3	1:10:5	g	it not a big curve 
1:12:29	1:12:38	g	maybe like 
1:13:54	1:13:54	g	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
1:14:14	1:14:14	g	uhm 
1:14:7	1:14:14	f	mm Hmm 
1:16:23	1:16:29	f	ok 
1:16:52	1:17:1	g	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
1:17:23	1:17:27	g	IY don know 
1:18:20	1:18:20	g	no there no elephant 
1:20:26	1:20:31	g	ok 
1:21:37	1:21:40	g	IY slope 
1:22:1	1:22:1	f	ok 
1:21:56	1:22:1	f	yeah 
1:22:31	1:22:32	f	and then what 
1:22:25	1:22:34	f	around the top of the lake 
1:22:50	1:22:55	g	and then 
1:23:28	1:23:31	g	IY actually start like right 
1:23:40	1:23:41	f	do IY go through anything 
1:24:50	1:24:54	f	to the leave 
1:24:54	1:24:57	g	and that where the plane crash be 
1:25:35	1:25:38	f	ok 
1:26:3	1:26:8	g	and then 
1:26:19	1:26:28	g	uhm 
1:27:9	1:27:11	f	ok 
1:29:42	1:29:43	g	ok 
1:31:31	1:31:33	g	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
1:33:16	1:33:16	g	just a slight slope 
1:33:46	1:33:47	g	so IY at the hot spring 
1:34:16	1:34:25	f	ok 
1:34:30	1:34:35	f	IY at the savannah 
1:34:38	1:34:45	g	and then 
1:36:50	1:36:50	g	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
1:37:18	1:37:26	f	ok 
1:38:45	1:38:49	g	ok 
1:39:12	1:39:12	f	ok 
1:39:9	1:39:17	g	uhm IY straighten out slope 
1:42:49	1:42:57	g	like an inch 
1:43:17	1:43:23	f	yep 
1:44:14	1:44:16	g	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
1:48:32	1:48:34	g	around the bottom of it 
1:49:16	1:49:17	g	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
1:49:26	1:49:26	g	ok 
1:49:42	1:49:47	f	yeah and IY go straight up 
1:51:11	1:51:15	f	do IY go around it 
1:51:11	1:51:19	f	IY hit some rock though 
1:51:59	1:52:2	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
1:53:7	1:53:11	g	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
1:53:17	1:53:18	g	probably the same thing 
1:53:58	1:53:58	f	IY know IY have different thing so 
1:53:58	1:54:1	g	IY have a waterhole on map 
1:56:11	1:56:20	g	an inch maybe a little bit less 
1:56:20	1:56:29	g	ok 
1:56:26	1:56:33	f	nope 
1:56:42	1:56:42	f	ok 
1:56:45	1:56:50	g	ok 
1:56:55	1:57:0	g	IY kind of go 
2:0:36	2:0:44	f	IY hit some round rock 
2:1:59	2:2:4	f	ok 
2:2:50	2:2:56	f	ok 
2:5:15	2:5:16	g	and then IY slope up 
2:5:24	2:5:33	f	yeah 
2:6:13	2:6:20	g	to the lake 
2:6:44	2:6:52	g	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
2:6:58	2:7:7	f	so wait 
2:7:29	2:7:36	g	no IY don have a waterhole 
2:7:36	2:7:42	g	well 
2:9:51	2:9:53	g	ok 
2:10:20	2:10:25	g	uh like 
2:11:38	2:11:39	f	ok 
2:12:5	2:12:12	f	IY start yeah the stony desert 
2:12:38	2:12:47	g	ok and then IY go 
2:14:0	2:14:6	f	ok 
2:15:26	2:15:34	g	uhm 
2:16:6	2:16:9	g	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
2:16:28	2:16:33	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY just ok 
2:16:41	2:16:48	g	uhm 
2:16:58	2:17:7	f	ok 
2:17:50	2:17:58	g	then 
2:18:0	2:18:1	g	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
2:19:6	2:19:14	f	IY have to back up a little bit 
2:19:35	2:19:36	g	so anyway 
2:25:3	2:25:5	g	no IY have 
2:25:54	2:25:56	g	so IY make circle 
2:25:55	2:25:56	g	alright well IY keep go and see 
2:31:11	2:31:18	g	there a there 
2:31:19	2:31:24	g	like three inch 
2:33:49	2:33:52	g	and then 
2:34:49	2:34:52	g	couple mile or something 
2:37:23	2:37:23	f	ok 
2:37:14	2:37:23	f	IY go to a lake 
2:37:18	2:37:26	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
2:40:36	2:40:44	g	uhm and there be a stony desert 
2:41:10	2:41:14	g	uhm 
2:41:56	2:42:1	g	ok 
2:42:2	2:42:2	f	and 
2:46:4	2:46:12	f	to the right 
2:46:46	2:46:46	f	IY three inch above the savannah 
2:49:24	2:49:25	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
2:53:54	2:53:57	f	plane crash IY don think be yeah 
2:55:57	2:55:57	g	ok 
2:56:22	2:56:23	g	IY go about 
2:58:51	2:58:51	g	yes 
3:0:4	3:0:7	g	ok plane crash isn there 
3:0:42	3:0:48	g	it right next to it 
3:1:23	3:1:32	f	ok 
3:4:40	3:4:41	g	and then IY slope 
3:5:14	3:5:20	g	no IY don have any rock 
3:6:24	3:6:24	g	ok 
3:7:11	3:7:12	g	alright be IY start near the 
3:9:16	3:9:25	g	maybe four inch on the paper 
3:9:33	3:9:36	g	IY just kind of slope down 
3:10:4	3:10:13	g	have a s 
3:10:38	3:10:41	f	uh IY don know know what to say

3:12:9	3:12:13	g	and 
3:14:37	3:14:38	g	and then IY come to a savannah 
3:14:48	3:14:53	g	no 
3:14:59	3:15:6	g	and 
3:16:53	3:16:57	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
3:20:41	3:20:48	f	mm Hmm 
3:20:47	3:20:51	g	ok 
3:22:19	3:22:21	g	and then 
3:22:55	3:23:4	f	ok 
3:23:40	3:23:43	f	but that like five six inch from where IY be now 
3:25:6	3:25:9	g	to the leave 
3:25:25	3:25:30	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
3:25:38	3:25:44	g	and then 
3:27:8	3:27:16	f	ok 
3:27:18	3:27:26	g	and then IY go straight 
3:27:41	3:27:50	g	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
3:29:42	3:29:42	g	like 
3:30:3	3:30:4	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
3:34:40	3:34:48	g	and then IY go 
3:35:33	3:35:34	f	elephant 
3:35:57	3:36:5	g	where IY go down to a plane crash 
3:38:13	3:38:19	g	IY move to the leave 
3:39:5	3:39:6	g	and IY go straight up 
3:39:9	3:39:11	f	ok 
3:40:29	3:40:29	g	after the circle 
3:43:24	3:43:33	g	and then IY slope down to the leave 
3:45:12	3:45:19	f	no IY go with hot spring IY have 
3:45:13	3:45:22	f	mm Hmm 
3:49:21	3:49:23	g	after IY go straight again 
3:49:47	3:49:49	g	to right 
3:50:29	3:50:36	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
3:52:6	3:52:6	f	ok 
3:52:36	3:52:41	g	and IY just go straight up 
3:52:41	3:52:48	g	alright alright well just 
3:53:23	3:53:24	f	mm mm 
3:54:57	3:55:1	g	five

3:56:3	3:56:11	g	IY 
3:57:57	3:58:6	g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
3:58:8	3:58:15	g	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
3:59:10	3:59:12	g	uhm 
3:59:29	3:59:38	f	yeah 
4:1:0	4:1:7	g	yes IY go towards the lake 
4:1:42	4:1:42	g	and IY go 
4:2:27	4:2:34	g	uhm 
4:5:48	4:5:54	g	not right at the stony desert 
4:8:20	4:8:26	g	slight 
4:10:23	4:10:27	g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
4:10:28	4:10:31	f	it not like in the same place IY describe 
4:11:49	4:11:54	g	now IY at the collapse shelter 
4:11:54	4:12:0	g	ok 
4:12:2	4:12:6	g	what 
4:15:15	4:15:23	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
4:17:47	4:17:56	g	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
4:19:24	4:19:26	g	and IY slope to the leave 
4:20:12	4:20:19	g	like 
4:20:48	4:20:52	g	uhhh no 
4:21:47	4:21:49	g	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
4:21:58	4:22:7	f	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
4:26:45	4:26:46	g	so that about IY would say 
4:27:43	4:27:43	f	to 
4:27:45	4:27:48	g	IY slope down again 
4:28:30	4:28:39	g	IY just go down 
4:30:55	4:31:3	g	ok 
4:32:7	4:32:8	g	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
4:34:12	4:34:17	g	and 
4:35:55	4:35:59	g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
4:36:45	4:36:45	g	and then IY be 
4:38:33	4:38:33	f	ok 
4:38:34	4:38:39	g	and then IY you go up 
4:39:0	4:39:3	g	straight up 
4:39:52	4:39:52	f	mm Hmm 
4:40:32	4:40:37	g	ok 
4:40:57	4:40:59	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
4:42:40	4:42:47	g	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
4:43:17	4:43:18	f	yeah 
4:43:25	4:43:29	g	like IY slope 
4:44:44	4:44:50	f	oh 
4:46:53	4:47:0	g	for like 
4:47:17	4:47:18	g	plane crash 
4:47:13	4:47:19	g	kind of across from stony desert 
4:47:16	4:47:22	g	be IY anywere near there 
4:49:16	4:49:16	g	like 
4:49:47	4:49:50	g	uhm 
4:49:43	4:49:52	g	for like 
4:51:12	4:51:21	g	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
4:51:25	4:51:33	f	around the lake to the top 
4:53:30	4:53:32	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
4:53:37	4:53:39	g	that about five or six inch 
4:55:27	4:55:29	g	away about like four inch four or five inch 
4:57:11	4:57:20	g	so 
4:57:30	4:57:30	g	about like 
4:57:34	4:57:41	g	three inch straight across 
5:0:25	5:0:33	g	alright 
5:1:10	5:1:10	g	three inch 
5:2:2	5:2:8	g	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
5:2:9	5:2:16	f	and there a collapse shelter 
5:5:17	5:5:25	g	be IY in like 
5:5:55	5:6:3	g	ok 
5:6:43	5:6:44	g	from 
5:8:21	5:8:23	g	to the white mountain 
5:12:25	5:12:34	g	a little 
5:13:43	5:13:50	g	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
5:15:20	5:15:22	g	ok 
5:16:8	5:16:8	g	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
5:16:15	5:16:22	g	ok well 
5:17:8	5:17:12	g	to the leave 
5:18:18	5:18:26	g	do IY have roman bath 
5:19:12	5:19:14	g	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
5:19:45	5:19:52	g	so IY go three inch straight 
5:22:20	5:22:24	g	just do it like this ok 
5:25:16	5:25:20	f	and curve down to the leave 
5:25:28	5:25:37	f	ok 
5:25:50	5:25:57	g	IY go straight down 
5:28:30	5:28:39	g	be IY anywhere near there 
5:33:14	5:33:23	g	to the right 
5:34:5	5:34:13	g	three inch 
5:35:16	5:35:19	g	and then 
5:36:22	5:36:24	g	IY start at the stony desert 
5:36:51	5:36:53	g	go up like three three and a half inch 
5:39:5	5:39:11	g	to the leave 
5:39:19	5:39:27	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
5:41:28	5:41:28	g	ok 
5:42:58	5:43:1	g	uhm 
5:44:21	5:44:21	g	like 
5:44:51	5:44:54	f	ok 
5:45:32	5:45:35	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
5:49:23	5:49:30	g	IY go like 
5:49:42	5:49:50	f	uhm
