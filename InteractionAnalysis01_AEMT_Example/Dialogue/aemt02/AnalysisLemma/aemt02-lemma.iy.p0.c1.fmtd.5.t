start
start g
0	0:2:3	0:2:10	and slope be about an inch long 
1	0:2:23	0:2:23	like maybe an inch 
2	0:2:26	0:2:33	alright 
4	0:5:42	0:5:50	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
5	0:5:49	0:5:58	four or five inch to the leave 
6	0:6:22	0:6:31	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
10	0:13:26	0:13:26	and be to the leave 
11	0:13:27	0:13:31	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
12	0:18:43	0:18:47	and then 
13	0:21:2	0:21:6	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
14	0:22:17	0:22:26	ok 
15	0:24:7	0:24:14	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
17	0:26:59	0:27:5	and there a plane crash 
18	0:27:11	0:27:14	what 
20	0:27:35	0:27:38	ok 
21	0:27:46	0:27:48	after plane crash 
22	0:30:38	0:30:45	ok 
24	0:31:14	0:31:18	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
25	0:31:33	0:31:36	IY move to the leave 
26	0:35:3	0:35:4	be IY in like 
27	0:37:25	0:37:28	no IY have 
28	0:38:8	0:38:9	be the plane crash 
29	0:39:23	0:39:28	ok 
30	0:40:21	0:40:21	ok 
31	0:42:36	0:42:36	uh like 
33	0:44:51	0:44:59	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
37	0:50:27	0:50:27	like three inch 
38	0:50:55	0:51:4	maybe 
39	0:51:22	0:51:23	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
40	0:51:28	0:51:33	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
41	0:54:20	0:54:23	uhm 
42	0:54:40	0:54:42	yes IY go towards the lake 
43	0:57:26	0:57:26	and then IY slope down to the leave 
44	0:58:35	0:58:37	ok 
45	0:59:22	0:59:25	uhm 
46	1:0:10	1:0:17	to the white mountain 
48	1:0:41	1:0:46	have a s 
49	1:1:1	1:1:4	around the bottom of it 
52	1:2:5	1:2:7	ok and then IY go 
53	1:3:1	1:3:6	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
54	1:3:5	1:3:7	and then IY you go up 
56	1:5:54	1:6:0	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
57	1:6:31	1:6:32	IY at the plane crash 
58	1:7:6	1:7:13	so that about IY would say 
59	1:10:13	1:10:20	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
62	1:11:27	1:11:27	uhhh no 
63	1:11:57	1:11:59	just do it like this ok 
64	1:13:51	1:13:57	and it slope a little bit to the right 
66	1:15:2	1:15:8	and IY slope to the leave 
67	1:15:32	1:15:38	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
69	1:16:13	1:16:19	well 
70	1:16:32	1:16:35	ok 
71	1:17:42	1:17:50	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
72	1:18:11	1:18:17	that little slope 
73	1:18:38	1:18:46	so IY go three inch straight 
75	1:20:13	1:20:18	and IY should have a straight line there 
76	1:20:56	1:21:3	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
77	1:21:10	1:21:13	and 
79	1:22:27	1:22:29	that about five or six inch 
81	1:24:34	1:24:36	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
82	1:25:49	1:25:50	ok 
83	1:27:10	1:27:19	ok 
84	1:28:43	1:28:48	ok

88	1:31:35	1:31:43	five 
89	1:36:58	1:37:1	go up like three three and a half inch 
90	1:37:0	1:37:8	IY slope 
91	1:37:41	1:37:41	where IY go down to a plane crash 
92	1:37:43	1:37:52	ok 
97	1:44:13	1:44:22	uhm IY straighten out slope 
98	1:45:26	1:45:26	ok 
99	1:46:44	1:46:44	IY 
100	1:47:21	1:47:24	and then IY go 
102	1:49:13	1:49:16	and IY just go straight up 
103	1:50:9	1:50:14	ok 
104	1:52:24	1:52:26	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
105	1:52:51	1:52:51	uhm 
106	1:53:25	1:53:28	and then 
107	1:58:5	1:58:7	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
108	1:58:7	1:58:9	IY kind of go 
109	1:59:53	2:0:0	ok 
110	2:0:26	2:0:26	like 
111	2:3:17	2:3:17	yes 
112	2:3:40	2:3:44	ok 
114	2:4:23	2:4:23	be IY in like almost the top of the 
115	2:8:54	2:8:57	ok 
116	2:10:34	2:10:36	and then IY be 
117	2:12:39	2:12:40	so anyway

120	2:20:58	2:21:0	uhm 
121	2:21:33	2:21:37	ok plane crash isn there 
123	2:23:7	2:23:14	they there 
124	2:23:16	2:23:17	for like 
125	2:23:21	2:23:22	IY actually start like right 
126	2:25:8	2:25:10	then 
127	2:25:44	2:25:44	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight

132	2:34:21	2:34:28	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
134	2:37:38	2:37:46	be IY anywere near there 
135	2:39:43	2:39:45	and 
137	2:41:35	2:41:44	after the circle 
138	2:42:10	2:42:14	do IY have roman bath 
139	2:42:29	2:42:35	alright well IY keep go and see 
140	2:42:59	2:43:6	an inch maybe a little bit less

142	2:46:29	2:46:38	IY go straight down 
143	2:47:46	2:47:55	kind of across from stony desert 
144	2:50:0	2:50:5	right next to circle should be roman bath 
145	2:50:13	2:50:22	IY go about 
146	2:51:10	2:51:19	IY make 
147	2:54:11	2:54:12	ok

155	3:3:52	3:3:59	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
156	3:4:44	3:4:44	to the lake 
158	3:5:25	3:5:27	to the leave 
159	3:5:32	3:5:36	and 
160	3:5:35	3:5:36	couple inch IY slope down 
161	3:5:36	3:5:40	and then 
162	3:6:16	3:6:25	to the leave 
163	3:8:7	3:8:13	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
165	3:10:0	3:10:6	to the leave 
166	3:10:44	3:10:51	to the leave of little path where path should be 
167	3:13:45	3:13:46	away about like four inch four or five inch 
169	3:14:58	3:15:1	maybe an inch and a half two inch

174	3:23:57	3:24:3	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
175	3:24:42	3:24:50	IY start 
176	3:25:42	3:25:42	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
178	3:27:30	3:27:39	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
179	3:27:35	3:27:43	like IY slope 
180	3:28:29	3:28:30	so 
182	3:30:17	3:30:23	and

199	3:49:51	3:49:53	well just 
200	3:52:43	3:52:52	so IY make circle 
203	3:55:13	3:55:21	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
205	3:57:4	3:57:9	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
207	4:0:36	4:0:40	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
208	4:2:21	4:2:23	ok 
209	4:2:41	4:2:50	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
210	4:3:48	4:3:55	maybe four inch on the paper 
211	4:5:28	4:5:29	like 
212	4:5:55	4:5:58	maybe like 
213	4:6:1	4:6:4	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
214	4:6:41	4:6:41	uhm 
215	4:7:50	4:7:58	ok 
216	4:9:13	4:9:20	about like 
217	4:10:29	4:10:37	ok well 
219	4:11:18	4:11:18	IY have a waterhole on map 
223	4:13:7	4:13:12	and then 
224	4:15:4	4:15:7	now IY at the collapse shelter 
225	4:15:51	4:15:53	like an inch 
226	4:16:7	4:16:8	IY would say 
227	4:17:46	4:17:51	ok 
228	4:18:7	4:18:12	IY don know 
229	4:19:29	4:19:34	three inch

233	4:25:0	4:25:6	ok 
234	4:27:24	4:27:29	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
235	4:28:0	4:28:5	no IY don have any rock 
237	4:33:23	4:33:31	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
238	4:33:38	4:33:43	be IY 
239	4:33:46	4:33:46	the 
241	4:35:50	4:35:57	maybe IY have different thing 
242	4:36:6	4:36:15	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
243	4:36:27	4:36:29	uhm 
244	4:37:33	4:37:40	and IY go up like 
247	4:40:3	4:40:5	a quarter of an inch 
248	4:41:6	4:41:6	not right at the stony desert 
251	4:44:49	4:44:49	alright be IY start near the 
252	4:45:6	4:45:10	plane crash 
255	4:46:28	4:46:33	it not a big curve 
256	4:46:35	4:46:37	and then 
259	4:48:10	4:48:17	and that where the plane crash be 
261	4:50:4	4:50:5	like four or five inch to the leave 
262	4:50:30	4:50:33	and then IY slope up 
264	4:52:31	4:52:33	just a slight slope 
266	4:53:12	4:53:18	ok 
267	4:53:28	4:53:31	uhm

271	4:57:29	4:57:29	uhm 
273	4:59:56	5:0:5	the slate mountain be towards the right 
274	5:1:0	5:1:9	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
275	5:4:36	5:4:40	to the right 
276	5:4:31	5:4:40	uhm 
277	5:5:11	5:5:16	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
278	5:7:59	5:7:59	uhm 
279	5:10:3	5:10:9	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
282	5:12:27	5:12:32	IY slope down again 
285	5:15:7	5:15:7	IY start at the stony desert 
287	5:18:59	5:19:4	probably the same thing 
289	5:21:29	5:21:32	there a there 
290	5:23:36	5:23:45	alright alright well just 
291	5:23:54	5:23:56	uhm

299	5:36:54	5:36:54	a little bit too 
301	5:38:19	5:38:28	maybe like 
302	5:39:5	5:39:12	so IY at the hot spring 
303	5:40:2	5:40:3	no 
304	5:40:3	5:40:10	but 
305	5:43:40	5:43:45	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
307	5:46:52	5:46:58	for like 
308	5:47:1	5:47:10	IY just go down 
309	5:48:19	5:48:24	from 
311	5:50:8	5:50:14	it right next to it 
312	5:50:59	5:51:1	uhm 
313	5:51:8	5:51:11	uhm and there be a stony desert 
314	5:52:36	5:52:39	after IY slope down IY say 
315	5:52:54	5:53:2	ok IY at the savannah 
316	5:53:52	5:53:52	be IY anywhere near there 
317	5:54:39	5:54:40	couple mile or something 
318	5:56:19	5:56:28	and IY go 
319	5:56:22	5:56:30	well alright 
320	5:56:38	5:56:43	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
321	5:57:37	5:57:40	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
323	5:58:38	5:58:38	and then IY slope 
326	6:3:54	6:4:3	what 
327	6:4:6	6:4:14	IY just kind of slope down

339	6:19:47	6:19:48	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
342	6:25:1	6:25:3	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
start f
3	0:5:21	0:5:25	ok 
7	0:6:51	0:6:58	IY at the savannah 
8	0:10:40	0:10:45	ok 
9	0:11:8	0:11:8	mm Hmm 
16	0:24:51	0:24:53	so IY go to the leave of the antelope

61	1:11:13	1:11:19	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
65	1:14:5	1:14:8	IY plane crash IY be talk about earlier that up there 
68	1:16:2	1:16:6	to 
74	1:19:53	1:19:58	yeah 
78	1:21:57	1:22:2	plane crash IY don think be yeah 
80	1:23:20	1:23:27	IY have to back up a little bit 
86	1:29:13	1:29:18	to the leave of the antelope

93	1:39:48	1:39:53	ok 
94	1:43:19	1:43:28	nope IY have a white mountain 
95	1:44:3	1:44:7	mm Hmm 
96	1:44:9	1:44:11	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
101	1:48:54	1:48:54	yeah 
113	2:4:8	2:4:13	no IY go with hot spring IY have 
119	2:19:26	2:19:31	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
122	2:22:22	2:22:24	yeah IY see 
133	2:36:6	2:36:13	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash 
136	2:39:47	2:39:52	ok 
151	2:57:19	2:57:23	how many inch do IY think 
153	3:1:28	3:1:33	ok

310	5:48:57	5:49:1	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
322	5:58:14	5:58:16	do IY go by the plane crash 
324	6:0:53	6:0:56	yeah 
325	6:3:30	6:3:39	mm Hmm 
333	6:9:47	6:9:56	ok 
334	6:12:41	6:12:41	and there a collapse shelter 
340	6:21:4	6:21:12	ok 
341	6:22:33	6:22:40	ok 
start g
0	0:2:3	0:2:10	and slope be about an inch long 
1	0:2:23	0:2:23	like maybe an inch 
2	0:2:26	0:2:33	alright 
4	0:5:42	0:5:50	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
5	0:5:49	0:5:58	four or five inch to the leave 
6	0:6:22	0:6:31	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
10	0:13:26	0:13:26	and be to the leave 
11	0:13:27	0:13:31	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
12	0:18:43	0:18:47	and then 
13	0:21:2	0:21:6	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
14	0:22:17	0:22:26	ok 
15	0:24:7	0:24:14	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
17	0:26:59	0:27:5	and there a plane crash 
18	0:27:11	0:27:14	what 
20	0:27:35	0:27:38	ok 
21	0:27:46	0:27:48	after plane crash 
22	0:30:38	0:30:45	ok 
24	0:31:14	0:31:18	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
25	0:31:33	0:31:36	IY move to the leave 
26	0:35:3	0:35:4	be IY in like 
27	0:37:25	0:37:28	no IY have 
28	0:38:8	0:38:9	be the plane crash 
29	0:39:23	0:39:28	ok 
30	0:40:21	0:40:21	ok 
31	0:42:36	0:42:36	uh like 
33	0:44:51	0:44:59	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
37	0:50:27	0:50:27	like three inch 
38	0:50:55	0:51:4	maybe 
39	0:51:22	0:51:23	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
40	0:51:28	0:51:33	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
41	0:54:20	0:54:23	uhm 
42	0:54:40	0:54:42	yes IY go towards the lake 
43	0:57:26	0:57:26	and then IY slope down to the leave 
44	0:58:35	0:58:37	ok 
45	0:59:22	0:59:25	uhm 
46	1:0:10	1:0:17	to the white mountain 
48	1:0:41	1:0:46	have a s 
49	1:1:1	1:1:4	around the bottom of it 
52	1:2:5	1:2:7	ok and then IY go 
53	1:3:1	1:3:6	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
54	1:3:5	1:3:7	and then IY you go up 
56	1:5:54	1:6:0	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
57	1:6:31	1:6:32	IY at the plane crash 
58	1:7:6	1:7:13	so that about IY would say 
59	1:10:13	1:10:20	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
62	1:11:27	1:11:27	uhhh no 
63	1:11:57	1:11:59	just do it like this ok 
64	1:13:51	1:13:57	and it slope a little bit to the right 
66	1:15:2	1:15:8	and IY slope to the leave 
67	1:15:32	1:15:38	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
69	1:16:13	1:16:19	well 
70	1:16:32	1:16:35	ok 
71	1:17:42	1:17:50	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
72	1:18:11	1:18:17	that little slope 
73	1:18:38	1:18:46	so IY go three inch straight 
75	1:20:13	1:20:18	and IY should have a straight line there 
76	1:20:56	1:21:3	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
77	1:21:10	1:21:13	and 
79	1:22:27	1:22:29	that about five or six inch 
81	1:24:34	1:24:36	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
82	1:25:49	1:25:50	ok 
83	1:27:10	1:27:19	ok 
84	1:28:43	1:28:48	ok

89	1:36:58	1:37:1	go up like three three and a half inch 
90	1:37:0	1:37:8	IY slope 
91	1:37:41	1:37:41	where IY go down to a plane crash 
92	1:37:43	1:37:52	ok 
97	1:44:13	1:44:22	uhm IY straighten out slope 
98	1:45:26	1:45:26	ok 
99	1:46:44	1:46:44	IY 
100	1:47:21	1:47:24	and then IY go 
102	1:49:13	1:49:16	and IY just go straight up 
103	1:50:9	1:50:14	ok 
104	1:52:24	1:52:26	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
105	1:52:51	1:52:51	uhm 
106	1:53:25	1:53:28	and then 
107	1:58:5	1:58:7	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
108	1:58:7	1:58:9	IY kind of go 
109	1:59:53	2:0:0	ok 
110	2:0:26	2:0:26	like 
111	2:3:17	2:3:17	yes 
112	2:3:40	2:3:44	ok 
114	2:4:23	2:4:23	be IY in like almost the top of the 
115	2:8:54	2:8:57	ok 
116	2:10:34	2:10:36	and then IY be 
117	2:12:39	2:12:40	so anyway

120	2:20:58	2:21:0	uhm 
121	2:21:33	2:21:37	ok plane crash isn there 
123	2:23:7	2:23:14	they there 
124	2:23:16	2:23:17	for like 
125	2:23:21	2:23:22	IY actually start like right 
126	2:25:8	2:25:10	then 
127	2:25:44	2:25:44	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
128	2:25:57	2:26:0	alright 
129	2:30:54	2:31:0	and then 
130	2:32:27	2:32:29	ok

132	2:34:21	2:34:28	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
134	2:37:38	2:37:46	be IY anywere near there 
135	2:39:43	2:39:45	and 
137	2:41:35	2:41:44	after the circle 
138	2:42:10	2:42:14	do IY have roman bath 
139	2:42:29	2:42:35	alright well IY keep go and see 
140	2:42:59	2:43:6	an inch maybe a little bit less

142	2:46:29	2:46:38	IY go straight down 
143	2:47:46	2:47:55	kind of across from stony desert 
144	2:50:0	2:50:5	right next to circle should be roman bath 
145	2:50:13	2:50:22	IY go about 
146	2:51:10	2:51:19	IY make 
147	2:54:11	2:54:12	ok

152	3:1:21	3:1:29	and then 
154	3:3:12	3:3:19	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
155	3:3:52	3:3:59	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
156	3:4:44	3:4:44	to the lake 
158	3:5:25	3:5:27	to the leave 
159	3:5:32	3:5:36	and 
160	3:5:35	3:5:36	couple inch IY slope down 
161	3:5:36	3:5:40	and then 
162	3:6:16	3:6:25	to the leave 
163	3:8:7	3:8:13	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
165	3:10:0	3:10:6	to the leave 
166	3:10:44	3:10:51	to the leave of little path where path should be 
167	3:13:45	3:13:46	away about like four inch four or five inch 
169	3:14:58	3:15:1	maybe an inch and a half two inch

171	3:17:20	3:17:25	no 
172	3:18:52	3:18:55	and then IY go straight 
173	3:20:37	3:20:44	IY wanna kind of curve 
174	3:23:57	3:24:3	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
175	3:24:42	3:24:50	IY start 
176	3:25:42	3:25:42	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
178	3:27:30	3:27:39	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
179	3:27:35	3:27:43	like IY slope 
180	3:28:29	3:28:30	so 
182	3:30:17	3:30:23	and

199	3:49:51	3:49:53	well just 
200	3:52:43	3:52:52	so IY make circle 
203	3:55:13	3:55:21	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
205	3:57:4	3:57:9	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
207	4:0:36	4:0:40	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
208	4:2:21	4:2:23	ok 
209	4:2:41	4:2:50	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
210	4:3:48	4:3:55	maybe four inch on the paper 
211	4:5:28	4:5:29	like 
212	4:5:55	4:5:58	maybe like 
213	4:6:1	4:6:4	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
214	4:6:41	4:6:41	uhm 
215	4:7:50	4:7:58	ok 
216	4:9:13	4:9:20	about like 
217	4:10:29	4:10:37	ok well 
219	4:11:18	4:11:18	IY have a waterhole on map 
223	4:13:7	4:13:12	and then 
224	4:15:4	4:15:7	now IY at the collapse shelter 
225	4:15:51	4:15:53	like an inch 
226	4:16:7	4:16:8	IY would say 
227	4:17:46	4:17:51	ok 
228	4:18:7	4:18:12	IY don know 
229	4:19:29	4:19:34	three inch 
230	4:21:53	4:21:56	after IY go straight again 
233	4:25:0	4:25:6	ok 
234	4:27:24	4:27:29	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
235	4:28:0	4:28:5	no IY don have any rock 
237	4:33:23	4:33:31	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
238	4:33:38	4:33:43	be IY 
239	4:33:46	4:33:46	the 
241	4:35:50	4:35:57	maybe IY have different thing 
242	4:36:6	4:36:15	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
243	4:36:27	4:36:29	uhm 
244	4:37:33	4:37:40	and IY go up like 
247	4:40:3	4:40:5	a quarter of an inch 
248	4:41:6	4:41:6	not right at the stony desert 
251	4:44:49	4:44:49	alright be IY start near the 
252	4:45:6	4:45:10	plane crash 
255	4:46:28	4:46:33	it not a big curve 
256	4:46:35	4:46:37	and then 
259	4:48:10	4:48:17	and that where the plane crash be 
261	4:50:4	4:50:5	like four or five inch to the leave 
262	4:50:30	4:50:33	and then IY slope up 
264	4:52:31	4:52:33	just a slight slope 
266	4:53:12	4:53:18	ok 
267	4:53:28	4:53:31	uhm 
268	4:53:53	4:53:53	like

271	4:57:29	4:57:29	uhm 
273	4:59:56	5:0:5	the slate mountain be towards the right 
274	5:1:0	5:1:9	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
275	5:4:36	5:4:40	to the right 
276	5:4:31	5:4:40	uhm 
277	5:5:11	5:5:16	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
278	5:7:59	5:7:59	uhm 
279	5:10:3	5:10:9	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
282	5:12:27	5:12:32	IY slope down again 
285	5:15:7	5:15:7	IY start at the stony desert 
287	5:18:59	5:19:4	probably the same thing 
289	5:21:29	5:21:32	there a there 
290	5:23:36	5:23:45	alright alright well just 
291	5:23:54	5:23:56	uhm 
292	5:28:33	5:28:42	and then IY go down 
295	5:30:49	5:30:57	ok well 
297	5:33:12	5:33:14	and then IY come to a savannah 
298	5:33:20	5:33:23	no there no elephant 
299	5:36:54	5:36:54	a little bit too 
301	5:38:19	5:38:28	maybe like 
302	5:39:5	5:39:12	so IY at the hot spring 
303	5:40:2	5:40:3	no 
304	5:40:3	5:40:10	but 
305	5:43:40	5:43:45	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
307	5:46:52	5:46:58	for like 
308	5:47:1	5:47:10	IY just go down 
309	5:48:19	5:48:24	from 
311	5:50:8	5:50:14	it right next to it 
312	5:50:59	5:51:1	uhm 
313	5:51:8	5:51:11	uhm and there be a stony desert 
314	5:52:36	5:52:39	after IY slope down IY say 
315	5:52:54	5:53:2	ok IY at the savannah 
316	5:53:52	5:53:52	be IY anywhere near there 
317	5:54:39	5:54:40	couple mile or something 
318	5:56:19	5:56:28	and IY go 
319	5:56:22	5:56:30	well alright
