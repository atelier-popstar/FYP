start
start g
0	0:0:20	0:0:26	ok 
1	0:2:33	0:2:42	to the leave of little path where path should be 
2	0:3:57	0:4:2	like 
3	0:5:33	0:5:39	then 
4	0:7:28	0:7:29	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
6	0:8:34	0:8:41	no IY don have a waterhole 
7	0:9:12	0:9:13	be the plane crash 
9	0:14:38	0:14:47	ok 
10	0:15:31	0:15:35	and then 
11	0:17:21	0:17:30	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
12	0:17:54	0:17:57	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
13	0:18:48	0:18:55	it not a big curve 
14	0:19:33	0:19:35	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
16	0:22:42	0:22:51	to the leave 
17	0:23:3	0:23:10	like 
18	0:25:25	0:25:33	there a there 
19	0:25:28	0:25:37	and then 
20	0:25:54	0:25:56	and IY should have a straight line there 
21	0:25:56	0:26:1	uhm 
24	0:28:48	0:28:51	be IY in like 
25	0:28:54	0:29:0	IY just go down 
26	0:29:18	0:29:21	uhm 
27	0:31:4	0:31:8	around the bottom of it 
29	0:31:30	0:31:39	and that where the plane crash be 
30	0:33:49	0:33:55	and then 
32	0:36:45	0:36:47	away about like four inch four or five inch 
34	0:41:51	0:42:0	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
35	0:41:59	0:42:2	be IY in like almost the top of the 
36	0:42:4	0:42:9	for about two inch 
37	0:47:43	0:47:45	IY go straight down 
38	0:47:45	0:47:51	it right next to it 
39	0:48:27	0:48:31	couple mile or something 
40	0:48:36	0:48:43	alright well IY keep go and see 
41	0:48:39	0:48:47	after IY slope down IY say 
42	0:49:9	0:49:12	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
43	0:49:57	0:50:1	ok 
44	0:50:16	0:50:18	straight up 
45	0:51:28	0:51:30	on sheet anyway 
46	0:51:42	0:51:46	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
47	0:53:58	0:53:59	three inch 
48	0:54:21	0:54:25	what 
49	0:54:42	0:54:49	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
52	0:56:57	0:57:6	and then IY come to a savannah 
53	0:57:54	0:58:1	ok 
54	0:59:18	0:59:27	to the right 
55	0:59:50	0:59:52	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
56	1:6:58	1:7:0	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
57	1:7:53	1:7:56	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
59	1:10:49	1:10:50	no IY don have any rock 
60	1:12:34	1:12:38	to the white mountain 
61	1:13:1	1:13:9	ok and then IY go 
63	1:14:55	1:14:59	but 
64	1:17:57	1:18:6	so that about IY would say 
67	1:19:21	1:19:25	after IY go straight again 
68	1:23:13	1:23:18	ok 
69	1:23:16	1:23:19	ok 
72	1:27:33	1:27:42	uhm 
73	1:28:0	1:28:6	probably the same thing 
74	1:28:26	1:28:28	uhm 
75	1:28:37	1:28:43	and then IY slope up 
76	1:30:38	1:30:40	to the leave 
77	1:34:13	1:34:20	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
78	1:34:36	1:34:45	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
79	1:35:0	1:35:8	what 
80	1:35:18	1:35:23	that little slope 
81	1:36:13	1:36:15	maybe 
83	1:37:1	1:37:2	IY start 
85	1:38:26	1:38:31	yes 
86	1:40:9	1:40:10	IY at the plane crash 
88	1:43:37	1:43:46	plane crash 
89	1:44:18	1:44:21	an inch maybe a little bit less 
90	1:44:19	1:44:25	just do it like this ok 
91	1:47:44	1:47:46	uhm 
94	1:51:45	1:51:49	do IY have roman bath 
95	1:52:29	1:52:30	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
99	1:56:12	1:56:19	ok 
101	1:57:17	1:57:25	uhm 
102	1:57:48	1:57:52	right next to circle should be roman bath 
103	1:58:0	1:58:7	uhm 
105	2:1:48	2:1:57	and then 
106	2:2:52	2:2:55	three inch 
107	2:4:2	2:4:5	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
108	2:5:41	2:5:43	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
109	2:7:32	2:7:41	ok 
110	2:7:44	2:7:51	that about five or six inch 
111	2:11:45	2:11:51	uhm 
113	2:13:13	2:13:21	slight 
114	2:17:16	2:17:18	no there no elephant

118	2:20:15	2:20:20	IY get 
119	2:21:8	2:21:17	alright be IY start near the 
120	2:24:1	2:24:6	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
122	2:30:27	2:30:33	maybe like 
123	2:32:36	2:32:43	ok 
126	2:34:22	2:34:29	uhm 
127	2:35:50	2:35:57	like four or five inch to the leave 
128	2:36:59	2:37:6	ok IY at the savannah 
129	2:37:30	2:37:35	five 
131	2:40:26	2:40:31	ok 
132	2:41:19	2:41:22	uhm and there be a stony desert 
134	2:43:21	2:43:24	IY make 
135	2:43:28	2:43:31	ok 
136	2:45:40	2:45:43	kind of across from stony desert 
137	2:53:7	2:53:15	not right at the stony desert 
141	2:55:27	2:55:28	a quarter of an inch 
143	2:56:18	2:56:25	couple inch IY slope down 
144	2:56:35	2:56:39	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
145	2:56:52	2:57:1	and then IY slope 
146	2:59:18	2:59:20	well just 
147	2:59:24	2:59:32	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
148	3:1:6	3:1:11	like three inch 
149	3:2:46	3:2:49	IY wanna kind of curve 
150	3:3:10	3:3:16	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
152	3:4:24	3:4:28	ok 
153	3:7:9	3:7:18	be IY anywhere near there

158	3:13:30	3:13:35	IY go like 
160	3:14:28	3:14:32	now IY at the collapse shelter 
161	3:14:41	3:14:45	four or five inch to the leave 
162	3:15:12	3:15:15	IY 
164	3:17:25	3:17:29	to the lake 
165	3:18:8	3:18:8	after the circle 
166	3:18:13	3:18:21	so IY make circle 
167	3:19:12	3:19:20	ok well 
172	3:22:33	3:22:33	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
174	3:26:50	3:26:51	the

198	3:55:34	3:55:42	ok 
200	3:57:23	3:57:29	IY start at the stony desert 
201	3:58:26	3:58:29	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
202	3:58:37	3:58:40	alright 
204	4:0:34	4:0:36	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
206	4:2:34	4:2:36	a little 
207	4:3:7	4:3:7	like IY slope 
212	4:10:10	4:10:11	and then IY you go up 
213	4:10:53	4:11:1	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
214	4:11:25	4:11:29	and slope be about an inch long 
217	4:15:52	4:15:53	be IY 
218	4:16:20	4:16:25	no IY have 
219	4:16:25	4:16:30	IY go about 
221	4:17:38	4:17:39	well alright

223	4:18:51	4:18:55	no 
224	4:19:1	4:19:5	to right 
225	4:20:13	4:20:21	just a slight slope 
227	4:25:21	4:25:24	so IY go three inch straight 
228	4:26:40	4:26:45	IY just kind of slope down 
229	4:27:4	4:27:9	ok well 
230	4:32:1	4:32:2	uhm 
231	4:34:13	4:34:16	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
232	4:34:26	4:34:27	alright alright well just 
233	4:34:39	4:34:43	ok 
234	4:35:50	4:35:51	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
236	4:37:46	4:37:51	about like 
238	4:43:48	4:43:49	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
239	4:43:53	4:43:53	well 
241	4:44:53	4:44:56	and 
242	4:45:14	4:45:16	uhm IY straighten out slope 
243	4:45:27	4:45:27	and then IY be 
244	4:45:34	4:45:38	ok 
245	4:46:1	4:46:10	uhm

249	4:49:53	4:49:53	for like 
250	4:51:1	4:51:4	and be to the leave 
251	4:54:41	4:54:49	uhhh no 
253	4:56:13	4:56:15	Hmm 
254	4:56:11	4:56:16	and then

264	5:8:2	5:8:7	and then 
266	5:10:34	5:10:36	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
267	5:11:6	5:11:6	ok 
268	5:11:2	5:11:10	and 
269	5:11:25	5:11:31	so IY at the hot spring 
272	5:13:35	5:13:40	ok 
273	5:13:53	5:14:1	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
274	5:14:9	5:14:10	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
276	5:17:1	5:17:2	after plane crash 
277	5:17:24	5:17:30	the slate mountain be towards the right 
278	5:21:36	5:21:43	so 
279	5:21:57	5:22:0	and IY go straight up 
280	5:22:27	5:22:27	have a s 
282	5:26:10	5:26:15	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
283	5:28:12	5:28:21	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
284	5:28:55	5:29:4	ok plane crash isn there 
285	5:30:14	5:30:22	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
286	5:30:27	5:30:34	and IY go 
287	5:30:32	5:30:35	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
288	5:34:22	5:34:30	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
290	5:35:55	5:35:55	and then IY go down 
291	5:36:5	5:36:12	for like 
292	5:36:22	5:36:31	and 
293	5:38:39	5:38:41	yes IY go towards the lake 
294	5:39:4	5:39:4	uhm 
295	5:40:1	5:40:3	IY move to the leave 
296	5:39:56	5:40:4	and it slope a little bit to the right 
297	5:40:45	5:40:50	and then IY slope down to the leave 
298	5:40:52	5:40:58	where IY go down to a plane crash 
299	5:42:4	5:42:5	maybe four inch on the paper 
300	5:43:11	5:43:12	ok 
303	5:44:17	5:44:24	go up like three three and a half inch 
304	5:45:56	5:46:3	IY actually start like right 
305	5:46:29	5:46:33	and there a plane crash 
306	5:46:37	5:46:39	three inch straight across 
308	5:48:14	5:48:20	to the leave 
309	5:48:25	5:48:32	no 
310	5:51:5	5:51:10	IY don know 
311	5:52:11	5:52:13	like an inch 
312	5:53:42	5:53:49	and IY just go straight up 
315	5:56:32	5:56:35	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
317	5:58:53	5:59:1	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
319	5:59:19	5:59:23	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
320	6:1:19	6:1:19	and then 
321	6:1:23	6:1:23	they there 
322	6:2:29	6:2:30	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
323	6:2:41	6:2:50	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
325	6:3:47	6:3:47	and 
326	6:4:59	6:5:7	and IY go up like 
327	6:5:47	6:5:53	yes 
328	6:5:56	6:5:56	IY would say 
329	6:5:57	6:6:3	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
330	6:6:28	6:6:35	ok 
331	6:7:53	6:8:0	from 
332	6:9:19	6:9:22	uhm 
334	6:11:30	6:11:32	like maybe an inch 
336	6:12:27	6:12:27	and IY slope to the leave 
338	6:14:20	6:14:26	IY have a waterhole on map 
341	6:18:5	6:18:7	and then IY go 
342	6:19:22	6:19:31	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
start f
5	0:7:23	0:7:30	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
8	0:10:44	0:10:46	IY at the savannah 
15	0:21:45	0:21:49	IY hit some round rock 
22	0:26:13	0:26:14	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash 
23	0:28:0	0:28:3	ok 
28	0:31:31	0:31:36	ok 
31	0:33:57	0:33:58	ok 
33	0:40:35	0:40:37	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
50	0:56:18	0:56:27	ok 
51	0:56:30	0:56:32	and curve down to the leave 
58	1:9:2	1:9:4	yeah 
62	1:14:24	1:14:28	mm Hmm 
65	1:18:49	1:18:55	ok 
66	1:19:11	1:19:18	mm Hmm 
70	1:25:15	1:25:20	IY three inch above the savannah 
71	1:27:6	1:27:12	ok 
82	1:36:43	1:36:46	how many inch do IY think 
84	1:38:25	1:38:25	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
87	1:42:50	1:42:50	IY have to back up a little bit 
92	1:51:15	1:51:23	to the leave of the antelope 
93	1:51:25	1:51:33	mm Hmm 
96	1:54:1	1:54:5	yeah IY see 
97	1:54:23	1:54:28	around the top of the lake

170	3:21:57	3:21:57	plane crash IY don think be yeah 
171	3:22:5	3:22:10	elephant 
173	3:26:11	3:26:17	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
175	3:27:12	3:27:17	ok 
177	3:29:28	3:29:36	do IY go by the plane crash 
180	3:32:59	3:33:0	mm mm 
187	3:40:52	3:41:1	and to the right 
189	3:41:52	3:41:53	ok

215	4:13:2	4:13:6	and there a collapse shelter 
216	4:15:5	4:15:10	ok 
220	4:17:35	4:17:38	so wait 
226	4:22:54	4:22:55	and then what

270	5:12:38	5:12:38	but that like five six inch from where IY be now 
271	5:12:40	5:12:40	yeah 
275	5:15:8	5:15:10	around the lake to the top 
281	5:26:6	5:26:10	ok 
289	5:35:7	5:35:11	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
301	5:43:31	5:43:32	ok 
302	5:44:15	5:44:16	yeah 
307	5:46:49	5:46:55	ok

339	6:14:53	6:14:55	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
340	6:16:8	6:16:13	IY go to a lake 
start g
0	0:0:20	0:0:26	ok 
1	0:2:33	0:2:42	to the leave of little path where path should be 
2	0:3:57	0:4:2	like 
3	0:5:33	0:5:39	then 
4	0:7:28	0:7:29	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
6	0:8:34	0:8:41	no IY don have a waterhole 
7	0:9:12	0:9:13	be the plane crash 
9	0:14:38	0:14:47	ok 
10	0:15:31	0:15:35	and then 
11	0:17:21	0:17:30	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
12	0:17:54	0:17:57	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
13	0:18:48	0:18:55	it not a big curve 
14	0:19:33	0:19:35	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
16	0:22:42	0:22:51	to the leave 
17	0:23:3	0:23:10	like 
18	0:25:25	0:25:33	there a there 
19	0:25:28	0:25:37	and then 
20	0:25:54	0:25:56	and IY should have a straight line there 
21	0:25:56	0:26:1	uhm 
24	0:28:48	0:28:51	be IY in like 
25	0:28:54	0:29:0	IY just go down 
26	0:29:18	0:29:21	uhm 
27	0:31:4	0:31:8	around the bottom of it 
29	0:31:30	0:31:39	and that where the plane crash be 
30	0:33:49	0:33:55	and then 
32	0:36:45	0:36:47	away about like four inch four or five inch 
34	0:41:51	0:42:0	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
35	0:41:59	0:42:2	be IY in like almost the top of the 
36	0:42:4	0:42:9	for about two inch 
37	0:47:43	0:47:45	IY go straight down 
38	0:47:45	0:47:51	it right next to it 
39	0:48:27	0:48:31	couple mile or something 
40	0:48:36	0:48:43	alright well IY keep go and see 
41	0:48:39	0:48:47	after IY slope down IY say 
42	0:49:9	0:49:12	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
43	0:49:57	0:50:1	ok 
44	0:50:16	0:50:18	straight up 
45	0:51:28	0:51:30	on sheet anyway 
46	0:51:42	0:51:46	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
47	0:53:58	0:53:59	three inch 
48	0:54:21	0:54:25	what 
49	0:54:42	0:54:49	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
52	0:56:57	0:57:6	and then IY come to a savannah 
53	0:57:54	0:58:1	ok 
54	0:59:18	0:59:27	to the right 
55	0:59:50	0:59:52	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
56	1:6:58	1:7:0	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
57	1:7:53	1:7:56	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
59	1:10:49	1:10:50	no IY don have any rock 
60	1:12:34	1:12:38	to the white mountain 
61	1:13:1	1:13:9	ok and then IY go 
63	1:14:55	1:14:59	but 
64	1:17:57	1:18:6	so that about IY would say 
67	1:19:21	1:19:25	after IY go straight again

74	1:28:26	1:28:28	uhm 
75	1:28:37	1:28:43	and then IY slope up 
76	1:30:38	1:30:40	to the leave 
77	1:34:13	1:34:20	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
78	1:34:36	1:34:45	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
79	1:35:0	1:35:8	what 
80	1:35:18	1:35:23	that little slope 
81	1:36:13	1:36:15	maybe

85	1:38:26	1:38:31	yes 
86	1:40:9	1:40:10	IY at the plane crash 
88	1:43:37	1:43:46	plane crash 
89	1:44:18	1:44:21	an inch maybe a little bit less 
90	1:44:19	1:44:25	just do it like this ok 
91	1:47:44	1:47:46	uhm 
94	1:51:45	1:51:49	do IY have roman bath 
95	1:52:29	1:52:30	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
99	1:56:12	1:56:19	ok 
101	1:57:17	1:57:25	uhm 
102	1:57:48	1:57:52	right next to circle should be roman bath 
103	1:58:0	1:58:7	uhm 
105	2:1:48	2:1:57	and then 
106	2:2:52	2:2:55	three inch 
107	2:4:2	2:4:5	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
108	2:5:41	2:5:43	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
109	2:7:32	2:7:41	ok

119	2:21:8	2:21:17	alright be IY start near the 
120	2:24:1	2:24:6	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
122	2:30:27	2:30:33	maybe like 
123	2:32:36	2:32:43	ok 
126	2:34:22	2:34:29	uhm

160	3:14:28	3:14:32	now IY at the collapse shelter 
161	3:14:41	3:14:45	four or five inch to the leave 
162	3:15:12	3:15:15	IY 
164	3:17:25	3:17:29	to the lake 
165	3:18:8	3:18:8	after the circle 
166	3:18:13	3:18:21	so IY make circle 
167	3:19:12	3:19:20	ok well 
172	3:22:33	3:22:33	it like a slight little upwards to the right

212	4:10:10	4:10:11	and then IY you go up 
213	4:10:53	4:11:1	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
214	4:11:25	4:11:29	and slope be about an inch long 
217	4:15:52	4:15:53	be IY

236	4:37:46	4:37:51	about like 
238	4:43:48	4:43:49	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
239	4:43:53	4:43:53	well 
241	4:44:53	4:44:56	and 
242	4:45:14	4:45:16	uhm IY straighten out slope

266	5:10:34	5:10:36	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
267	5:11:6	5:11:6	ok 
268	5:11:2	5:11:10	and 
269	5:11:25	5:11:31	so IY at the hot spring 
272	5:13:35	5:13:40	ok 
273	5:13:53	5:14:1	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
274	5:14:9	5:14:10	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
276	5:17:1	5:17:2	after plane crash 
277	5:17:24	5:17:30	the slate mountain be towards the right 
278	5:21:36	5:21:43	so 
279	5:21:57	5:22:0	and IY go straight up 
280	5:22:27	5:22:27	have a s 
282	5:26:10	5:26:15	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
283	5:28:12	5:28:21	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
284	5:28:55	5:29:4	ok plane crash isn there 
285	5:30:14	5:30:22	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
286	5:30:27	5:30:34	and IY go 
287	5:30:32	5:30:35	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
288	5:34:22	5:34:30	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
290	5:35:55	5:35:55	and then IY go down 
291	5:36:5	5:36:12	for like 
292	5:36:22	5:36:31	and 
293	5:38:39	5:38:41	yes IY go towards the lake 
294	5:39:4	5:39:4	uhm 
295	5:40:1	5:40:3	IY move to the leave 
296	5:39:56	5:40:4	and it slope a little bit to the right 
297	5:40:45	5:40:50	and then IY slope down to the leave 
298	5:40:52	5:40:58	where IY go down to a plane crash 
299	5:42:4	5:42:5	maybe four inch on the paper 
300	5:43:11	5:43:12	ok 
303	5:44:17	5:44:24	go up like three three and a half inch 
304	5:45:56	5:46:3	IY actually start like right 
305	5:46:29	5:46:33	and there a plane crash 
306	5:46:37	5:46:39	three inch straight across 
308	5:48:14	5:48:20	to the leave 
309	5:48:25	5:48:32	no 
310	5:51:5	5:51:10	IY don know 
311	5:52:11	5:52:13	like an inch 
312	5:53:42	5:53:49	and IY just go straight up 
315	5:56:32	5:56:35	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
317	5:58:53	5:59:1	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
319	5:59:19	5:59:23	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
320	6:1:19	6:1:19	and then
