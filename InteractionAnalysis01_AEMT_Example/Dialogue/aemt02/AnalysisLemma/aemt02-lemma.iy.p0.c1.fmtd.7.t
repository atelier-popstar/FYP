start
start g
0	0:0:2	0:0:8	after the circle 
1	0:0:40	0:0:45	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
2	0:0:44	0:0:49	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
4	0:1:55	0:1:55	to the white mountain 
5	0:5:13	0:5:15	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
6	0:5:49	0:5:51	to the leave of little path where path should be 
8	0:6:32	0:6:33	ok IY at the savannah 
9	0:6:34	0:6:36	four or five inch to the leave 
10	0:9:56	0:9:59	ok 
11	0:10:11	0:10:11	uhm 
14	0:16:33	0:16:38	well 
17	0:19:27	0:19:32	like IY slope 
18	0:22:42	0:22:47	and then IY you go up 
19	0:23:11	0:23:12	and IY just go straight up 
20	0:24:19	0:24:19	and 
21	0:24:17	0:24:22	ok 
22	0:24:26	0:24:28	and then IY slope up 
23	0:24:20	0:24:29	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
25	0:26:32	0:26:32	straight up 
26	0:27:6	0:27:7	uh like 
27	0:27:42	0:27:47	ok 
28	0:28:21	0:28:26	alright well IY keep go and see 
29	0:29:38	0:29:40	alright 
30	0:31:17	0:31:23	right next to circle should be roman bath 
31	0:32:33	0:32:35	IY would say 
33	0:34:15	0:34:20	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
34	0:34:28	0:34:36	alright alright well just 
35	0:35:9	0:35:14	IY kind of go 
37	0:36:55	0:36:57	no IY have 
38	0:37:7	0:37:8	IY at the plane crash 
39	0:37:3	0:37:10	for like 
40	0:40:17	0:40:22	for about two inch 
42	0:42:19	0:42:27	so IY at the hot spring 
43	0:42:46	0:42:48	well just 
44	0:45:43	0:45:43	to the right 
45	0:46:5	0:46:5	ok 
46	0:49:12	0:49:21	after IY go straight again 
48	0:51:20	0:51:21	and IY slope to the leave 
50	0:52:48	0:52:49	so IY go three inch straight 
51	0:58:1	0:58:10	ok 
53	1:0:15	1:0:17	uhm 
54	1:2:12	1:2:14	but 
57	1:4:26	1:4:26	no 
58	1:4:42	1:4:42	and then IY go down 
59	1:5:30	1:5:39	do IY have roman bath 
60	1:5:59	1:6:3	so anyway 
61	1:5:58	1:6:3	and then IY be 
62	1:6:34	1:6:42	and IY go 
63	1:6:58	1:7:0	what 
66	1:13:6	1:13:8	a little 
69	1:14:56	1:15:5	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
71	1:15:21	1:15:27	and then IY slope 
73	1:23:26	1:23:34	and then 
74	1:23:41	1:23:48	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
77	1:27:45	1:27:50	IY don know 
80	1:31:4	1:31:5	and then IY go 
81	1:31:44	1:31:51	it right next to it 
82	1:32:5	1:32:14	uhm 
83	1:32:20	1:32:20	uhm IY straighten out slope 
84	1:32:43	1:32:43	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
85	1:32:49	1:32:50	IY just go down 
86	1:33:29	1:33:32	be IY in like 
88	1:36:58	1:37:2	to the leave 
90	1:39:0	1:39:3	uhm 
91	1:39:23	1:39:30	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
94	1:42:48	1:42:53	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
96	1:46:18	1:46:21	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
97	1:46:18	1:46:23	plane crash 
99	1:47:40	1:47:48	uhm 
100	1:47:44	1:47:48	around the bottom of it 
101	1:48:1	1:48:10	uhm 
105	1:49:42	1:49:50	three inch straight across 
107	1:55:32	1:55:41	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
108	1:56:3	1:56:5	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
109	1:58:7	1:58:7	like three inch 
111	2:0:8	2:0:11	IY 
112	2:0:26	2:0:29	and IY should have a straight line there 
113	2:0:31	2:0:38	they there 
114	2:3:43	2:3:48	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
115	2:5:12	2:5:15	what 
117	2:7:12	2:7:14	and IY go straight up 
119	2:8:54	2:9:0	on sheet anyway 
120	2:9:14	2:9:22	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
121	2:10:49	2:10:49	after plane crash 
122	2:12:8	2:12:8	IY make 
123	2:13:42	2:13:50	the 
127	2:15:42	2:15:46	for like 
130	2:16:57	2:17:5	no IY don have a waterhole 
131	2:17:29	2:17:36	like maybe an inch 
132	2:18:32	2:18:39	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
133	2:20:49	2:20:52	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
135	2:21:41	2:21:43	IY go straight down 
136	2:22:10	2:22:18	ok well 
137	2:23:11	2:23:12	about like 
138	2:23:58	2:24:1	and it slope a little bit to the right 
139	2:28:27	2:28:33	so that about IY would say 
141	2:29:40	2:29:44	couple inch IY slope down 
142	2:31:9	2:31:18	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
145	2:37:3	2:37:8	just do it like this ok 
149	2:39:23	2:39:29	it not a big curve 
150	2:40:34	2:40:41	and that where the plane crash be 
152	2:41:47	2:41:52	yes 
153	2:42:11	2:42:18	IY actually start like right 
154	2:43:29	2:43:29	then 
155	2:43:55	2:43:56	be IY anywhere near there 
156	2:43:51	2:43:57	IY have a waterhole on map 
157	2:44:38	2:44:41	uhm 
158	2:44:49	2:44:52	to right 
159	2:45:55	2:46:1	ok 
160	2:46:6	2:46:11	like 
161	2:46:21	2:46:28	and then IY slope down to the leave 
162	2:46:26	2:46:29	couple mile or something 
163	2:48:1	2:48:1	that about five or six inch 
164	2:48:36	2:48:39	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
166	2:50:50	2:50:55	to the leave 
167	2:51:42	2:51:43	no IY don have any rock 
168	2:52:25	2:52:29	and then IY come to a savannah 
170	2:54:23	2:54:24	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
171	2:54:38	2:54:40	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
172	2:54:40	2:54:47	ok plane crash isn there 
173	2:55:6	2:55:12	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
174	2:55:28	2:55:37	yes 
175	2:56:17	2:56:24	after IY slope down IY say 
177	2:57:16	2:57:22	and there a plane crash 
178	2:58:2	2:58:3	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
179	3:0:40	3:0:41	and IY go up like 
180	3:2:46	3:2:54	uhm 
181	3:3:52	3:3:58	maybe IY have different thing 
182	3:11:57	3:12:4	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
183	3:13:39	3:13:43	maybe like 
184	3:14:10	3:14:12	ok 
185	3:14:13	3:14:22	IY get 
186	3:21:44	3:21:48	and 
187	3:24:8	3:24:15	and slope be about an inch long 
188	3:25:9	3:25:14	the slate mountain be towards the right 
189	3:25:55	3:25:58	five 
191	3:29:3	3:29:12	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
192	3:35:56	3:36:5	alright be IY start near the 
193	3:39:49	3:39:58	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
197	3:46:7	3:46:7	so 
198	3:47:12	3:47:12	uhm 
200	3:49:43	3:49:47	and then 
201	3:50:32	3:50:41	uhm 
202	3:50:39	3:50:48	ok 
204	3:53:33	3:53:36	and then 
205	3:54:33	3:54:40	and be to the leave 
206	4:1:9	4:1:14	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
208	4:5:45	4:5:47	maybe four inch on the paper 
209	4:7:26	4:7:33	ok 
211	4:8:29	4:8:33	no 
213	4:8:59	4:9:5	three inch 
216	4:12:54	4:12:54	Hmm 
217	4:13:44	4:13:49	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
218	4:15:12	4:15:18	a little bit too 
219	4:15:39	4:15:40	yes IY go towards the lake 
220	4:16:26	4:16:30	and then 
221	4:16:26	4:16:32	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
222	4:17:20	4:17:25	uhm 
223	4:18:58	4:18:58	IY move to the leave 
224	4:21:18	4:21:25	ok 
225	4:23:0	4:23:1	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
226	4:25:7	4:25:11	IY just kind of slope down 
227	4:25:9	4:25:12	so IY make circle 
228	4:26:40	4:26:44	uhm 
229	4:27:52	4:28:0	well alright 
230	4:28:39	4:28:45	well 
231	4:28:53	4:29:1	ok

237	4:33:25	4:33:29	ok 
239	4:37:48	4:37:56	and 
240	4:38:11	4:38:16	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
241	4:38:30	4:38:37	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
242	4:39:22	4:39:31	be the plane crash 
243	4:39:30	4:39:37	probably the same thing 
244	4:40:24	4:40:32	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
245	4:42:2	4:42:9	ok 
247	4:43:33	4:43:38	go up like three three and a half inch 
248	4:44:40	4:44:48	IY go about 
249	4:44:52	4:44:52	have a s 
250	4:45:29	4:45:36	uhm and there be a stony desert 
251	4:46:0	4:46:9	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
253	4:48:33	4:48:35	like 
255	4:52:46	4:52:54	like 
260	5:0:56	5:0:57	a quarter of an inch 
261	5:1:19	5:1:26	ok and then IY go 
263	5:2:32	5:2:33	IY slope down again 
265	5:4:42	5:4:46	from 
267	5:7:41	5:7:46	and then 
269	5:8:28	5:8:30	uhhh no 
270	5:9:14	5:9:17	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
271	5:9:21	5:9:25	uhm 
272	5:9:50	5:9:54	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
273	5:12:1	5:12:4	maybe like 
274	5:15:32	5:15:37	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
276	5:19:50	5:19:56	and 
277	5:22:41	5:22:50	slight 
278	5:23:9	5:23:13	be IY 
280	5:25:17	5:25:21	where IY go down to a plane crash 
282	5:27:52	5:27:54	an inch maybe a little bit less 
283	5:28:38	5:28:45	and then 
284	5:29:35	5:29:42	and then IY go straight 
286	5:33:6	5:33:12	IY start 
287	5:33:54	5:33:59	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
288	5:35:23	5:35:27	and then 
289	5:35:45	5:35:52	no there no elephant 
290	5:36:34	5:36:41	IY go like 
291	5:37:25	5:37:28	be IY in like almost the top of the 
292	5:37:26	5:37:33	IY slope 
294	5:37:39	5:37:41	ok well 
296	5:39:33	5:39:38	ok 
297	5:40:26	5:40:31	that little slope 
298	5:42:16	5:42:18	ok 
299	5:42:13	5:42:19	ok 
300	5:42:39	5:42:47	alright 
301	5:43:0	5:43:0	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
302	5:43:5	5:43:10	uhm 
303	5:44:0	5:44:2	ok 
304	5:43:59	5:44:3	ok 
306	5:52:17	5:52:20	like an inch 
307	5:54:17	5:54:17	IY wanna kind of curve 
308	5:56:1	5:56:3	kind of across from stony desert 
309	5:56:29	5:56:30	to the lake 
310	5:57:14	5:57:14	away about like four inch four or five inch 
311	5:57:42	5:57:43	there a there 
312	5:58:31	5:58:34	like 
313	5:59:20	5:59:27	now IY at the collapse shelter 
314	6:0:2	6:0:9	uhm 
318	6:1:55	6:1:57	ok 
319	6:3:49	6:3:57	ok 
320	6:4:7	6:4:11	IY start at the stony desert 
321	6:4:25	6:4:32	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
322	6:4:58	6:5:7	ok 
323	6:8:41	6:8:44	three inch 
324	6:8:41	6:8:48	just a slight slope 
326	6:10:19	6:10:24	not right at the stony desert 
327	6:11:29	6:11:36	to the leave 
328	6:12:53	6:13:1	ok 
330	6:14:9	6:14:14	ok 
331	6:14:42	6:14:48	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
333	6:17:19	6:17:23	uhm 
334	6:17:23	6:17:25	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
335	6:17:43	6:17:43	and then 
336	6:18:36	6:18:45	be IY anywere near there 
337	6:18:48	6:18:55	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
338	6:20:50	6:20:55	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
341	6:24:0	6:24:6	like four or five inch to the leave 
342	6:24:19	6:24:21	ok 
start f
3	0:0:52	0:0:53	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
7	0:6:9	0:6:10	ok 
12	0:11:42	0:11:46	but that like five six inch from where IY be now 
13	0:13:32	0:13:33	IY hit some round rock 
15	0:18:26	0:18:34	IY plane crash IY be talk about earlier that up there 
16	0:19:11	0:19:16	ok 
24	0:25:48	0:25:49	yeah 
32	0:32:53	0:32:57	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
36	0:36:51	0:36:52	no IY go with hot spring IY have 
41	0:40:47	0:40:48	ok 
47	0:50:10	0:50:11	do IY go around it 
49	0:52:37	0:52:42	mm Hmm 
52	0:58:24	0:58:29	mm Hmm 
55	1:3:30	1:3:39	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
56	1:3:35	1:3:40	to 
64	1:7:18	1:7:24	around the top of the lake 
65	1:11:46	1:11:54	ok 
67	1:13:28	1:13:29	IY go to a lake 
68	1:13:31	1:13:38	ok 
70	1:15:14	1:15:18	ok 
72	1:16:40	1:16:48	ok

78	1:28:26	1:28:30	ok 
79	1:29:49	1:29:52	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
87	1:33:42	1:33:48	plane crash IY don think be yeah 
89	1:38:13	1:38:14	yeah and IY go straight up 
92	1:42:16	1:42:17	ok 
93	1:42:49	1:42:52	IY start yeah the stony desert 
95	1:45:9	1:45:9	IY hit some rock though 
98	1:46:16	1:46:23	up tp the right 
102	1:48:4	1:48:12	yeah 
103	1:48:36	1:48:39	yeah IY see 
104	1:49:22	1:49:29	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
106	1:54:27	1:54:33	ok 
110	1:58:22	1:58:23	ok 
116	2:6:21	2:6:22	yeah 
118	2:8:29	2:8:37	ok 
124	2:13:54	2:14:0	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash

190	3:27:53	3:27:53	it not like in the same place IY describe 
194	3:40:46	3:40:53	and curve down to the leave 
195	3:41:2	3:41:8	ok 
196	3:46:5	3:46:6	mm Hmm 
199	3:48:2	3:48:11	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
203	3:50:47	3:50:56	mm Hmm 
207	4:2:49	4:2:51	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
210	4:8:29	4:8:29	ok 
212	4:8:50	4:8:58	around the lake to the top 
214	4:11:43	4:11:52	so wait 
215	4:12:11	4:12:17	ok 
234	4:29:58	4:30:0	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
236	4:30:16	4:30:19	IY a plane crash though 
238	4:34:14	4:34:14	ok 
246	4:42:37	4:42:45	do IY go by the plane crash 
252	4:46:2	4:46:11	nope IY have a white mountain 
254	4:50:16	4:50:23	mm mm 
256	4:53:1	4:53:3	yeah 
257	4:58:50	4:58:55	plane crash be on the other side but IY just ok 
258	4:59:54	5:0:2	ok 
259	5:0:12	5:0:18	so IY go to the leave of the antelope

275	5:16:54	5:17:0	oh 
279	5:25:4	5:25:8	and there a collapse shelter 
281	5:27:22	5:27:22	to the right 
285	5:31:19	5:31:28	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
293	5:37:33	5:37:39	yep 
295	5:39:30	5:39:37	yeah 
305	5:44:2	5:44:5	ok

317	6:1:43	6:1:46	ok 
325	6:10:10	6:10:16	IY three inch above the savannah 
329	6:13:39	6:13:41	ok 
332	6:16:22	6:16:29	ok wait hold on 
339	6:21:18	6:21:21	mm Hmm 
340	6:22:24	6:22:31	and then what 
start g
0	0:0:2	0:0:8	after the circle 
1	0:0:40	0:0:45	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
2	0:0:44	0:0:49	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
4	0:1:55	0:1:55	to the white mountain 
5	0:5:13	0:5:15	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
6	0:5:49	0:5:51	to the leave of little path where path should be 
8	0:6:32	0:6:33	ok IY at the savannah 
9	0:6:34	0:6:36	four or five inch to the leave 
10	0:9:56	0:9:59	ok 
11	0:10:11	0:10:11	uhm 
14	0:16:33	0:16:38	well

18	0:22:42	0:22:47	and then IY you go up 
19	0:23:11	0:23:12	and IY just go straight up 
20	0:24:19	0:24:19	and 
21	0:24:17	0:24:22	ok 
22	0:24:26	0:24:28	and then IY slope up 
23	0:24:20	0:24:29	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
25	0:26:32	0:26:32	straight up 
26	0:27:6	0:27:7	uh like 
27	0:27:42	0:27:47	ok

29	0:29:38	0:29:40	alright 
30	0:31:17	0:31:23	right next to circle should be roman bath 
31	0:32:33	0:32:35	IY would say 
33	0:34:15	0:34:20	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
34	0:34:28	0:34:36	alright alright well just 
35	0:35:9	0:35:14	IY kind of go 
37	0:36:55	0:36:57	no IY have 
38	0:37:7	0:37:8	IY at the plane crash 
39	0:37:3	0:37:10	for like 
40	0:40:17	0:40:22	for about two inch 
42	0:42:19	0:42:27	so IY at the hot spring 
43	0:42:46	0:42:48	well just 
44	0:45:43	0:45:43	to the right 
45	0:46:5	0:46:5	ok 
46	0:49:12	0:49:21	after IY go straight again 
48	0:51:20	0:51:21	and IY slope to the leave 
50	0:52:48	0:52:49	so IY go three inch straight 
51	0:58:1	0:58:10	ok 
53	1:0:15	1:0:17	uhm 
54	1:2:12	1:2:14	but 
57	1:4:26	1:4:26	no 
58	1:4:42	1:4:42	and then IY go down 
59	1:5:30	1:5:39	do IY have roman bath 
60	1:5:59	1:6:3	so anyway 
61	1:5:58	1:6:3	and then IY be 
62	1:6:34	1:6:42	and IY go 
63	1:6:58	1:7:0	what 
66	1:13:6	1:13:8	a little 
69	1:14:56	1:15:5	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
71	1:15:21	1:15:27	and then IY slope 
73	1:23:26	1:23:34	and then 
74	1:23:41	1:23:48	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
77	1:27:45	1:27:50	IY don know 
80	1:31:4	1:31:5	and then IY go 
81	1:31:44	1:31:51	it right next to it 
82	1:32:5	1:32:14	uhm 
83	1:32:20	1:32:20	uhm IY straighten out slope 
84	1:32:43	1:32:43	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
85	1:32:49	1:32:50	IY just go down 
86	1:33:29	1:33:32	be IY in like 
88	1:36:58	1:37:2	to the leave 
90	1:39:0	1:39:3	uhm 
91	1:39:23	1:39:30	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
94	1:42:48	1:42:53	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
96	1:46:18	1:46:21	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
97	1:46:18	1:46:23	plane crash 
99	1:47:40	1:47:48	uhm 
100	1:47:44	1:47:48	around the bottom of it 
101	1:48:1	1:48:10	uhm 
105	1:49:42	1:49:50	three inch straight across 
107	1:55:32	1:55:41	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
108	1:56:3	1:56:5	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
109	1:58:7	1:58:7	like three inch 
111	2:0:8	2:0:11	IY 
112	2:0:26	2:0:29	and IY should have a straight line there 
113	2:0:31	2:0:38	they there 
114	2:3:43	2:3:48	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
115	2:5:12	2:5:15	what 
117	2:7:12	2:7:14	and IY go straight up 
119	2:8:54	2:9:0	on sheet anyway 
120	2:9:14	2:9:22	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
121	2:10:49	2:10:49	after plane crash 
122	2:12:8	2:12:8	IY make 
123	2:13:42	2:13:50	the 
127	2:15:42	2:15:46	for like 
130	2:16:57	2:17:5	no IY don have a waterhole 
131	2:17:29	2:17:36	like maybe an inch 
132	2:18:32	2:18:39	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
133	2:20:49	2:20:52	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
135	2:21:41	2:21:43	IY go straight down 
136	2:22:10	2:22:18	ok well 
137	2:23:11	2:23:12	about like 
138	2:23:58	2:24:1	and it slope a little bit to the right 
139	2:28:27	2:28:33	so that about IY would say 
141	2:29:40	2:29:44	couple inch IY slope down 
142	2:31:9	2:31:18	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
145	2:37:3	2:37:8	just do it like this ok 
149	2:39:23	2:39:29	it not a big curve 
150	2:40:34	2:40:41	and that where the plane crash be 
152	2:41:47	2:41:52	yes 
153	2:42:11	2:42:18	IY actually start like right 
154	2:43:29	2:43:29	then 
155	2:43:55	2:43:56	be IY anywhere near there 
156	2:43:51	2:43:57	IY have a waterhole on map 
157	2:44:38	2:44:41	uhm 
158	2:44:49	2:44:52	to right 
159	2:45:55	2:46:1	ok 
160	2:46:6	2:46:11	like 
161	2:46:21	2:46:28	and then IY slope down to the leave 
162	2:46:26	2:46:29	couple mile or something 
163	2:48:1	2:48:1	that about five or six inch 
164	2:48:36	2:48:39	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
166	2:50:50	2:50:55	to the leave 
167	2:51:42	2:51:43	no IY don have any rock 
168	2:52:25	2:52:29	and then IY come to a savannah 
170	2:54:23	2:54:24	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
171	2:54:38	2:54:40	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
172	2:54:40	2:54:47	ok plane crash isn there 
173	2:55:6	2:55:12	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
174	2:55:28	2:55:37	yes 
175	2:56:17	2:56:24	after IY slope down IY say 
177	2:57:16	2:57:22	and there a plane crash 
178	2:58:2	2:58:3	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
179	3:0:40	3:0:41	and IY go up like 
180	3:2:46	3:2:54	uhm 
181	3:3:52	3:3:58	maybe IY have different thing 
182	3:11:57	3:12:4	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
183	3:13:39	3:13:43	maybe like 
184	3:14:10	3:14:12	ok 
185	3:14:13	3:14:22	IY get 
186	3:21:44	3:21:48	and 
187	3:24:8	3:24:15	and slope be about an inch long 
188	3:25:9	3:25:14	the slate mountain be towards the right 
189	3:25:55	3:25:58	five 
191	3:29:3	3:29:12	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
192	3:35:56	3:36:5	alright be IY start near the 
193	3:39:49	3:39:58	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
197	3:46:7	3:46:7	so 
198	3:47:12	3:47:12	uhm 
200	3:49:43	3:49:47	and then

205	3:54:33	3:54:40	and be to the leave 
206	4:1:9	4:1:14	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
208	4:5:45	4:5:47	maybe four inch on the paper 
209	4:7:26	4:7:33	ok 
211	4:8:29	4:8:33	no 
213	4:8:59	4:9:5	three inch 
216	4:12:54	4:12:54	Hmm 
217	4:13:44	4:13:49	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
218	4:15:12	4:15:18	a little bit too 
219	4:15:39	4:15:40	yes IY go towards the lake 
220	4:16:26	4:16:30	and then 
221	4:16:26	4:16:32	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
222	4:17:20	4:17:25	uhm 
223	4:18:58	4:18:58	IY move to the leave 
224	4:21:18	4:21:25	ok

241	4:38:30	4:38:37	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
242	4:39:22	4:39:31	be the plane crash 
243	4:39:30	4:39:37	probably the same thing 
244	4:40:24	4:40:32	yes yeah IY just don even go near there

278	5:23:9	5:23:13	be IY 
280	5:25:17	5:25:21	where IY go down to a plane crash 
282	5:27:52	5:27:54	an inch maybe a little bit less 
283	5:28:38	5:28:45	and then 
284	5:29:35	5:29:42	and then IY go straight

291	5:37:25	5:37:28	be IY in like almost the top of the 
292	5:37:26	5:37:33	IY slope 
294	5:37:39	5:37:41	ok well 
296	5:39:33	5:39:38	ok 
297	5:40:26	5:40:31	that little slope

307	5:54:17	5:54:17	IY wanna kind of curve 
308	5:56:1	5:56:3	kind of across from stony desert 
309	5:56:29	5:56:30	to the lake 
310	5:57:14	5:57:14	away about like four inch four or five inch 
311	5:57:42	5:57:43	there a there 
312	5:58:31	5:58:34	like 
313	5:59:20	5:59:27	now IY at the collapse shelter 
314	6:0:2	6:0:9	uhm 
318	6:1:55	6:1:57	ok 
319	6:3:49	6:3:57	ok

321	6:4:25	6:4:32	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
322	6:4:58	6:5:7	ok
