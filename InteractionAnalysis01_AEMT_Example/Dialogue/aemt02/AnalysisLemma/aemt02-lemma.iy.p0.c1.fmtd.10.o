start
0:0:12	0:0:20	g	after plane crash 
0:1:26	0:1:31	g	to the leave 
0:1:47	0:1:54	g	and then 
0:1:56	0:2:1	f	and to the right 
0:2:26	0:2:28	g	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
0:3:2	0:3:2	f	uh IY don know know what to say 
0:4:19	0:4:24	g	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
0:5:12	0:5:15	f	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
0:5:47	0:5:52	g	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
0:8:55	0:8:58	f	mm Hmm 
0:8:58	0:9:0	g	after the circle 
0:10:20	0:10:29	f	to the leave of the antelope 
0:12:33	0:12:37	f	mm Hmm 
0:12:39	0:12:48	f	ok 
0:13:37	0:13:43	f	around the top of the lake 
0:13:52	0:14:1	g	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
0:16:49	0:16:57	g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
0:17:47	0:17:56	g	ok 
0:18:2	0:18:4	g	five 
0:18:18	0:18:22	g	a little bit too 
0:18:20	0:18:23	g	be IY in like almost the top of the 
0:18:25	0:18:28	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
0:18:47	0:18:52	g	ok 
0:22:56	0:23:4	g	couple mile or something 
0:24:32	0:24:35	g	IY have a waterhole on map 
0:24:50	0:24:52	g	and then 
0:24:55	0:25:2	g	kind of across from stony desert 
0:25:30	0:25:35	g	ok 
0:26:37	0:26:42	g	and IY just go straight up 
0:29:1	0:29:10	f	mm Hmm 
0:29:5	0:29:14	g	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
0:30:42	0:30:49	f	ok 
0:33:23	0:33:25	f	mm mm 
0:33:51	0:33:54	g	IY start 
0:35:36	0:35:36	g	ok 
0:36:34	0:36:36	g	and then 
0:36:51	0:36:53	f	ok 
0:37:28	0:37:32	g	alright well IY keep go and see 
0:38:1	0:38:2	g	three inch straight across 
0:38:50	0:38:50	g	ok 
0:38:52	0:39:0	g	maybe like 
0:41:34	0:41:40	g	IY make 
0:42:51	0:42:59	g	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
0:43:28	0:43:31	f	ok 
0:45:47	0:45:50	g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
0:46:57	0:47:0	g	and then IY go down 
0:48:26	0:48:31	g	uhm 
0:48:50	0:48:55	f	no IY go with hot spring IY have 
0:50:29	0:50:33	f	IY a plane crash though 
0:51:53	0:51:53	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
0:52:9	0:52:10	g	what 
0:53:20	0:53:25	g	and then 
0:53:38	0:53:46	g	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
0:54:47	0:54:52	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
0:55:22	0:55:31	g	where IY go down to a plane crash 
0:56:55	0:57:0	g	and then IY go 
0:57:20	0:57:26	g	so IY make circle 
0:57:34	0:57:40	f	and curve down to the leave 
0:58:26	0:58:30	g	ok plane crash isn there 
0:59:5	0:59:13	g	uhm 
1:0:56	1:0:57	g	for like 
1:1:15	1:1:24	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
1:1:42	1:1:49	g	well just 
1:2:35	1:2:40	g	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
1:4:26	1:4:26	g	like four or five inch to the leave 
1:6:2	1:6:5	g	uhm 
1:7:52	1:7:59	f	ok 
1:8:37	1:8:44	g	the slate mountain be towards the right 
1:9:31	1:9:40	g	IY get 
1:10:27	1:10:34	f	mm Hmm 
1:10:47	1:10:54	f	it not like in the same place IY describe 
1:10:53	1:10:54	f	ok 
1:12:2	1:12:3	g	be IY in like 
1:15:16	1:15:25	f	ok 
1:16:24	1:16:31	g	and then IY be 
1:20:2	1:20:10	g	away about like four inch four or five inch 
1:20:15	1:20:17	g	like 
1:21:51	1:21:53	f	ok 
1:23:34	1:23:39	f	ok 
1:25:30	1:25:37	g	and IY go up like 
1:26:41	1:26:43	g	and that where the plane crash be 
1:28:15	1:28:23	g	on sheet anyway 
1:28:36	1:28:40	g	no there no elephant 
1:29:47	1:29:48	g	four or five inch to the leave 
1:33:42	1:33:51	g	uhm 
1:37:44	1:37:45	g	ok 
1:37:54	1:37:58	g	uhm 
1:40:27	1:40:33	g	uhm 
1:43:16	1:43:17	g	a little 
1:43:21	1:43:29	g	and then 
1:43:54	1:44:3	f	and there a collapse shelter 
1:45:11	1:45:19	f	do IY go through anything 
1:46:14	1:46:21	g	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
1:47:14	1:47:20	f	ok 
1:47:24	1:47:27	g	slight 
1:48:24	1:48:24	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
1:48:25	1:48:33	g	and then IY slope down to the leave 
1:49:0	1:49:8	g	three inch 
1:49:13	1:49:19	g	Hmm 
1:51:11	1:51:16	g	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
1:53:3	1:53:6	g	the 
1:54:6	1:54:7	f	ok 
1:55:55	1:55:55	g	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
1:57:57	1:58:5	g	so IY go three inch straight 
2:0:14	2:0:19	g	have a s 
2:0:17	2:0:22	f	IY start yeah the stony desert 
2:0:32	2:0:33	g	it not a big curve 
2:1:10	2:1:17	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
2:2:49	2:2:52	g	there a there 
2:2:58	2:3:0	f	mm Hmm 
2:3:15	2:3:16	g	uhm 
2:6:40	2:6:42	f	how many inch do IY think 
2:8:19	2:8:27	g	ok and then IY go 
2:9:2	2:9:6	g	alright 
2:10:8	2:10:14	g	IY slope 
2:10:8	2:10:17	g	and then 
2:11:31	2:11:32	g	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
2:13:7	2:13:9	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
2:14:46	2:14:49	g	couple inch IY slope down 
2:15:11	2:15:18	f	yeah 
2:17:37	2:17:41	g	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
2:17:57	2:18:4	g	straight up 
2:18:28	2:18:33	g	then 
2:20:26	2:20:29	g	ok 
2:21:0	2:21:7	g	and then IY slope up 
2:21:24	2:21:28	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
2:21:34	2:21:43	f	ok 
2:21:55	2:21:57	g	and then IY slope 
2:21:55	2:22:3	g	and IY go 
2:22:29	2:22:34	g	so 
2:22:55	2:23:2	g	like maybe an inch 
2:24:33	2:24:35	g	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
2:26:49	2:26:49	g	IY would say 
2:26:57	2:27:0	f	ok 
2:27:15	2:27:24	g	ok 
2:27:18	2:27:25	g	alright 
2:27:29	2:27:33	g	that about five or six inch 
2:27:33	2:27:39	g	ok 
2:28:25	2:28:25	g	from 
2:28:31	2:28:35	g	uhm 
2:29:36	2:29:41	f	yeah

2:30:46	2:30:53	g	ok 
2:31:2	2:31:9	g	ok 
2:31:42	2:31:43	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
2:35:59	2:36:7	g	and IY slope to the leave 
2:37:4	2:37:9	g	IY just go down 
2:38:42	2:38:48	g	ok 
2:40:19	2:40:24	f	ok 
2:40:25	2:40:27	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
2:40:33	2:40:35	g	and then IY come to a savannah 
2:42:3	2:42:12	f	ok 
2:45:20	2:45:26	g	to the white mountain 
2:46:50	2:46:58	g	ok 
2:46:54	2:47:2	g	uhm 
2:47:22	2:47:29	f	ok 
2:50:42	2:50:45	g	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
2:51:33	2:51:37	f	ok 
2:52:39	2:52:39	g	uhm 
2:52:32	2:52:40	g	be IY anywere near there 
2:53:17	2:53:22	g	it right next to it 
2:53:55	2:54:3	g	for like 
2:55:53	2:55:55	g	do IY have roman bath 
2:55:56	2:56:4	f	oh 
2:57:15	2:57:20	f	IY know IY have different thing so 
2:57:17	2:57:21	g	like 
2:59:53	2:59:57	f	mm Hmm 
3:1:25	3:1:28	g	IY just kind of slope down 
3:1:29	3:1:30	f	to 
3:2:21	3:2:24	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
3:3:16	3:3:24	g	IY 
3:3:49	3:3:53	f	yeah 
3:4:0	3:4:9	g	uhm 
3:5:35	3:5:35	g	ok well 
3:6:29	3:6:37	g	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
3:6:55	3:6:55	g	yes 
3:7:19	3:7:26	f	ok 
3:10:25	3:10:25	g	IY actually start like right 
3:10:27	3:10:36	g	go up like three three and a half inch 
3:10:45	3:10:48	f	to the leave 
3:11:32	3:11:40	g	maybe four inch on the paper 
3:16:7	3:16:10	g	yes 
3:16:26	3:16:35	g	ok 
3:16:48	3:16:50	g	IY wanna kind of curve 
3:18:49	3:18:49	g	ok 
3:19:31	3:19:31	g	ok 
3:20:18	3:20:20	f	ok 
3:20:35	3:20:40	f	IY have to back up a little bit 
3:21:39	3:21:40	g	and then IY you go up 
3:21:39	3:21:48	g	IY at the plane crash 
3:22:34	3:22:38	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
3:22:55	3:22:55	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
3:23:40	3:23:42	g	plane crash 
3:24:41	3:24:48	f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
3:25:11	3:25:18	g	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
3:27:47	3:27:52	f	plane crash IY don think be yeah 
3:28:31	3:28:34	g	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
3:28:54	3:28:59	g	like IY slope 
3:30:37	3:30:38	f	elephant 
3:30:59	3:31:7	g	no IY have 
3:32:12	3:32:18	g	and then 
3:33:57	3:34:4	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
3:34:30	3:34:30	g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
3:34:47	3:34:50	f	and then what 
3:35:43	3:35:46	g	uhm 
3:36:42	3:36:46	g	and 
3:37:56	3:37:56	g	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
3:39:38	3:39:45	g	be the plane crash 
3:39:57	3:40:4	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
3:41:28	3:41:35	g	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
3:43:2	3:43:5	f	ok 
3:45:34	3:45:43	f	to the right 
3:45:44	3:45:53	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
3:48:12	3:48:19	g	to right 
3:52:46	3:52:51	g	and 
3:56:37	3:56:45	g	like 
3:57:0	3:57:4	g	ok 
3:57:24	3:57:25	g	and there a plane crash 
3:58:4	3:58:7	g	around the bottom of it 
3:59:6	3:59:15	g	no 
4:0:1	4:0:10	f	ok 
4:1:1	4:1:4	g	and 
4:3:28	4:3:36	g	yes IY go towards the lake 
4:4:26	4:4:33	g	no 
4:6:28	4:6:28	g	and IY go straight up 
4:6:29	4:6:31	f	ok wait hold on 
4:8:5	4:8:10	g	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
4:10:39	4:10:42	g	uhm IY straighten out slope 
4:11:42	4:11:50	g	what 
4:13:0	4:13:2	f	yeah 
4:14:19	4:14:21	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
4:14:49	4:14:53	g	ok 
4:16:44	4:16:48	f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
4:17:40	4:17:40	g	and 
4:19:44	4:19:51	g	ok 
4:20:7	4:20:8	g	be IY 
4:20:22	4:20:27	g	uhm

4:23:6	4:23:8	f	ok 
4:23:12	4:23:20	g	like three inch 
4:25:3	4:25:11	g	to the right 
4:25:36	4:25:37	g	IY go about 
4:26:39	4:26:44	g	ok IY at the savannah 
4:27:17	4:27:20	g	probably the same thing 
4:27:22	4:27:28	g	ok 
4:27:35	4:27:43	g	a quarter of an inch 
4:28:2	4:28:9	g	ok 
4:29:14	4:29:20	g	that little slope 
4:30:30	4:30:33	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
4:32:12	4:32:20	g	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
4:33:17	4:33:17	g	uh like 
4:34:1	4:34:1	f	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash 
4:35:2	4:35:8	g	alright be IY start near the 
4:35:31	4:35:35	g	well alright 
4:35:31	4:35:38	g	and then 
4:35:45	4:35:50	g	IY kind of go 
4:38:19	4:38:22	g	and slope be about an inch long 
4:39:57	4:40:6	g	so IY at the hot spring 
4:40:58	4:40:58	g	well 
4:42:32	4:42:35	g	IY start at the stony desert 
4:44:7	4:44:14	g	but 
4:47:1	4:47:7	f	IY go to a lake 
4:47:0	4:47:7	f	ok 
4:47:27	4:47:28	f	up tp the right 
4:48:36	4:48:45	g	not right at the stony desert 
4:48:51	4:49:0	f	nope 
4:50:47	4:50:52	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
4:52:17	4:52:20	g	so that about IY would say 
4:56:9	4:56:16	g	ok 
4:57:7	4:57:12	g	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
4:57:40	4:57:41	g	alright alright well just 
4:58:36	4:58:38	g	maybe like 
4:58:40	4:58:44	f	around the lake to the top 
4:58:53	4:59:1	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
5:2:38	5:2:43	f	yeah 
5:3:37	5:3:37	f	yep 
5:3:41	5:3:48	g	so anyway 
5:4:8	5:4:16	g	they there 
5:4:34	5:4:34	g	for about two inch 
5:6:11	5:6:20	g	ok 
5:7:16	5:7:17	g	maybe 
5:8:19	5:8:20	f	IY three inch above the savannah 
5:8:37	5:8:46	g	now IY at the collapse shelter 
5:14:10	5:14:10	f	do IY go around it 
5:15:16	5:15:25	g	three inch 
5:17:24	5:17:33	g	IY slope down again 
5:19:8	5:19:13	g	and then IY go straight 
5:20:54	5:20:57	f	IY hit some rock though 
5:22:46	5:22:51	g	ok 
5:23:8	5:23:8	f	IY at the savannah 
5:24:55	5:25:0	g	uhm 
5:25:30	5:25:39	g	IY move to the leave 
5:25:38	5:25:45	g	no IY don have any rock 
5:27:15	5:27:22	g	be IY anywhere near there 
5:27:32	5:27:35	f	yeah and IY go straight up 
5:32:59	5:33:7	g	like an inch 
5:34:0	5:34:1	g	and be to the leave 
5:34:4	5:34:4	f	and 
5:36:19	5:36:28	g	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
5:38:9	5:38:13	f	uhm 
5:41:50	5:41:50	g	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
5:42:1	5:42:3	g	IY go like 
5:42:11	5:42:20	g	after IY go straight again 
5:42:19	5:42:26	g	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
5:43:45	5:43:54	f	ok 
5:46:5	5:46:12	g	yes yeah IY just don even go near there
