start g
0	0:0:12	0:0:20	after plane crash 
1	0:1:26	0:1:31	to the leave 
2	0:1:47	0:1:54	and then 
4	0:2:26	0:2:28	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
6	0:4:19	0:4:24	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
8	0:5:47	0:5:52	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
10	0:8:58	0:9:0	after the circle 
15	0:13:52	0:14:1	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
16	0:16:49	0:16:57	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
17	0:17:47	0:17:56	ok 
18	0:18:2	0:18:4	five 
19	0:18:18	0:18:22	a little bit too 
20	0:18:20	0:18:23	be IY in like almost the top of the 
21	0:18:25	0:18:28	and IY should have a straight line there 
22	0:18:47	0:18:52	ok 
23	0:22:56	0:23:4	couple mile or something 
24	0:24:32	0:24:35	IY have a waterhole on map 
25	0:24:50	0:24:52	and then 
26	0:24:55	0:25:2	kind of across from stony desert 
27	0:25:30	0:25:35	ok 
28	0:26:37	0:26:42	and IY just go straight up 
30	0:29:5	0:29:14	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
33	0:33:51	0:33:54	IY start 
34	0:35:36	0:35:36	ok 
35	0:36:34	0:36:36	and then 
37	0:37:28	0:37:32	alright well IY keep go and see 
38	0:38:1	0:38:2	three inch straight across 
39	0:38:50	0:38:50	ok 
40	0:38:52	0:39:0	maybe like 
41	0:41:34	0:41:40	IY make 
42	0:42:51	0:42:59	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
44	0:45:47	0:45:50	and it slope a little bit to the right 
45	0:46:57	0:47:0	and then IY go down 
46	0:48:26	0:48:31	uhm 
49	0:51:53	0:51:53	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
50	0:52:9	0:52:10	what 
51	0:53:20	0:53:25	and then 
52	0:53:38	0:53:46	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
53	0:54:47	0:54:52	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
54	0:55:22	0:55:31	where IY go down to a plane crash 
55	0:56:55	0:57:0	and then IY go 
56	0:57:20	0:57:26	so IY make circle 
58	0:58:26	0:58:30	ok plane crash isn there 
59	0:59:5	0:59:13	uhm 
60	1:0:56	1:0:57	for like 
61	1:1:15	1:1:24	right next to circle should be roman bath 
62	1:1:42	1:1:49	well just 
63	1:2:35	1:2:40	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
64	1:4:26	1:4:26	like four or five inch to the leave 
65	1:6:2	1:6:5	uhm 
67	1:8:37	1:8:44	the slate mountain be towards the right 
68	1:9:31	1:9:40	IY get 
72	1:12:2	1:12:3	be IY in like 
74	1:16:24	1:16:31	and then IY be 
75	1:20:2	1:20:10	away about like four inch four or five inch 
76	1:20:15	1:20:17	like 
79	1:25:30	1:25:37	and IY go up like 
80	1:26:41	1:26:43	and that where the plane crash be 
81	1:28:15	1:28:23	on sheet anyway 
82	1:28:36	1:28:40	no there no elephant 
83	1:29:47	1:29:48	four or five inch to the leave 
84	1:33:42	1:33:51	uhm 
85	1:37:44	1:37:45	ok 
86	1:37:54	1:37:58	uhm 
87	1:40:27	1:40:33	uhm 
88	1:43:16	1:43:17	a little 
89	1:43:21	1:43:29	and then 
92	1:46:14	1:46:21	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
94	1:47:24	1:47:27	slight 
95	1:48:24	1:48:24	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
96	1:48:25	1:48:33	and then IY slope down to the leave 
97	1:49:0	1:49:8	three inch 
98	1:49:13	1:49:19	Hmm 
99	1:51:11	1:51:16	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
100	1:53:3	1:53:6	the 
102	1:55:55	1:55:55	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
103	1:57:57	1:58:5	so IY go three inch straight 
104	2:0:14	2:0:19	have a s 
106	2:0:32	2:0:33	it not a big curve 
107	2:1:10	2:1:17	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
108	2:2:49	2:2:52	there a there 
110	2:3:15	2:3:16	uhm

113	2:9:2	2:9:6	alright 
114	2:10:8	2:10:14	IY slope 
115	2:10:8	2:10:17	and then 
116	2:11:31	2:11:32	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
118	2:14:46	2:14:49	couple inch IY slope down 
120	2:17:37	2:17:41	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
121	2:17:57	2:18:4	straight up 
122	2:18:28	2:18:33	then 
123	2:20:26	2:20:29	ok 
124	2:21:0	2:21:7	and then IY slope up 
127	2:21:55	2:21:57	and then IY slope 
128	2:21:55	2:22:3	and IY go 
129	2:22:29	2:22:34	so 
130	2:22:55	2:23:2	like maybe an inch 
131	2:24:33	2:24:35	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
132	2:26:49	2:26:49	IY would say 
134	2:27:15	2:27:24	ok 
135	2:27:18	2:27:25	alright

143	2:31:2	2:31:9	ok 
144	2:31:42	2:31:43	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
145	2:35:59	2:36:7	and IY slope to the leave 
146	2:37:4	2:37:9	IY just go down 
147	2:38:42	2:38:48	ok 
149	2:40:25	2:40:27	to the leave of little path where path should be 
150	2:40:33	2:40:35	and then IY come to a savannah 
152	2:45:20	2:45:26	to the white mountain 
153	2:46:50	2:46:58	ok 
154	2:46:54	2:47:2	uhm 
156	2:50:42	2:50:45	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
158	2:52:39	2:52:39	uhm 
159	2:52:32	2:52:40	be IY anywere near there 
160	2:53:17	2:53:22	it right next to it 
161	2:53:55	2:54:3	for like 
162	2:55:53	2:55:55	do IY have roman bath 
165	2:57:17	2:57:21	like 
167	3:1:25	3:1:28	IY just kind of slope down 
170	3:3:16	3:3:24	IY 
172	3:4:0	3:4:9	uhm 
173	3:5:35	3:5:35	ok well 
174	3:6:29	3:6:37	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
175	3:6:55	3:6:55	yes 
177	3:10:25	3:10:25	IY actually start like right 
178	3:10:27	3:10:36	go up like three three and a half inch 
180	3:11:32	3:11:40	maybe four inch on the paper 
181	3:16:7	3:16:10	yes 
182	3:16:26	3:16:35	ok 
183	3:16:48	3:16:50	IY wanna kind of curve

185	3:19:31	3:19:31	ok 
188	3:21:39	3:21:40	and then IY you go up 
189	3:21:39	3:21:48	IY at the plane crash 
192	3:23:40	3:23:42	plane crash 
194	3:25:11	3:25:18	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
196	3:28:31	3:28:34	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
197	3:28:54	3:28:59	like IY slope 
199	3:30:59	3:31:7	no IY have 
200	3:32:12	3:32:18	and then 
201	3:33:57	3:34:4	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
202	3:34:30	3:34:30	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
204	3:35:43	3:35:46	uhm 
205	3:36:42	3:36:46	and 
206	3:37:56	3:37:56	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
207	3:39:38	3:39:45	be the plane crash 
208	3:39:57	3:40:4	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
209	3:41:28	3:41:35	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
213	3:48:12	3:48:19	to right 
214	3:52:46	3:52:51	and 
215	3:56:37	3:56:45	like 
216	3:57:0	3:57:4	ok 
217	3:57:24	3:57:25	and there a plane crash 
218	3:58:4	3:58:7	around the bottom of it 
219	3:59:6	3:59:15	no 
221	4:1:1	4:1:4	and 
222	4:3:28	4:3:36	yes IY go towards the lake 
223	4:4:26	4:4:33	no 
224	4:6:28	4:6:28	and IY go straight up 
226	4:8:5	4:8:10	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
227	4:10:39	4:10:42	uhm IY straighten out slope 
228	4:11:42	4:11:50	what 
231	4:14:49	4:14:53	ok 
233	4:17:40	4:17:40	and 
234	4:19:44	4:19:51	ok

242	4:23:12	4:23:20	like three inch 
243	4:25:3	4:25:11	to the right 
244	4:25:36	4:25:37	IY go about 
245	4:26:39	4:26:44	ok IY at the savannah 
246	4:27:17	4:27:20	probably the same thing 
247	4:27:22	4:27:28	ok 
248	4:27:35	4:27:43	a quarter of an inch 
249	4:28:2	4:28:9	ok 
250	4:29:14	4:29:20	that little slope 
251	4:30:30	4:30:33	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
252	4:32:12	4:32:20	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
253	4:33:17	4:33:17	uh like 
255	4:35:2	4:35:8	alright be IY start near the 
256	4:35:31	4:35:35	well alright 
257	4:35:31	4:35:38	and then 
258	4:35:45	4:35:50	IY kind of go 
259	4:38:19	4:38:22	and slope be about an inch long 
260	4:39:57	4:40:6	so IY at the hot spring 
261	4:40:58	4:40:58	well 
262	4:42:32	4:42:35	IY start at the stony desert 
263	4:44:7	4:44:14	but 
267	4:48:36	4:48:45	not right at the stony desert 
269	4:50:47	4:50:52	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
270	4:52:17	4:52:20	so that about IY would say 
271	4:56:9	4:56:16	ok 
272	4:57:7	4:57:12	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
273	4:57:40	4:57:41	alright alright well just 
274	4:58:36	4:58:38	maybe like 
276	4:58:53	4:59:1	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
279	5:3:41	5:3:48	so anyway 
280	5:4:8	5:4:16	they there 
281	5:4:34	5:4:34	for about two inch 
282	5:6:11	5:6:20	ok 
283	5:7:16	5:7:17	maybe 
285	5:8:37	5:8:46	now IY at the collapse shelter 
287	5:15:16	5:15:25	three inch 
288	5:17:24	5:17:33	IY slope down again 
289	5:19:8	5:19:13	and then IY go straight 
291	5:22:46	5:22:51	ok 
293	5:24:55	5:25:0	uhm 
294	5:25:30	5:25:39	IY move to the leave 
295	5:25:38	5:25:45	no IY don have any rock 
296	5:27:15	5:27:22	be IY anywhere near there 
298	5:32:59	5:33:7	like an inch 
299	5:34:0	5:34:1	and be to the leave 
301	5:36:19	5:36:28	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
303	5:41:50	5:41:50	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
304	5:42:1	5:42:3	IY go like 
305	5:42:11	5:42:20	after IY go straight again 
306	5:42:19	5:42:26	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
308	5:46:5	5:46:12	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
313	5:47:46	5:47:47	uhm and there be a stony desert 
314	5:50:9	5:50:12	to the lake 
315	5:51:21	5:51:26	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
316	5:51:49	5:51:52	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
318	5:56:27	5:56:32	to the leave 
319	5:58:29	5:58:30	about like 
320	5:59:15	5:59:23	uhm 
321	6:1:21	6:1:22	maybe IY have different thing 
322	6:2:21	6:2:29	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
323	6:3:15	6:3:23	no IY don have a waterhole 
324	6:5:11	6:5:12	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
326	6:5:54	6:5:57	just a slight slope 
327	6:6:6	6:6:10	to the leave 
329	6:6:17	6:6:22	uhm 
330	6:8:4	6:8:8	after IY slope down IY say 
333	6:8:30	6:8:39	uhm 
334	6:10:0	6:10:1	IY go straight down 
335	6:12:10	6:12:17	ok well 
337	6:15:34	6:15:39	well 
338	6:16:44	6:16:51	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
339	6:17:14	6:17:15	just do it like this ok 
342	6:19:34	6:19:38	an inch maybe a little bit less 
start f
3	0:1:56	0:2:1	and to the right 
5	0:3:2	0:3:2	uh IY don know know what to say 
7	0:5:12	0:5:15	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
9	0:8:55	0:8:58	mm Hmm 
11	0:10:20	0:10:29	to the leave of the antelope 
12	0:12:33	0:12:37	mm Hmm 
13	0:12:39	0:12:48	ok 
14	0:13:37	0:13:43	around the top of the lake 
29	0:29:1	0:29:10	mm Hmm 
31	0:30:42	0:30:49	ok 
32	0:33:23	0:33:25	mm mm

43	0:43:28	0:43:31	ok 
47	0:48:50	0:48:55	no IY go with hot spring IY have 
48	0:50:29	0:50:33	IY a plane crash though 
57	0:57:34	0:57:40	and curve down to the leave 
66	1:7:52	1:7:59	ok 
69	1:10:27	1:10:34	mm Hmm

90	1:43:54	1:44:3	and there a collapse shelter 
91	1:45:11	1:45:19	do IY go through anything 
93	1:47:14	1:47:20	ok 
101	1:54:6	1:54:7	ok 
105	2:0:17	2:0:22	IY start yeah the stony desert 
109	2:2:58	2:3:0	mm Hmm 
111	2:6:40	2:6:42	how many inch do IY think 
117	2:13:7	2:13:9	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave

239	4:20:57	4:21:6	ok 
241	4:23:6	4:23:8	ok 
254	4:34:1	4:34:1	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash 
264	4:47:1	4:47:7	IY go to a lake 
265	4:47:0	4:47:7	ok 
266	4:47:27	4:47:28	up tp the right

311	5:47:11	5:47:13	IY plane crash IY be talk about earlier that up there 
312	5:47:16	5:47:19	ok 
317	5:56:19	5:56:26	IY hit some round rock

341	6:17:54	6:17:54	yeah 
start g
0	0:0:12	0:0:20	after plane crash 
1	0:1:26	0:1:31	to the leave 
2	0:1:47	0:1:54	and then 
4	0:2:26	0:2:28	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
6	0:4:19	0:4:24	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
8	0:5:47	0:5:52	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
10	0:8:58	0:9:0	after the circle 
15	0:13:52	0:14:1	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
16	0:16:49	0:16:57	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
17	0:17:47	0:17:56	ok

51	0:53:20	0:53:25	and then 
52	0:53:38	0:53:46	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
53	0:54:47	0:54:52	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
54	0:55:22	0:55:31	where IY go down to a plane crash 
55	0:56:55	0:57:0	and then IY go 
56	0:57:20	0:57:26	so IY make circle 
58	0:58:26	0:58:30	ok plane crash isn there 
59	0:59:5	0:59:13	uhm 
60	1:0:56	1:0:57	for like 
61	1:1:15	1:1:24	right next to circle should be roman bath 
62	1:1:42	1:1:49	well just 
63	1:2:35	1:2:40	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
64	1:4:26	1:4:26	like four or five inch to the leave 
65	1:6:2	1:6:5	uhm 
67	1:8:37	1:8:44	the slate mountain be towards the right 
68	1:9:31	1:9:40	IY get 
72	1:12:2	1:12:3	be IY in like 
74	1:16:24	1:16:31	and then IY be

79	1:25:30	1:25:37	and IY go up like 
80	1:26:41	1:26:43	and that where the plane crash be 
81	1:28:15	1:28:23	on sheet anyway 
82	1:28:36	1:28:40	no there no elephant 
83	1:29:47	1:29:48	four or five inch to the leave

120	2:17:37	2:17:41	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
121	2:17:57	2:18:4	straight up

188	3:21:39	3:21:40	and then IY you go up 
189	3:21:39	3:21:48	IY at the plane crash 
192	3:23:40	3:23:42	plane crash 
194	3:25:11	3:25:18	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
196	3:28:31	3:28:34	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn

200	3:32:12	3:32:18	and then 
201	3:33:57	3:34:4	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
202	3:34:30	3:34:30	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
204	3:35:43	3:35:46	uhm 
205	3:36:42	3:36:46	and 
206	3:37:56	3:37:56	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
207	3:39:38	3:39:45	be the plane crash 
208	3:39:57	3:40:4	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
209	3:41:28	3:41:35	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
213	3:48:12	3:48:19	to right

216	3:57:0	3:57:4	ok 
217	3:57:24	3:57:25	and there a plane crash 
218	3:58:4	3:58:7	around the bottom of it 
219	3:59:6	3:59:15	no 
221	4:1:1	4:1:4	and 
222	4:3:28	4:3:36	yes IY go towards the lake 
223	4:4:26	4:4:33	no 
224	4:6:28	4:6:28	and IY go straight up 
226	4:8:5	4:8:10	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
227	4:10:39	4:10:42	uhm IY straighten out slope 
228	4:11:42	4:11:50	what 
231	4:14:49	4:14:53	ok

249	4:28:2	4:28:9	ok 
250	4:29:14	4:29:20	that little slope 
251	4:30:30	4:30:33	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
252	4:32:12	4:32:20	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
253	4:33:17	4:33:17	uh like 
255	4:35:2	4:35:8	alright be IY start near the 
256	4:35:31	4:35:35	well alright

259	4:38:19	4:38:22	and slope be about an inch long 
260	4:39:57	4:40:6	so IY at the hot spring 
261	4:40:58	4:40:58	well 
262	4:42:32	4:42:35	IY start at the stony desert 
263	4:44:7	4:44:14	but 
267	4:48:36	4:48:45	not right at the stony desert 
269	4:50:47	4:50:52	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
270	4:52:17	4:52:20	so that about IY would say 
271	4:56:9	4:56:16	ok 
272	4:57:7	4:57:12	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
273	4:57:40	4:57:41	alright alright well just 
274	4:58:36	4:58:38	maybe like 
276	4:58:53	4:59:1	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s

283	5:7:16	5:7:17	maybe 
285	5:8:37	5:8:46	now IY at the collapse shelter 
287	5:15:16	5:15:25	three inch 
288	5:17:24	5:17:33	IY slope down again 
289	5:19:8	5:19:13	and then IY go straight 
291	5:22:46	5:22:51	ok 
293	5:24:55	5:25:0	uhm

296	5:27:15	5:27:22	be IY anywhere near there 
298	5:32:59	5:33:7	like an inch 
299	5:34:0	5:34:1	and be to the leave 
301	5:36:19	5:36:28	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
303	5:41:50	5:41:50	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
304	5:42:1	5:42:3	IY go like 
305	5:42:11	5:42:20	after IY go straight again 
306	5:42:19	5:42:26	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
308	5:46:5	5:46:12	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
313	5:47:46	5:47:47	uhm and there be a stony desert 
314	5:50:9	5:50:12	to the lake 
315	5:51:21	5:51:26	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
316	5:51:49	5:51:52	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
318	5:56:27	5:56:32	to the leave 
319	5:58:29	5:58:30	about like
