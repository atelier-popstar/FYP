start
start g
0	0:1:21	0:1:24	and then 
5	0:5:48	0:5:52	and IY go straight up 
6	0:8:55	0:9:3	and then 
7	0:9:11	0:9:18	ok 
8	0:10:57	0:11:2	and IY slope to the leave 
12	0:13:20	0:13:28	ok 
13	0:13:58	0:14:4	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
14	0:14:31	0:14:40	ok 
16	0:17:3	0:17:3	do IY have roman bath 
17	0:18:17	0:18:22	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
19	0:18:55	0:18:59	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
20	0:18:59	0:19:8	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
21	0:19:41	0:19:42	alright 
22	0:19:51	0:19:54	be IY anywere near there 
23	0:20:1	0:20:3	to the leave of little path where path should be 
24	0:20:11	0:20:12	and then IY go 
26	0:22:8	0:22:12	ok and then IY go 
27	0:25:16	0:25:20	IY slope 
28	0:25:58	0:26:5	ok 
31	0:28:13	0:28:18	no 
32	0:29:29	0:29:34	from 
33	0:29:46	0:29:47	IY go straight down 
34	0:31:3	0:31:4	to the lake 
35	0:31:28	0:31:35	ok IY at the savannah 
36	0:32:33	0:32:34	uhm 
38	0:33:53	0:34:1	be IY anywhere near there 
39	0:33:58	0:34:2	after IY go straight again 
41	0:36:24	0:36:24	away about like four inch four or five inch 
42	0:38:27	0:38:29	IY move to the leave 
43	0:39:48	0:39:57	alright alright well just 
44	0:40:6	0:40:14	and 
45	0:40:7	0:40:15	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
46	0:42:1	0:42:10	be the plane crash 
48	0:44:16	0:44:25	uhm 
49	0:44:59	0:45:2	ok 
50	0:44:57	0:45:4	and then IY slope up 
51	0:51:21	0:51:25	ok well 
53	0:54:33	0:54:34	uhm 
54	0:56:5	0:56:7	and then 
55	0:57:28	0:57:31	around the bottom of it 
56	0:57:29	0:57:38	IY don know 
58	1:1:1	1:1:8	there a there 
59	1:2:37	1:2:42	IY slope down again 
60	1:4:13	1:4:21	and then IY you go up 
62	1:6:40	1:6:42	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
63	1:6:57	1:7:6	well just 
64	1:7:34	1:7:38	uhm 
66	1:8:14	1:8:17	IY start 
69	1:10:20	1:10:29	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
70	1:13:10	1:13:16	ok 
71	1:14:27	1:14:31	three inch 
74	1:16:22	1:16:27	IY get 
75	1:17:12	1:17:17	kind of across from stony desert 
76	1:18:44	1:18:44	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
78	1:21:7	1:21:7	IY wanna kind of curve 
80	1:21:54	1:22:3	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
81	1:22:2	1:22:9	ok 
82	1:22:23	1:22:23	like 
83	1:22:36	1:22:45	that about five or six inch

85	1:25:55	1:26:2	ok 
87	1:27:46	1:27:46	to right 
88	1:28:5	1:28:8	uhm 
91	1:29:18	1:29:24	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
92	1:29:42	1:29:48	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
93	1:29:58	1:29:59	yes 
94	1:30:39	1:30:47	straight up 
96	1:31:25	1:31:33	IY have a waterhole on map 
97	1:31:36	1:31:41	the 
99	1:33:0	1:33:1	like maybe an inch 
100	1:35:7	1:35:8	alright be IY start near the 
101	1:35:29	1:35:36	and slope be about an inch long 
102	1:36:11	1:36:13	ok 
103	1:36:37	1:36:45	IY go about 
104	1:37:30	1:37:39	be IY in like 
105	1:38:58	1:39:7	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
106	1:41:29	1:41:35	and then IY slope 
107	1:42:20	1:42:24	IY at the plane crash 
108	1:44:9	1:44:13	IY make 
109	1:44:25	1:44:28	uhm 
110	1:45:42	1:45:43	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
111	1:47:27	1:47:33	IY just kind of slope down 
113	1:50:16	1:50:23	ok 
115	1:55:7	1:55:9	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
116	1:55:46	1:55:50	and then 
119	1:57:21	1:57:24	ok 
121	1:58:11	1:58:14	for about two inch 
122	1:58:42	1:58:44	ok 
125	2:2:49	2:2:52	and IY just go straight up 
126	2:3:15	2:3:21	to the white mountain 
127	2:4:36	2:4:37	ok 
129	2:5:10	2:5:12	ok 
132	2:11:10	2:11:16	ok 
133	2:12:12	2:12:12	IY actually start like right 
134	2:12:25	2:12:31	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
137	2:17:57	2:18:2	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
138	2:20:39	2:20:39	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
141	2:21:47	2:21:49	for like 
143	2:22:48	2:22:56	after the circle 
144	2:23:52	2:23:52	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
145	2:24:39	2:24:48	ok 
146	2:24:49	2:24:49	like an inch 
147	2:28:11	2:28:13	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
148	2:28:26	2:28:30	alright well IY keep go and see 
149	2:28:35	2:28:42	IY kind of go 
150	2:29:52	2:29:56	uhm 
152	2:32:46	2:32:49	and IY go up like 
153	2:34:10	2:34:16	IY start at the stony desert 
154	2:35:32	2:35:35	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
155	2:36:6	2:36:9	well 
156	2:37:7	2:37:14	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
157	2:39:47	2:39:54	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
159	2:45:41	2:45:49	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
160	2:46:8	2:46:16	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
161	2:47:30	2:47:38	like 
163	2:48:40	2:48:48	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
165	2:50:51	2:50:56	about like 
166	2:50:58	2:51:1	yes 
168	2:52:52	2:52:55	what 
169	2:53:43	2:53:46	ok 
170	2:54:33	2:54:40	so IY at the hot spring 
171	2:54:55	2:54:58	right next to circle should be roman bath 
172	2:55:46	2:55:47	just do it like this ok 
173	2:56:40	2:56:41	so that about IY would say 
175	2:58:34	2:58:38	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
176	3:2:48	3:2:53	like four or five inch to the leave 
178	3:9:33	3:9:42	IY go like 
179	3:9:52	3:9:53	for like 
181	3:15:55	3:15:57	like three inch 
182	3:16:56	3:17:3	uhm 
183	3:18:11	3:18:18	uhhh no 
184	3:18:54	3:19:1	it not a big curve 
186	3:20:23	3:20:30	what 
187	3:21:35	3:21:42	IY would say 
188	3:22:28	3:22:35	be IY 
190	3:25:28	3:25:30	and it slope a little bit to the right 
191	3:25:55	3:26:4	ok 
196	3:32:42	3:32:47	Hmm 
197	3:33:31	3:33:32	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
198	3:34:10	3:34:14	ok 
199	3:34:12	3:34:19	maybe 
200	3:34:22	3:34:27	ok 
201	3:36:39	3:36:44	ok 
203	3:37:9	3:37:10	and 
204	3:40:25	3:40:27	well alright 
205	3:40:58	3:40:58	three inch 
206	3:41:16	3:41:17	uhm 
207	3:41:51	3:41:53	so 
208	3:42:40	3:42:44	IY just go down 
209	3:42:57	3:42:57	yes IY go towards the lake 
210	3:43:31	3:43:34	uhm 
212	3:44:20	3:44:20	an inch maybe a little bit less 
213	3:45:33	3:45:35	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
219	3:52:15	3:52:15	maybe four inch on the paper 
220	3:52:58	3:53:0	a little 
221	3:54:0	3:54:7	no there no elephant 
222	3:56:46	3:56:55	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
223	3:58:17	3:58:24	and be to the leave 
225	4:5:29	4:5:29	alright 
226	4:5:47	4:5:50	and IY go 
227	4:5:58	4:6:3	uhm 
228	4:12:7	4:12:13	and then IY go down 
229	4:12:23	4:12:32	just a slight slope 
230	4:12:47	4:12:47	three inch straight across 
231	4:13:3	4:13:6	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
232	4:13:56	4:14:5	and there a plane crash 
233	4:14:35	4:14:41	and then IY slope down to the leave 
234	4:15:30	4:15:33	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
236	4:18:30	4:18:33	ok 
237	4:23:55	4:23:58	no 
238	4:25:22	4:25:22	and 
239	4:25:52	4:25:56	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
240	4:26:22	4:26:30	uhm 
241	4:28:1	4:28:5	to the leave 
242	4:28:37	4:28:43	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
243	4:28:50	4:28:50	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
244	4:28:58	4:29:5	and that where the plane crash be 
245	4:30:50	4:30:58	couple mile or something 
247	4:31:47	4:31:51	and 
248	4:33:20	4:33:25	maybe like 
249	4:36:57	4:37:0	probably the same thing 
250	4:36:59	4:37:3	to the leave 
251	4:38:42	4:38:49	ok plane crash isn there 
253	4:40:59	4:41:6	like 
254	4:41:17	4:41:18	uhm IY straighten out slope 
256	4:41:30	4:41:36	ok 
257	4:41:35	4:41:43	five 
258	4:43:10	4:43:18	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
259	4:45:25	4:45:31	they there 
260	4:46:32	4:46:32	go up like three three and a half inch 
261	4:49:33	4:49:37	and IY should have a straight line there 
262	4:52:59	4:53:6	and then IY come to a savannah 
263	4:53:8	4:53:17	where IY go down to a plane crash 
264	4:53:31	4:53:35	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
265	4:54:10	4:54:15	so anyway 
267	4:56:6	4:56:15	uhm 
268	4:57:21	4:57:25	after plane crash 
269	4:59:33	4:59:34	the slate mountain be towards the right 
270	5:1:16	5:1:20	to the right 
271	5:1:34	5:1:39	and then 
272	5:3:7	5:3:9	and then 
274	5:3:18	5:3:23	uhm 
275	5:3:50	5:3:54	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
276	5:5:22	5:5:29	uhm 
277	5:6:7	5:6:11	and then IY be 
278	5:6:8	5:6:13	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
279	5:6:36	5:6:45	not right at the stony desert 
281	5:10:0	5:10:5	to the leave 
282	5:11:41	5:11:42	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
283	5:14:24	5:14:29	like IY slope 
284	5:14:42	5:14:51	uh like 
286	5:15:26	5:15:29	ok 
288	5:15:58	5:15:59	on sheet anyway 
289	5:16:26	5:16:29	but 
290	5:16:36	5:16:41	couple inch IY slope down 
293	5:19:40	5:19:45	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
294	5:20:14	5:20:16	a quarter of an inch 
295	5:22:55	5:22:55	so IY make circle 
296	5:23:56	5:24:1	so IY go three inch straight 
297	5:25:33	5:25:33	and then 
298	5:26:11	5:26:19	and then 
299	5:29:33	5:29:41	no IY don have a waterhole 
300	5:29:42	5:29:46	uhm 
301	5:30:5	5:30:6	after IY slope down IY say 
302	5:30:54	5:30:55	like 
303	5:32:52	5:32:58	a little bit too 
304	5:33:11	5:33:12	ok well 
305	5:33:19	5:33:22	that little slope 
306	5:34:12	5:34:18	plane crash 
308	5:34:46	5:34:51	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
313	5:42:6	5:42:6	no IY have 
316	5:45:35	5:45:43	uhm 
317	5:48:51	5:48:52	maybe like 
318	5:51:28	5:51:31	four or five inch to the leave 
322	6:1:29	6:1:32	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
323	6:2:31	6:2:39	uhm and there be a stony desert 
324	6:2:45	6:2:53	have a s 
326	6:4:25	6:4:28	ok 
327	6:6:59	6:7:4	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
328	6:8:5	6:8:5	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
330	6:8:39	6:8:46	be IY in like almost the top of the 
333	6:11:6	6:11:7	IY 
336	6:12:15	6:12:24	then 
337	6:13:56	6:14:0	maybe IY have different thing 
338	6:14:39	6:14:46	well 
339	6:18:10	6:18:13	now IY at the collapse shelter 
340	6:18:42	6:18:50	no IY don have any rock 
341	6:22:23	6:22:28	and then IY go straight 
342	6:22:31	6:22:38	it right next to it 
start f
1	0:2:4	0:2:7	up tp the right 
2	0:2:47	0:2:55	mm Hmm 
3	0:3:17	0:3:24	and there a collapse shelter 
4	0:5:48	0:5:49	nope 
9	0:11:58	0:12:4	ok 
10	0:12:59	0:13:0	but that like five six inch from where IY be now 
11	0:13:5	0:13:14	to 
15	0:14:37	0:14:44	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
18	0:18:38	0:18:47	and 
25	0:20:13	0:20:19	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash 
29	0:26:0	0:26:7	to the right 
30	0:27:50	0:27:58	do IY go through anything 
37	0:33:20	0:33:23	ok wait hold on 
40	0:34:22	0:34:25	yeah 
47	0:43:43	0:43:51	IY at the savannah 
52	0:53:0	0:53:5	oh 
57	0:57:46	0:57:54	ok 
61	1:5:23	1:5:29	yeah and IY go straight up 
65	1:7:59	1:8:0	ok 
67	1:8:37	1:8:38	ok 
68	1:9:35	1:9:35	ok 
72	1:14:32	1:14:35	ok

89	1:28:0	1:28:9	ok 
90	1:28:44	1:28:46	and to the right 
95	1:31:32	1:31:32	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
98	1:32:18	1:32:27	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
112	1:48:26	1:48:28	IY go to a lake 
114	1:53:48	1:53:55	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
117	1:55:47	1:55:52	ok 
118	1:57:14	1:57:14	yeah 
120	1:57:24	1:57:26	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
123	1:59:57	1:59:59	it not like in the same place IY describe 
124	1:59:57	1:59:59	ok 
128	2:4:46	2:4:47	IY three inch above the savannah

131	2:10:6	2:10:10	ok 
135	2:14:10	2:14:11	plane crash be on the other side but IY just ok 
136	2:15:43	2:15:46	yeah 
139	2:20:35	2:20:41	ok 
140	2:20:57	2:21:1	no IY go with hot spring IY have

151	2:32:11	2:32:16	ok 
158	2:43:49	2:43:54	IY plane crash IY be talk about earlier that up there 
162	2:48:44	2:48:45	mm Hmm 
164	2:50:48	2:50:55	yeah 
167	2:51:32	2:51:36	yeah

273	5:3:10	5:3:17	mm Hmm 
280	5:9:36	5:9:38	IY a plane crash though 
285	5:14:59	5:15:5	do IY go by the plane crash 
287	5:15:50	5:15:54	around the top of the lake 
291	5:16:42	5:16:43	mm Hmm 
292	5:18:21	5:18:24	nope IY have a white mountain 
307	5:34:38	5:34:38	ok 
309	5:34:55	5:34:58	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
310	5:37:10	5:37:18	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
311	5:39:20	5:39:28	so wait 
312	5:41:4	5:41:13	elephant

319	5:56:3	5:56:5	IY know IY have different thing so 
320	6:0:3	6:0:10	ok 
321	6:1:13	6:1:15	ok 
325	6:3:23	6:3:24	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
329	6:8:17	6:8:17	ok 
331	6:9:14	6:9:18	mm Hmm 
332	6:10:48	6:10:54	IY hit some rock though

12	0:13:20	0:13:28	ok 
13	0:13:58	0:14:4	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
14	0:14:31	0:14:40	ok 
16	0:17:3	0:17:3	do IY have roman bath 
17	0:18:17	0:18:22	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
19	0:18:55	0:18:59	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
20	0:18:59	0:19:8	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
21	0:19:41	0:19:42	alright

34	0:31:3	0:31:4	to the lake 
35	0:31:28	0:31:35	ok IY at the savannah 
36	0:32:33	0:32:34	uhm 
38	0:33:53	0:34:1	be IY anywhere near there 
39	0:33:58	0:34:2	after IY go straight again 
41	0:36:24	0:36:24	away about like four inch four or five inch 
42	0:38:27	0:38:29	IY move to the leave 
43	0:39:48	0:39:57	alright alright well just 
44	0:40:6	0:40:14	and 
45	0:40:7	0:40:15	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
46	0:42:1	0:42:10	be the plane crash 
48	0:44:16	0:44:25	uhm 
49	0:44:59	0:45:2	ok 
50	0:44:57	0:45:4	and then IY slope up 
51	0:51:21	0:51:25	ok well

58	1:1:1	1:1:8	there a there 
59	1:2:37	1:2:42	IY slope down again 
60	1:4:13	1:4:21	and then IY you go up 
62	1:6:40	1:6:42	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
63	1:6:57	1:7:6	well just 
64	1:7:34	1:7:38	uhm 
66	1:8:14	1:8:17	IY start 
69	1:10:20	1:10:29	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
70	1:13:10	1:13:16	ok 
71	1:14:27	1:14:31	three inch 
74	1:16:22	1:16:27	IY get 
75	1:17:12	1:17:17	kind of across from stony desert 
76	1:18:44	1:18:44	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
78	1:21:7	1:21:7	IY wanna kind of curve 
80	1:21:54	1:22:3	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
81	1:22:2	1:22:9	ok 
82	1:22:23	1:22:23	like 
83	1:22:36	1:22:45	that about five or six inch

88	1:28:5	1:28:8	uhm 
91	1:29:18	1:29:24	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
92	1:29:42	1:29:48	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
93	1:29:58	1:29:59	yes 
94	1:30:39	1:30:47	straight up 
96	1:31:25	1:31:33	IY have a waterhole on map 
97	1:31:36	1:31:41	the 
99	1:33:0	1:33:1	like maybe an inch 
100	1:35:7	1:35:8	alright be IY start near the 
101	1:35:29	1:35:36	and slope be about an inch long 
102	1:36:11	1:36:13	ok 
103	1:36:37	1:36:45	IY go about 
104	1:37:30	1:37:39	be IY in like 
105	1:38:58	1:39:7	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
106	1:41:29	1:41:35	and then IY slope 
107	1:42:20	1:42:24	IY at the plane crash 
108	1:44:9	1:44:13	IY make 
109	1:44:25	1:44:28	uhm 
110	1:45:42	1:45:43	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
111	1:47:27	1:47:33	IY just kind of slope down 
113	1:50:16	1:50:23	ok 
115	1:55:7	1:55:9	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
116	1:55:46	1:55:50	and then 
119	1:57:21	1:57:24	ok 
121	1:58:11	1:58:14	for about two inch 
122	1:58:42	1:58:44	ok 
125	2:2:49	2:2:52	and IY just go straight up 
126	2:3:15	2:3:21	to the white mountain 
127	2:4:36	2:4:37	ok 
129	2:5:10	2:5:12	ok 
132	2:11:10	2:11:16	ok 
133	2:12:12	2:12:12	IY actually start like right 
134	2:12:25	2:12:31	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
137	2:17:57	2:18:2	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
138	2:20:39	2:20:39	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
141	2:21:47	2:21:49	for like 
143	2:22:48	2:22:56	after the circle 
144	2:23:52	2:23:52	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
145	2:24:39	2:24:48	ok 
146	2:24:49	2:24:49	like an inch 
147	2:28:11	2:28:13	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
148	2:28:26	2:28:30	alright well IY keep go and see 
149	2:28:35	2:28:42	IY kind of go 
150	2:29:52	2:29:56	uhm 
152	2:32:46	2:32:49	and IY go up like 
153	2:34:10	2:34:16	IY start at the stony desert 
154	2:35:32	2:35:35	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
155	2:36:6	2:36:9	well 
156	2:37:7	2:37:14	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
157	2:39:47	2:39:54	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
159	2:45:41	2:45:49	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
160	2:46:8	2:46:16	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
161	2:47:30	2:47:38	like 
163	2:48:40	2:48:48	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
165	2:50:51	2:50:56	about like 
166	2:50:58	2:51:1	yes 
168	2:52:52	2:52:55	what 
169	2:53:43	2:53:46	ok 
170	2:54:33	2:54:40	so IY at the hot spring 
171	2:54:55	2:54:58	right next to circle should be roman bath 
172	2:55:46	2:55:47	just do it like this ok 
173	2:56:40	2:56:41	so that about IY would say 
175	2:58:34	2:58:38	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
176	3:2:48	3:2:53	like four or five inch to the leave 
178	3:9:33	3:9:42	IY go like 
179	3:9:52	3:9:53	for like 
181	3:15:55	3:15:57	like three inch 
182	3:16:56	3:17:3	uhm 
183	3:18:11	3:18:18	uhhh no 
184	3:18:54	3:19:1	it not a big curve 
186	3:20:23	3:20:30	what 
187	3:21:35	3:21:42	IY would say 
188	3:22:28	3:22:35	be IY 
190	3:25:28	3:25:30	and it slope a little bit to the right 
191	3:25:55	3:26:4	ok 
196	3:32:42	3:32:47	Hmm 
197	3:33:31	3:33:32	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
198	3:34:10	3:34:14	ok 
199	3:34:12	3:34:19	maybe 
200	3:34:22	3:34:27	ok

206	3:41:16	3:41:17	uhm 
207	3:41:51	3:41:53	so 
208	3:42:40	3:42:44	IY just go down 
209	3:42:57	3:42:57	yes IY go towards the lake 
210	3:43:31	3:43:34	uhm 
212	3:44:20	3:44:20	an inch maybe a little bit less 
213	3:45:33	3:45:35	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
219	3:52:15	3:52:15	maybe four inch on the paper 
220	3:52:58	3:53:0	a little 
221	3:54:0	3:54:7	no there no elephant 
222	3:56:46	3:56:55	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
223	3:58:17	3:58:24	and be to the leave 
225	4:5:29	4:5:29	alright 
226	4:5:47	4:5:50	and IY go 
227	4:5:58	4:6:3	uhm 
228	4:12:7	4:12:13	and then IY go down 
229	4:12:23	4:12:32	just a slight slope 
230	4:12:47	4:12:47	three inch straight across 
231	4:13:3	4:13:6	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
232	4:13:56	4:14:5	and there a plane crash 
233	4:14:35	4:14:41	and then IY slope down to the leave 
234	4:15:30	4:15:33	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
236	4:18:30	4:18:33	ok 
237	4:23:55	4:23:58	no 
238	4:25:22	4:25:22	and 
239	4:25:52	4:25:56	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
240	4:26:22	4:26:30	uhm 
241	4:28:1	4:28:5	to the leave 
242	4:28:37	4:28:43	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
243	4:28:50	4:28:50	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
244	4:28:58	4:29:5	and that where the plane crash be 
245	4:30:50	4:30:58	couple mile or something 
247	4:31:47	4:31:51	and 
248	4:33:20	4:33:25	maybe like 
249	4:36:57	4:37:0	probably the same thing 
250	4:36:59	4:37:3	to the leave 
251	4:38:42	4:38:49	ok plane crash isn there 
253	4:40:59	4:41:6	like 
254	4:41:17	4:41:18	uhm IY straighten out slope 
256	4:41:30	4:41:36	ok 
257	4:41:35	4:41:43	five 
258	4:43:10	4:43:18	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
259	4:45:25	4:45:31	they there 
260	4:46:32	4:46:32	go up like three three and a half inch 
261	4:49:33	4:49:37	and IY should have a straight line there 
262	4:52:59	4:53:6	and then IY come to a savannah 
263	4:53:8	4:53:17	where IY go down to a plane crash 
264	4:53:31	4:53:35	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
265	4:54:10	4:54:15	so anyway 
267	4:56:6	4:56:15	uhm 
268	4:57:21	4:57:25	after plane crash 
269	4:59:33	4:59:34	the slate mountain be towards the right 
270	5:1:16	5:1:20	to the right 
271	5:1:34	5:1:39	and then 
272	5:3:7	5:3:9	and then 
274	5:3:18	5:3:23	uhm 
275	5:3:50	5:3:54	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
276	5:5:22	5:5:29	uhm 
277	5:6:7	5:6:11	and then IY be 
278	5:6:8	5:6:13	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
279	5:6:36	5:6:45	not right at the stony desert 
281	5:10:0	5:10:5	to the leave 
282	5:11:41	5:11:42	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
283	5:14:24	5:14:29	like IY slope 
284	5:14:42	5:14:51	uh like 
286	5:15:26	5:15:29	ok 
288	5:15:58	5:15:59	on sheet anyway 
289	5:16:26	5:16:29	but 
290	5:16:36	5:16:41	couple inch IY slope down 
293	5:19:40	5:19:45	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
294	5:20:14	5:20:16	a quarter of an inch 
295	5:22:55	5:22:55	so IY make circle 
296	5:23:56	5:24:1	so IY go three inch straight 
297	5:25:33	5:25:33	and then 
298	5:26:11	5:26:19	and then 
299	5:29:33	5:29:41	no IY don have a waterhole 
300	5:29:42	5:29:46	uhm 
301	5:30:5	5:30:6	after IY slope down IY say 
302	5:30:54	5:30:55	like 
303	5:32:52	5:32:58	a little bit too 
304	5:33:11	5:33:12	ok well 
305	5:33:19	5:33:22	that little slope 
306	5:34:12	5:34:18	plane crash 
308	5:34:46	5:34:51	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
313	5:42:6	5:42:6	no IY have
