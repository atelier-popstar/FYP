start
start g
0	0:0:2	0:0:4	no IY don have any rock 
1	0:2:19	0:2:19	ok IY at the savannah 
2	0:2:46	0:2:46	IY kind of go 
4	0:2:49	0:2:52	and then IY come to a savannah 
5	0:3:48	0:3:57	like 
6	0:4:14	0:4:22	three inch straight across 
7	0:4:42	0:4:48	and IY just go straight up 
8	0:4:44	0:4:52	ok 
10	0:8:41	0:8:43	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
11	0:12:4	0:12:6	ok 
13	0:12:26	0:12:28	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
14	0:13:24	0:13:30	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
16	0:16:5	0:16:8	after plane crash 
17	0:16:39	0:16:39	right next to circle should be roman bath 
18	0:18:52	0:18:52	ok 
21	0:24:19	0:24:27	IY start 
22	0:25:37	0:25:44	like an inch 
24	0:27:21	0:27:26	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
25	0:30:9	0:30:15	and 
28	0:31:22	0:31:27	uhm 
29	0:32:48	0:32:52	alright alright well just 
31	0:35:32	0:35:33	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
32	0:38:0	0:38:8	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
33	0:39:46	0:39:53	for like 
35	0:42:51	0:42:57	so that about IY would say 
36	0:43:36	0:43:44	IY at the plane crash 
37	0:43:56	0:44:1	ok 
39	0:47:9	0:47:16	uhm 
40	0:47:43	0:47:47	not right at the stony desert 
41	0:47:46	0:47:47	IY have a waterhole on map 
42	0:48:36	0:48:40	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
44	0:50:30	0:50:36	ok 
45	0:52:21	0:52:26	uhm 
46	0:54:39	0:54:42	now IY at the collapse shelter 
47	0:54:39	0:54:46	ok well 
48	0:55:59	0:56:5	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
49	0:56:16	0:56:19	after IY go straight again 
50	0:57:28	0:57:29	well just 
52	0:58:0	0:58:0	what 
53	0:58:25	0:58:31	and IY go 
55	1:0:23	1:0:28	no IY don have a waterhole 
56	1:0:38	1:0:42	and 
58	1:2:2	1:2:7	so anyway 
59	1:3:14	1:3:19	and IY should have a straight line there 
60	1:4:15	1:4:16	away about like four inch four or five inch 
63	1:7:3	1:7:12	and then IY slope down to the leave 
65	1:8:24	1:8:28	and then IY go down 
66	1:12:49	1:12:56	ok 
68	1:17:58	1:17:58	three inch 
69	1:17:51	1:17:59	and 
71	1:21:23	1:21:31	they there 
72	1:22:51	1:22:57	on sheet anyway 
74	1:24:4	1:24:4	and be to the leave 
75	1:25:40	1:25:47	be IY in like 
77	1:26:15	1:26:19	IY 
78	1:27:21	1:27:26	to the leave 
79	1:27:21	1:27:29	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
80	1:28:1	1:28:5	the 
81	1:29:52	1:29:56	to the white mountain 
83	1:31:6	1:31:10	do IY have roman bath 
84	1:31:33	1:31:35	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
85	1:31:42	1:31:47	and 
86	1:32:27	1:32:31	and that where the plane crash be 
88	1:33:35	1:33:38	ok 
89	1:34:3	1:34:8	ok 
92	1:38:57	1:38:57	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
93	1:40:59	1:41:1	ok 
94	1:41:18	1:41:23	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
95	1:42:55	1:42:56	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
97	1:43:55	1:44:1	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
98	1:43:55	1:44:3	uhm IY straighten out slope 
99	1:45:27	1:45:31	ok 
100	1:47:23	1:47:29	be IY 
101	1:49:4	1:49:5	and then 
103	1:55:25	1:55:29	a little 
104	1:55:29	1:55:34	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
105	1:55:45	1:55:48	like maybe an inch 
106	1:56:11	1:56:18	and then IY go straight 
107	1:57:44	1:57:51	IY make 
108	1:59:9	1:59:18	a little bit too 
109	2:0:11	2:0:17	like IY slope 
111	2:0:37	2:0:45	and it slope a little bit to the right 
112	2:2:37	2:2:45	maybe like 
113	2:3:2	2:3:5	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
114	2:3:58	2:4:6	ok 
116	2:5:48	2:5:48	and IY go up like 
117	2:11:24	2:11:26	and then IY you go up 
118	2:12:12	2:12:14	uh like 
120	2:15:10	2:15:18	an inch maybe a little bit less 
121	2:15:26	2:15:28	but 
123	2:18:8	2:18:13	a quarter of an inch 
128	2:23:51	2:23:56	to the lake 
129	2:25:4	2:25:6	ok 
130	2:26:53	2:27:1	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
131	2:28:29	2:28:32	uhm 
132	2:31:6	2:31:14	uhm 
133	2:32:21	2:32:24	to the leave of little path where path should be 
134	2:38:26	2:38:31	just a slight slope 
135	2:39:23	2:39:23	and then 
136	2:41:7	2:41:16	like 
137	2:42:49	2:42:56	ok 
142	2:55:1	2:55:9	ok 
143	2:55:53	2:55:58	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
144	2:56:30	2:56:32	it right next to it 
145	2:57:28	2:57:36	alright 
146	3:1:6	3:1:8	alright

151	3:2:41	3:2:45	Hmm 
152	3:2:55	3:2:55	maybe like 
153	3:2:54	3:2:58	uhm and there be a stony desert 
156	3:4:40	3:4:47	IY go about 
157	3:6:53	3:7:1	IY just go down 
159	3:9:18	3:9:25	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
160	3:10:30	3:10:39	five 
162	3:12:59	3:13:4	yes IY go towards the lake 
163	3:13:46	3:13:51	couple mile or something 
164	3:13:51	3:13:53	after the circle 
166	3:14:3	3:14:5	and then IY slope up 
167	3:14:10	3:14:12	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
168	3:14:31	3:14:37	that about five or six inch 
169	3:14:34	3:14:43	IY wanna kind of curve 
170	3:17:37	3:17:46	like four or five inch to the leave 
171	3:19:17	3:19:23	go up like three three and a half inch 
172	3:19:47	3:19:47	uhm 
173	3:21:48	3:21:55	four or five inch to the leave 
174	3:22:19	3:22:27	IY don know 
175	3:22:52	3:22:57	uhm 
176	3:25:34	3:25:34	like three inch

180	3:32:39	3:32:39	ok well 
182	3:37:11	3:37:11	be IY anywere near there 
183	3:38:56	3:39:4	plane crash 
186	3:45:8	3:45:14	be IY anywhere near there 
187	3:46:27	3:46:28	ok 
188	3:47:23	3:47:23	so IY at the hot spring 
189	3:48:6	3:48:8	alright well IY keep go and see 
190	3:48:46	3:48:47	be IY in like almost the top of the 
193	3:50:29	3:50:30	ok 
194	3:54:45	3:54:49	uhm 
195	3:56:47	3:56:51	about like 
197	3:57:54	3:58:1	and slope be about an inch long 
198	3:58:51	3:58:51	ok 
199	3:59:41	3:59:47	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
201	4:2:2	4:2:7	where IY go down to a plane crash 
202	4:2:32	4:2:36	it not a big curve 
204	4:4:22	4:4:31	IY start at the stony desert 
205	4:5:52	4:5:57	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
207	4:7:29	4:7:30	to the leave 
208	4:8:7	4:8:16	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
209	4:11:18	4:11:20	and then IY slope 
210	4:12:19	4:12:27	maybe four inch on the paper 
211	4:12:30	4:12:38	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
212	4:13:19	4:13:19	and then IY be 
213	4:13:28	4:13:31	be the plane crash 
215	4:14:41	4:14:43	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
216	4:14:52	4:14:55	ok 
217	4:15:28	4:15:29	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
218	4:15:41	4:15:41	to right 
219	4:17:12	4:17:15	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
220	4:17:35	4:17:44	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
222	4:19:2	4:19:8	IY go like 
223	4:20:46	4:20:54	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
225	4:27:11	4:27:12	and then 
227	4:28:23	4:28:23	uhm 
228	4:30:18	4:30:18	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
229	4:31:18	4:31:21	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
230	4:31:56	4:32:5	and then 
232	4:33:1	4:33:10	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
234	4:33:36	4:33:38	just do it like this ok 
235	4:34:35	4:34:37	IY just kind of slope down 
237	4:35:29	4:35:35	ok 
238	4:35:29	4:35:36	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
239	4:36:0	4:36:0	probably the same thing 
240	4:37:38	4:37:40	uhm 
241	4:40:22	4:40:25	IY move to the leave 
242	4:41:35	4:41:43	and then IY go 
243	4:42:1	4:42:8	maybe IY have different thing 
244	4:43:35	4:43:40	kind of across from stony desert 
245	4:45:9	4:45:10	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
246	4:46:22	4:46:22	ok 
250	4:47:44	4:47:53	and IY slope to the leave 
251	4:50:36	4:50:44	and then 
253	4:53:49	4:53:50	uhm 
254	4:54:1	4:54:10	the slate mountain be towards the right 
257	4:58:28	4:58:32	and IY go straight up 
258	4:58:55	4:59:3	ok 
259	4:59:13	4:59:16	around the bottom of it 
260	5:2:44	5:2:51	yes 
264	5:7:57	5:8:2	from 
265	5:9:7	5:9:10	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
266	5:10:10	5:10:15	no 
268	5:10:16	5:10:20	so IY make circle 
269	5:12:38	5:12:39	uhm 
270	5:12:39	5:12:41	ok 
271	5:14:56	5:15:1	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
272	5:15:10	5:15:18	ok and then IY go 
273	5:15:11	5:15:20	IY would say 
275	5:18:19	5:18:21	IY get 
276	5:18:43	5:18:47	yes yeah IY just don even go near there

279	5:20:50	5:20:50	like 
280	5:20:46	5:20:51	for about two inch 
281	5:23:58	5:24:1	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
282	5:25:9	5:25:11	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
283	5:25:44	5:25:46	and then 
284	5:25:52	5:25:55	and there a plane crash 
285	5:29:14	5:29:20	so IY go three inch straight 
286	5:29:23	5:29:26	three inch 
287	5:31:29	5:31:30	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
288	5:31:41	5:31:45	so 
289	5:32:0	5:32:6	what 
290	5:33:22	5:33:23	after IY slope down IY say 
292	5:34:49	5:34:56	slight 
294	5:37:21	5:37:26	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
295	5:38:31	5:38:38	IY go straight down 
297	5:43:19	5:43:19	ok 
301	5:47:46	5:47:55	no IY have 
302	5:47:55	5:47:58	IY slope down again 
303	5:48:2	5:48:2	then 
304	5:48:18	5:48:26	uhm 
305	5:48:34	5:48:37	uhm 
306	5:48:42	5:48:46	that little slope 
307	5:49:25	5:49:28	have a s 
308	5:49:36	5:49:42	and then 
309	5:52:7	5:52:7	IY actually start like right 
311	5:57:4	5:57:12	uhm 
313	5:58:43	5:58:47	ok 
314	6:0:0	6:0:8	couple inch IY slope down 
315	6:0:43	6:0:46	well 
316	6:1:3	6:1:12	yes 
317	6:1:50	6:1:59	alright be IY start near the 
319	6:2:58	6:3:1	and then 
321	6:4:30	6:4:30	no 
323	6:7:20	6:7:25	well alright 
325	6:8:33	6:8:38	IY slope 
327	6:11:39	6:11:46	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
328	6:12:44	6:12:46	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
329	6:12:47	6:12:54	ok plane crash isn there 
331	6:14:43	6:14:47	there a there 
332	6:15:25	6:15:28	to the right 
336	6:18:57	6:19:1	like 
337	6:19:16	6:19:20	for like 
338	6:21:8	6:21:14	to the leave 
340	6:26:50	6:26:55	uhhh no 
341	6:27:22	6:27:23	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
342	6:28:34	6:28:36	maybe 
start f
3	0:2:41	0:2:49	no IY go with hot spring IY have 
9	0:8:11	0:8:18	mm Hmm 
12	0:12:7	0:12:10	ok 
15	0:13:35	0:13:37	ok

30	0:34:9	0:34:9	how many inch do IY think 
34	0:42:33	0:42:42	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
38	0:45:28	0:45:31	IY a plane crash though 
43	0:48:48	0:48:55	to the leave of the antelope 
51	0:57:39	0:57:40	IY hit some round rock 
54	0:59:12	0:59:19	IY have to back up a little bit 
57	1:1:31	1:1:37	IY start yeah the stony desert 
61	1:4:46	1:4:49	ok 
62	1:6:47	1:6:48	ok 
64	1:7:23	1:7:25	and then what

73	1:23:29	1:23:38	ok 
76	1:26:12	1:26:19	IY three inch above the savannah 
82	1:30:12	1:30:12	and to the right 
87	1:32:32	1:32:35	and curve down to the leave 
90	1:35:25	1:35:32	IY know IY have different thing so 
91	1:38:35	1:38:40	nope IY have a white mountain

126	2:23:24	2:23:31	IY hit some rock though 
127	2:23:34	2:23:39	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash 
138	2:45:59	2:46:3	yeah 
139	2:50:46	2:50:47	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right

177	3:25:28	3:25:35	and there a collapse shelter 
181	3:32:58	3:33:0	plane crash be on the other side but IY just ok 
184	3:39:34	3:39:37	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
185	3:44:35	3:44:39	and 
191	3:49:46	3:49:49	plane crash IY don think be yeah 
192	3:49:50	3:49:53	yeah 
196	3:57:44	3:57:52	around the lake to the top 
200	3:59:48	3:59:49	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
203	4:4:19	4:4:28	do IY hit anything when IY go down

231	4:32:2	4:32:6	ok 
233	4:33:21	4:33:29	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
236	4:35:17	4:35:20	around the top of the lake 
247	4:46:18	4:46:24	mm Hmm 
248	4:46:56	4:46:57	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
249	4:47:44	4:47:47	mm Hmm

255	4:56:32	4:56:35	ok 
256	4:58:25	4:58:29	ok 
261	5:4:53	5:5:1	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
262	5:6:54	5:6:54	yeah 
263	5:7:51	5:7:51	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
267	5:10:10	5:10:18	up tp the right 
274	5:16:12	5:16:14	to the right 
277	5:19:20	5:19:24	oh 
291	5:33:21	5:33:30	yeah 
293	5:35:27	5:35:34	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
296	5:40:33	5:40:38	ok 
298	5:44:49	5:44:49	uhm 
299	5:44:57	5:45:6	mm mm 
300	5:46:47	5:46:52	yeah IY see 
310	5:53:47	5:53:51	IY plane crash IY be talk about earlier that up there 
312	5:57:38	5:57:43	IY go to a lake 
318	6:2:49	6:2:49	do IY go by the plane crash 
320	6:3:9	6:3:15	to the leave 
322	6:5:13	6:5:19	yep 
324	6:8:10	6:8:12	ok 
326	6:11:7	6:11:10	mm Hmm 
330	6:14:23	6:14:32	but that like five six inch from where IY be now

334	6:16:12	6:16:18	ok 
335	6:16:16	6:16:25	so wait 
339	6:22:51	6:22:51	nope 
start g
0	0:0:2	0:0:4	no IY don have any rock 
1	0:2:19	0:2:19	ok IY at the savannah 
2	0:2:46	0:2:46	IY kind of go 
4	0:2:49	0:2:52	and then IY come to a savannah 
5	0:3:48	0:3:57	like 
6	0:4:14	0:4:22	three inch straight across 
7	0:4:42	0:4:48	and IY just go straight up 
8	0:4:44	0:4:52	ok 
10	0:8:41	0:8:43	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
11	0:12:4	0:12:6	ok 
13	0:12:26	0:12:28	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
14	0:13:24	0:13:30	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
16	0:16:5	0:16:8	after plane crash 
17	0:16:39	0:16:39	right next to circle should be roman bath 
18	0:18:52	0:18:52	ok 
21	0:24:19	0:24:27	IY start 
22	0:25:37	0:25:44	like an inch 
24	0:27:21	0:27:26	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
25	0:30:9	0:30:15	and 
28	0:31:22	0:31:27	uhm 
29	0:32:48	0:32:52	alright alright well just 
31	0:35:32	0:35:33	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
32	0:38:0	0:38:8	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
33	0:39:46	0:39:53	for like 
35	0:42:51	0:42:57	so that about IY would say 
36	0:43:36	0:43:44	IY at the plane crash 
37	0:43:56	0:44:1	ok 
39	0:47:9	0:47:16	uhm 
40	0:47:43	0:47:47	not right at the stony desert 
41	0:47:46	0:47:47	IY have a waterhole on map 
42	0:48:36	0:48:40	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
44	0:50:30	0:50:36	ok 
45	0:52:21	0:52:26	uhm 
46	0:54:39	0:54:42	now IY at the collapse shelter 
47	0:54:39	0:54:46	ok well 
48	0:55:59	0:56:5	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
49	0:56:16	0:56:19	after IY go straight again 
50	0:57:28	0:57:29	well just 
52	0:58:0	0:58:0	what 
53	0:58:25	0:58:31	and IY go 
55	1:0:23	1:0:28	no IY don have a waterhole 
56	1:0:38	1:0:42	and 
58	1:2:2	1:2:7	so anyway 
59	1:3:14	1:3:19	and IY should have a straight line there 
60	1:4:15	1:4:16	away about like four inch four or five inch 
63	1:7:3	1:7:12	and then IY slope down to the leave 
65	1:8:24	1:8:28	and then IY go down 
66	1:12:49	1:12:56	ok 
68	1:17:58	1:17:58	three inch 
69	1:17:51	1:17:59	and 
71	1:21:23	1:21:31	they there 
72	1:22:51	1:22:57	on sheet anyway 
74	1:24:4	1:24:4	and be to the leave 
75	1:25:40	1:25:47	be IY in like 
77	1:26:15	1:26:19	IY 
78	1:27:21	1:27:26	to the leave 
79	1:27:21	1:27:29	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
80	1:28:1	1:28:5	the 
81	1:29:52	1:29:56	to the white mountain 
83	1:31:6	1:31:10	do IY have roman bath 
84	1:31:33	1:31:35	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
85	1:31:42	1:31:47	and 
86	1:32:27	1:32:31	and that where the plane crash be 
88	1:33:35	1:33:38	ok 
89	1:34:3	1:34:8	ok 
92	1:38:57	1:38:57	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
93	1:40:59	1:41:1	ok 
94	1:41:18	1:41:23	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
95	1:42:55	1:42:56	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
97	1:43:55	1:44:1	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
98	1:43:55	1:44:3	uhm IY straighten out slope 
99	1:45:27	1:45:31	ok 
100	1:47:23	1:47:29	be IY 
101	1:49:4	1:49:5	and then 
103	1:55:25	1:55:29	a little 
104	1:55:29	1:55:34	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
105	1:55:45	1:55:48	like maybe an inch 
106	1:56:11	1:56:18	and then IY go straight 
107	1:57:44	1:57:51	IY make 
108	1:59:9	1:59:18	a little bit too 
109	2:0:11	2:0:17	like IY slope 
111	2:0:37	2:0:45	and it slope a little bit to the right 
112	2:2:37	2:2:45	maybe like 
113	2:3:2	2:3:5	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
114	2:3:58	2:4:6	ok 
116	2:5:48	2:5:48	and IY go up like 
117	2:11:24	2:11:26	and then IY you go up 
118	2:12:12	2:12:14	uh like 
120	2:15:10	2:15:18	an inch maybe a little bit less 
121	2:15:26	2:15:28	but 
123	2:18:8	2:18:13	a quarter of an inch 
128	2:23:51	2:23:56	to the lake 
129	2:25:4	2:25:6	ok 
130	2:26:53	2:27:1	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
131	2:28:29	2:28:32	uhm 
132	2:31:6	2:31:14	uhm 
133	2:32:21	2:32:24	to the leave of little path where path should be 
134	2:38:26	2:38:31	just a slight slope 
135	2:39:23	2:39:23	and then 
136	2:41:7	2:41:16	like 
137	2:42:49	2:42:56	ok 
142	2:55:1	2:55:9	ok

152	3:2:55	3:2:55	maybe like 
153	3:2:54	3:2:58	uhm and there be a stony desert 
156	3:4:40	3:4:47	IY go about 
157	3:6:53	3:7:1	IY just go down 
159	3:9:18	3:9:25	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
160	3:10:30	3:10:39	five 
162	3:12:59	3:13:4	yes IY go towards the lake 
163	3:13:46	3:13:51	couple mile or something 
164	3:13:51	3:13:53	after the circle 
166	3:14:3	3:14:5	and then IY slope up 
167	3:14:10	3:14:12	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
168	3:14:31	3:14:37	that about five or six inch 
169	3:14:34	3:14:43	IY wanna kind of curve 
170	3:17:37	3:17:46	like four or five inch to the leave 
171	3:19:17	3:19:23	go up like three three and a half inch 
172	3:19:47	3:19:47	uhm

182	3:37:11	3:37:11	be IY anywere near there 
183	3:38:56	3:39:4	plane crash 
186	3:45:8	3:45:14	be IY anywhere near there 
187	3:46:27	3:46:28	ok 
188	3:47:23	3:47:23	so IY at the hot spring 
189	3:48:6	3:48:8	alright well IY keep go and see 
190	3:48:46	3:48:47	be IY in like almost the top of the 
193	3:50:29	3:50:30	ok

198	3:58:51	3:58:51	ok 
199	3:59:41	3:59:47	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
201	4:2:2	4:2:7	where IY go down to a plane crash 
202	4:2:32	4:2:36	it not a big curve 
204	4:4:22	4:4:31	IY start at the stony desert 
205	4:5:52	4:5:57	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
207	4:7:29	4:7:30	to the leave 
208	4:8:7	4:8:16	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
209	4:11:18	4:11:20	and then IY slope 
210	4:12:19	4:12:27	maybe four inch on the paper 
211	4:12:30	4:12:38	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
212	4:13:19	4:13:19	and then IY be 
213	4:13:28	4:13:31	be the plane crash 
215	4:14:41	4:14:43	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
216	4:14:52	4:14:55	ok 
217	4:15:28	4:15:29	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
218	4:15:41	4:15:41	to right 
219	4:17:12	4:17:15	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
220	4:17:35	4:17:44	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
222	4:19:2	4:19:8	IY go like 
223	4:20:46	4:20:54	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
225	4:27:11	4:27:12	and then 
227	4:28:23	4:28:23	uhm 
228	4:30:18	4:30:18	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
229	4:31:18	4:31:21	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
230	4:31:56	4:32:5	and then 
232	4:33:1	4:33:10	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
234	4:33:36	4:33:38	just do it like this ok 
235	4:34:35	4:34:37	IY just kind of slope down 
237	4:35:29	4:35:35	ok 
238	4:35:29	4:35:36	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
239	4:36:0	4:36:0	probably the same thing 
240	4:37:38	4:37:40	uhm 
241	4:40:22	4:40:25	IY move to the leave 
242	4:41:35	4:41:43	and then IY go 
243	4:42:1	4:42:8	maybe IY have different thing 
244	4:43:35	4:43:40	kind of across from stony desert 
245	4:45:9	4:45:10	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
246	4:46:22	4:46:22	ok 
250	4:47:44	4:47:53	and IY slope to the leave 
251	4:50:36	4:50:44	and then 
253	4:53:49	4:53:50	uhm 
254	4:54:1	4:54:10	the slate mountain be towards the right 
257	4:58:28	4:58:32	and IY go straight up 
258	4:58:55	4:59:3	ok 
259	4:59:13	4:59:16	around the bottom of it 
260	5:2:44	5:2:51	yes 
264	5:7:57	5:8:2	from 
265	5:9:7	5:9:10	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
266	5:10:10	5:10:15	no 
268	5:10:16	5:10:20	so IY make circle 
269	5:12:38	5:12:39	uhm 
270	5:12:39	5:12:41	ok 
271	5:14:56	5:15:1	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
272	5:15:10	5:15:18	ok and then IY go 
273	5:15:11	5:15:20	IY would say 
275	5:18:19	5:18:21	IY get 
276	5:18:43	5:18:47	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
278	5:19:50	5:19:52	uhm 
279	5:20:50	5:20:50	like 
280	5:20:46	5:20:51	for about two inch 
281	5:23:58	5:24:1	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
282	5:25:9	5:25:11	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
283	5:25:44	5:25:46	and then 
284	5:25:52	5:25:55	and there a plane crash 
285	5:29:14	5:29:20	so IY go three inch straight 
286	5:29:23	5:29:26	three inch 
287	5:31:29	5:31:30	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
288	5:31:41	5:31:45	so 
289	5:32:0	5:32:6	what 
290	5:33:22	5:33:23	after IY slope down IY say 
292	5:34:49	5:34:56	slight 
294	5:37:21	5:37:26	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
295	5:38:31	5:38:38	IY go straight down 
297	5:43:19	5:43:19	ok 
301	5:47:46	5:47:55	no IY have 
302	5:47:55	5:47:58	IY slope down again 
303	5:48:2	5:48:2	then 
304	5:48:18	5:48:26	uhm 
305	5:48:34	5:48:37	uhm 
306	5:48:42	5:48:46	that little slope 
307	5:49:25	5:49:28	have a s 
308	5:49:36	5:49:42	and then 
309	5:52:7	5:52:7	IY actually start like right 
311	5:57:4	5:57:12	uhm 
313	5:58:43	5:58:47	ok 
314	6:0:0	6:0:8	couple inch IY slope down 
315	6:0:43	6:0:46	well 
316	6:1:3	6:1:12	yes 
317	6:1:50	6:1:59	alright be IY start near the
