start
start g
0	0:2:39	0:2:41	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
1	0:6:46	0:6:47	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
2	0:7:22	0:7:23	ok 
3	0:8:34	0:8:43	ok well 
4	0:9:37	0:9:45	then

8	0:16:54	0:17:3	a little 
9	0:18:39	0:18:45	and then IY go down 
10	0:19:3	0:19:9	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
11	0:19:38	0:19:42	uhm IY straighten out slope 
12	0:20:35	0:20:37	ok 
13	0:26:11	0:26:15	and then IY you go up 
14	0:27:21	0:27:22	IY go about 
15	0:29:12	0:29:15	like an inch 
16	0:29:27	0:29:31	ok 
17	0:31:45	0:31:52	for like 
21	0:33:34	0:33:41	yes 
23	0:33:44	0:33:52	and IY go up like 
24	0:35:50	0:35:57	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
26	0:37:51	0:37:54	uhm 
29	0:41:55	0:41:56	but 
33	0:47:14	0:47:15	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
34	0:47:26	0:47:29	they there 
36	0:48:41	0:48:48	and then IY slope down to the leave 
38	0:49:35	0:49:40	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
40	0:52:55	0:52:59	uhm and there be a stony desert 
41	0:52:51	0:53:0	IY 
42	0:53:6	0:53:15	so IY make circle 
43	0:55:42	0:55:45	do IY have roman bath 
45	0:56:34	0:56:40	about like 
46	0:57:14	0:57:16	IY slope 
47	0:57:45	0:57:51	so IY go three inch straight 
48	0:58:35	0:58:43	alright 
50	1:0:0	1:0:0	uhm 
51	1:0:56	1:1:1	IY don know 
52	1:3:5	1:3:14	like 
53	1:4:3	1:4:6	and then 
55	1:4:57	1:5:3	and then 
58	1:11:59	1:12:2	ok 
59	1:12:29	1:12:37	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
60	1:14:4	1:14:7	be IY anywere near there 
61	1:15:0	1:15:5	and it slope a little bit to the right 
62	1:14:57	1:15:6	ok 
65	1:22:46	1:22:47	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
66	1:22:56	1:23:3	be the plane crash 
67	1:24:1	1:24:8	ok 
68	1:24:7	1:24:11	there a there 
69	1:25:10	1:25:11	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
70	1:26:1	1:26:8	maybe 
72	1:27:1	1:27:4	ok 
73	1:27:7	1:27:16	just do it like this ok 
74	1:28:16	1:28:18	a little bit too 
77	1:32:28	1:32:32	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
78	1:33:21	1:33:21	and then IY slope up 
79	1:33:50	1:33:56	no IY have 
81	1:38:5	1:38:7	IY just kind of slope down 
82	1:38:52	1:38:59	IY at the plane crash 
85	1:44:19	1:44:20	like four or five inch to the leave 
86	1:48:0	1:48:1	now IY at the collapse shelter 
87	1:48:24	1:48:32	and slope be about an inch long 
88	1:50:36	1:50:39	and 
91	1:52:35	1:52:42	be IY anywhere near there 
92	1:53:36	1:53:37	uhm 
93	1:55:3	1:55:8	and that where the plane crash be 
94	1:56:18	1:56:26	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
95	1:58:17	1:58:26	no IY don have any rock 
96	2:0:25	2:0:28	uhm 
100	2:8:14	2:8:19	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
101	2:8:42	2:8:44	IY slope down again 
103	2:10:33	2:10:34	three inch straight across 
104	2:12:11	2:12:17	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
105	2:12:49	2:12:55	uhm 
106	2:12:58	2:13:5	just a slight slope 
112	2:16:54	2:17:0	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
113	2:17:15	2:17:22	IY move to the leave 
114	2:17:31	2:17:35	to the white mountain 
115	2:19:16	2:19:17	uhm 
116	2:19:22	2:19:25	after the circle 
117	2:19:48	2:19:49	ok 
118	2:21:6	2:21:6	on sheet anyway 
119	2:22:35	2:22:35	no 
120	2:23:5	2:23:12	IY kind of go 
121	2:24:4	2:24:9	and then

123	2:24:55	2:24:59	and then 
124	2:26:25	2:26:26	a quarter of an inch 
125	2:26:55	2:26:56	and then IY slope 
126	2:30:17	2:30:21	IY start at the stony desert 
127	2:34:46	2:34:55	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
129	2:35:7	2:35:15	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
130	2:36:41	2:36:49	and IY go straight up 
131	2:37:24	2:37:28	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
132	2:39:33	2:39:34	alright alright well just 
134	2:42:23	2:42:25	ok 
136	2:45:32	2:45:41	no 
137	2:48:36	2:48:45	IY start 
139	2:49:46	2:49:46	uhm

143	2:53:18	2:53:25	ok 
145	2:55:18	2:55:19	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
147	2:55:49	2:55:51	ok 
148	2:55:55	2:55:56	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
149	2:57:37	2:57:40	what 
151	2:59:10	2:59:16	ok and then IY go 
152	2:59:24	2:59:30	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
153	2:59:36	2:59:41	ok 
154	2:59:45	2:59:54	like three inch 
155	3:0:23	3:0:28	kind of across from stony desert 
157	3:1:3	3:1:7	and then 
158	3:2:24	3:2:27	to the leave of little path where path should be 
159	3:3:57	3:4:0	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
160	3:5:27	3:5:29	like 
161	3:5:42	3:5:44	ok 
163	3:6:56	3:7:2	uhm 
164	3:7:4	3:7:5	it not a big curve 
165	3:8:37	3:8:41	uhm 
167	3:9:59	3:10:0	after IY go straight again 
168	3:13:1	3:13:3	go up like three three and a half inch 
171	3:19:5	3:19:12	ok 
172	3:19:56	3:20:5	after IY slope down IY say 
173	3:20:27	3:20:32	uhm 
174	3:20:51	3:20:56	and IY just go straight up 
175	3:22:50	3:22:52	five 
177	3:25:19	3:25:23	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
178	3:26:8	3:26:15	uhm 
179	3:26:54	3:26:57	maybe like 
180	3:27:38	3:27:43	IY would say 
181	3:30:56	3:31:2	well 
182	3:30:56	3:31:5	uhhh no 
183	3:31:21	3:31:23	IY get 
185	3:33:46	3:33:52	ok 
186	3:33:45	3:33:52	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
187	3:34:25	3:34:34	so that about IY would say 
188	3:35:18	3:35:26	that about five or six inch 
189	3:36:36	3:36:45	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
190	3:36:58	3:37:7	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
191	3:38:46	3:38:50	be IY 
192	3:40:27	3:40:27	no IY don have a waterhole 
193	3:42:19	3:42:19	IY go like 
194	3:43:26	3:43:26	and then IY be 
195	3:43:33	3:43:38	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
197	3:44:6	3:44:6	ok 
200	3:46:55	3:47:3	maybe IY have different thing 
201	3:47:31	3:47:36	to the right 
202	3:49:24	3:49:26	that little slope 
203	3:50:37	3:50:46	and IY slope to the leave 
204	3:52:27	3:52:31	IY actually start like right 
205	3:54:15	3:54:15	plane crash 
206	3:54:40	3:54:40	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
207	3:58:16	3:58:23	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
209	3:58:50	3:58:53	not right at the stony desert 
210	3:59:16	3:59:24	uh like 
211	4:2:21	4:2:21	and then 
212	4:2:22	4:2:30	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
213	4:2:37	4:2:40	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
214	4:3:16	4:3:20	ok well 
217	4:5:44	4:5:49	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
218	4:5:56	4:5:57	alright 
219	4:6:54	4:6:56	yes IY go towards the lake 
220	4:6:55	4:6:58	to the leave 
223	4:9:32	4:9:39	and then 
225	4:15:6	4:15:7	uhm 
226	4:16:41	4:16:45	no there no elephant 
229	4:18:38	4:18:40	and then IY go 
230	4:18:46	4:18:51	ok 
231	4:22:7	4:22:13	three inch 
232	4:22:47	4:22:52	after plane crash 
233	4:25:16	4:25:18	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
236	4:27:44	4:27:46	straight up 
241	4:31:36	4:31:43	the 
242	4:33:56	4:34:3	and IY go 
243	4:34:48	4:34:55	and 
244	4:36:16	4:36:16	well alright 
245	4:37:1	4:37:4	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
246	4:38:31	4:38:39	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
247	4:39:26	4:39:27	IY make 
248	4:40:42	4:40:50	IY just go down 
249	4:42:31	4:42:32	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
250	4:44:54	4:45:3	from 
251	4:45:37	4:45:41	Hmm 
252	4:45:51	4:45:53	IY wanna kind of curve 
253	4:46:33	4:46:36	and 
254	4:46:48	4:46:50	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
255	4:49:39	4:49:42	like 
256	4:50:25	4:50:31	ok 
258	4:51:33	4:51:33	ok plane crash isn there 
259	4:53:0	4:53:5	and then 
262	4:55:7	4:55:7	have a s 
266	4:58:26	4:58:30	like 
267	4:59:13	4:59:19	to right 
268	5:0:30	5:0:39	probably the same thing 
269	5:4:20	5:4:24	uhm 
270	5:4:25	5:4:34	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
271	5:4:48	5:4:57	and then IY go straight 
272	5:6:16	5:6:23	and IY should have a straight line there 
273	5:9:30	5:9:34	right next to circle should be roman bath 
274	5:9:42	5:9:44	well just 
275	5:11:58	5:11:59	three inch 
276	5:12:25	5:12:29	alright well IY keep go and see 
278	5:13:47	5:13:50	what 
280	5:15:35	5:15:44	to the leave 
282	5:17:21	5:17:27	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
283	5:17:44	5:17:51	uhm 
286	5:20:37	5:20:42	and 
287	5:22:57	5:23:4	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
288	5:23:7	5:23:9	ok IY at the savannah 
289	5:23:12	5:23:16	so 
290	5:24:20	5:24:22	ok 
291	5:25:35	5:25:38	for like 
292	5:26:9	5:26:10	maybe four inch on the paper 
293	5:26:56	5:27:2	like IY slope 
295	5:30:45	5:30:53	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
296	5:34:38	5:34:43	ok 
297	5:34:54	5:35:3	ok 
298	5:36:29	5:36:30	four or five inch to the leave 
299	5:38:18	5:38:21	couple inch IY slope down 
300	5:39:1	5:39:6	be IY in like 
301	5:39:9	5:39:9	away about like four inch four or five inch 
302	5:39:33	5:39:39	yes 
304	5:41:5	5:41:12	where IY go down to a plane crash 
305	5:42:21	5:42:27	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
306	5:42:42	5:42:44	ok 
309	5:46:29	5:46:37	well 
310	5:47:44	5:47:53	the slate mountain be towards the right 
311	5:48:1	5:48:1	to the lake 
313	5:48:42	5:48:51	ok 
314	5:51:37	5:51:39	like maybe an inch 
315	5:51:45	5:51:54	couple mile or something 
317	5:55:34	5:55:41	IY go straight down 
318	5:58:32	5:58:32	so anyway 
319	5:59:14	5:59:19	IY have a waterhole on map 
320	6:0:10	6:0:18	and be to the leave 
321	6:0:47	6:0:52	an inch maybe a little bit less 
323	6:1:6	6:1:13	and there a plane crash 
324	6:1:14	6:1:22	alright be IY start near the 
325	6:1:43	6:1:52	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
326	6:3:44	6:3:47	to the leave 
327	6:4:23	6:4:27	ok 
328	6:6:29	6:6:36	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
329	6:7:1	6:7:3	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
331	6:7:33	6:7:41	around the bottom of it 
333	6:8:40	6:8:44	so IY at the hot spring 
334	6:11:1	6:11:5	be IY in like almost the top of the 
337	6:22:42	6:22:42	uhm 
339	6:23:0	6:23:6	and then IY come to a savannah 
340	6:24:8	6:24:16	for about two inch 
341	6:24:48	6:24:54	uhm 
start f
18	0:31:58	0:32:6	but that like five six inch from where IY be now 
19	0:32:43	0:32:47	ok 
20	0:33:34	0:33:35	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
22	0:33:46	0:33:47	mm Hmm 
25	0:36:34	0:36:40	ok 
27	0:40:49	0:40:56	yeah

32	0:44:40	0:44:46	ok 
35	0:47:42	0:47:45	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
37	0:48:42	0:48:48	ok 
39	0:50:40	0:50:45	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash 
44	0:55:50	0:55:57	yeah 
49	0:58:55	0:58:56	yeah 
54	1:4:22	1:4:22	yeah IY see

71	1:26:51	1:26:54	ok 
75	1:30:46	1:30:51	elephant 
76	1:31:54	1:31:57	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
80	1:37:48	1:37:57	yeah 
83	1:42:3	1:42:4	mm Hmm 
84	1:43:59	1:44:3	ok 
89	1:51:25	1:51:34	ok 
90	1:51:51	1:51:51	IY at the savannah 
97	2:1:24	2:1:26	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
98	2:3:17	2:3:20	it not like in the same place IY describe 
99	2:4:17	2:4:22	ok 
102	2:9:17	2:9:20	ok 
107	2:14:33	2:14:42	around the lake to the top 
108	2:14:39	2:14:48	nope IY have a white mountain 
109	2:14:51	2:14:56	no IY go with hot spring IY have 
110	2:16:25	2:16:26	mm mm 
111	2:16:38	2:16:45	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
128	2:34:53	2:34:58	yep 
133	2:40:58	2:41:0	nope

234	4:25:47	4:25:54	plane crash be on the other side but IY just ok 
235	4:27:7	4:27:7	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
237	4:28:16	4:28:16	yeah

285	5:19:55	5:19:55	and there a collapse shelter 
294	5:29:55	5:29:58	IY plane crash IY be talk about earlier that up there 
303	5:39:40	5:39:45	up tp the right 
307	5:44:22	5:44:29	ok 
308	5:45:6	5:45:6	IY start yeah the stony desert 
312	5:48:35	5:48:44	yeah 
316	5:52:35	5:52:42	ok 
322	6:1:2	6:1:2	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
330	6:7:22	6:7:22	IY a plane crash though 
332	6:7:53	6:7:57	and to the right 
335	6:13:19	6:13:28	do IY go by the plane crash 
336	6:17:43	6:17:44	and then what 
338	6:22:40	6:22:47	IY go to a lake 
342	6:25:6	6:25:8	IY three inch above the savannah 
start g
0	0:2:39	0:2:41	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
1	0:6:46	0:6:47	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
2	0:7:22	0:7:23	ok 
3	0:8:34	0:8:43	ok well 
4	0:9:37	0:9:45	then

9	0:18:39	0:18:45	and then IY go down 
10	0:19:3	0:19:9	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
11	0:19:38	0:19:42	uhm IY straighten out slope 
12	0:20:35	0:20:37	ok 
13	0:26:11	0:26:15	and then IY you go up 
14	0:27:21	0:27:22	IY go about

36	0:48:41	0:48:48	and then IY slope down to the leave 
38	0:49:35	0:49:40	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
40	0:52:55	0:52:59	uhm and there be a stony desert 
41	0:52:51	0:53:0	IY 
42	0:53:6	0:53:15	so IY make circle 
43	0:55:42	0:55:45	do IY have roman bath 
45	0:56:34	0:56:40	about like 
46	0:57:14	0:57:16	IY slope 
47	0:57:45	0:57:51	so IY go three inch straight 
48	0:58:35	0:58:43	alright 
50	1:0:0	1:0:0	uhm 
51	1:0:56	1:1:1	IY don know

58	1:11:59	1:12:2	ok 
59	1:12:29	1:12:37	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
60	1:14:4	1:14:7	be IY anywere near there 
61	1:15:0	1:15:5	and it slope a little bit to the right 
62	1:14:57	1:15:6	ok 
65	1:22:46	1:22:47	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
66	1:22:56	1:23:3	be the plane crash 
67	1:24:1	1:24:8	ok 
68	1:24:7	1:24:11	there a there 
69	1:25:10	1:25:11	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
70	1:26:1	1:26:8	maybe 
72	1:27:1	1:27:4	ok 
73	1:27:7	1:27:16	just do it like this ok 
74	1:28:16	1:28:18	a little bit too 
77	1:32:28	1:32:32	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
78	1:33:21	1:33:21	and then IY slope up 
79	1:33:50	1:33:56	no IY have 
81	1:38:5	1:38:7	IY just kind of slope down 
82	1:38:52	1:38:59	IY at the plane crash 
85	1:44:19	1:44:20	like four or five inch to the leave 
86	1:48:0	1:48:1	now IY at the collapse shelter 
87	1:48:24	1:48:32	and slope be about an inch long 
88	1:50:36	1:50:39	and 
91	1:52:35	1:52:42	be IY anywhere near there 
92	1:53:36	1:53:37	uhm 
93	1:55:3	1:55:8	and that where the plane crash be 
94	1:56:18	1:56:26	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
95	1:58:17	1:58:26	no IY don have any rock 
96	2:0:25	2:0:28	uhm 
100	2:8:14	2:8:19	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
101	2:8:42	2:8:44	IY slope down again 
103	2:10:33	2:10:34	three inch straight across 
104	2:12:11	2:12:17	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
105	2:12:49	2:12:55	uhm 
106	2:12:58	2:13:5	just a slight slope 
112	2:16:54	2:17:0	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
113	2:17:15	2:17:22	IY move to the leave 
114	2:17:31	2:17:35	to the white mountain 
115	2:19:16	2:19:17	uhm 
116	2:19:22	2:19:25	after the circle 
117	2:19:48	2:19:49	ok 
118	2:21:6	2:21:6	on sheet anyway 
119	2:22:35	2:22:35	no 
120	2:23:5	2:23:12	IY kind of go 
121	2:24:4	2:24:9	and then

123	2:24:55	2:24:59	and then 
124	2:26:25	2:26:26	a quarter of an inch 
125	2:26:55	2:26:56	and then IY slope 
126	2:30:17	2:30:21	IY start at the stony desert 
127	2:34:46	2:34:55	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
129	2:35:7	2:35:15	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
130	2:36:41	2:36:49	and IY go straight up 
131	2:37:24	2:37:28	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
132	2:39:33	2:39:34	alright alright well just 
134	2:42:23	2:42:25	ok 
136	2:45:32	2:45:41	no

147	2:55:49	2:55:51	ok 
148	2:55:55	2:55:56	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
149	2:57:37	2:57:40	what 
151	2:59:10	2:59:16	ok and then IY go 
152	2:59:24	2:59:30	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
153	2:59:36	2:59:41	ok 
154	2:59:45	2:59:54	like three inch 
155	3:0:23	3:0:28	kind of across from stony desert 
157	3:1:3	3:1:7	and then 
158	3:2:24	3:2:27	to the leave of little path where path should be 
159	3:3:57	3:4:0	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
160	3:5:27	3:5:29	like 
161	3:5:42	3:5:44	ok 
163	3:6:56	3:7:2	uhm 
164	3:7:4	3:7:5	it not a big curve 
165	3:8:37	3:8:41	uhm 
167	3:9:59	3:10:0	after IY go straight again 
168	3:13:1	3:13:3	go up like three three and a half inch 
171	3:19:5	3:19:12	ok 
172	3:19:56	3:20:5	after IY slope down IY say 
173	3:20:27	3:20:32	uhm 
174	3:20:51	3:20:56	and IY just go straight up 
175	3:22:50	3:22:52	five 
177	3:25:19	3:25:23	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
178	3:26:8	3:26:15	uhm 
179	3:26:54	3:26:57	maybe like 
180	3:27:38	3:27:43	IY would say

185	3:33:46	3:33:52	ok 
186	3:33:45	3:33:52	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
187	3:34:25	3:34:34	so that about IY would say 
188	3:35:18	3:35:26	that about five or six inch 
189	3:36:36	3:36:45	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
190	3:36:58	3:37:7	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
191	3:38:46	3:38:50	be IY 
192	3:40:27	3:40:27	no IY don have a waterhole 
193	3:42:19	3:42:19	IY go like 
194	3:43:26	3:43:26	and then IY be 
195	3:43:33	3:43:38	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
197	3:44:6	3:44:6	ok 
200	3:46:55	3:47:3	maybe IY have different thing 
201	3:47:31	3:47:36	to the right 
202	3:49:24	3:49:26	that little slope 
203	3:50:37	3:50:46	and IY slope to the leave 
204	3:52:27	3:52:31	IY actually start like right 
205	3:54:15	3:54:15	plane crash 
206	3:54:40	3:54:40	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
207	3:58:16	3:58:23	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
209	3:58:50	3:58:53	not right at the stony desert 
210	3:59:16	3:59:24	uh like 
211	4:2:21	4:2:21	and then 
212	4:2:22	4:2:30	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
213	4:2:37	4:2:40	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
214	4:3:16	4:3:20	ok well 
217	4:5:44	4:5:49	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything

230	4:18:46	4:18:51	ok 
231	4:22:7	4:22:13	three inch 
232	4:22:47	4:22:52	after plane crash 
233	4:25:16	4:25:18	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
236	4:27:44	4:27:46	straight up 
241	4:31:36	4:31:43	the 
242	4:33:56	4:34:3	and IY go

244	4:36:16	4:36:16	well alright 
245	4:37:1	4:37:4	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
246	4:38:31	4:38:39	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
247	4:39:26	4:39:27	IY make 
248	4:40:42	4:40:50	IY just go down 
249	4:42:31	4:42:32	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
250	4:44:54	4:45:3	from 
251	4:45:37	4:45:41	Hmm 
252	4:45:51	4:45:53	IY wanna kind of curve 
253	4:46:33	4:46:36	and 
254	4:46:48	4:46:50	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
255	4:49:39	4:49:42	like 
256	4:50:25	4:50:31	ok 
258	4:51:33	4:51:33	ok plane crash isn there 
259	4:53:0	4:53:5	and then 
262	4:55:7	4:55:7	have a s 
266	4:58:26	4:58:30	like 
267	4:59:13	4:59:19	to right 
268	5:0:30	5:0:39	probably the same thing 
269	5:4:20	5:4:24	uhm 
270	5:4:25	5:4:34	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
271	5:4:48	5:4:57	and then IY go straight 
272	5:6:16	5:6:23	and IY should have a straight line there 
273	5:9:30	5:9:34	right next to circle should be roman bath 
274	5:9:42	5:9:44	well just 
275	5:11:58	5:11:59	three inch 
276	5:12:25	5:12:29	alright well IY keep go and see 
278	5:13:47	5:13:50	what 
280	5:15:35	5:15:44	to the leave 
282	5:17:21	5:17:27	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
283	5:17:44	5:17:51	uhm 
286	5:20:37	5:20:42	and 
287	5:22:57	5:23:4	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
288	5:23:7	5:23:9	ok IY at the savannah 
289	5:23:12	5:23:16	so 
290	5:24:20	5:24:22	ok 
291	5:25:35	5:25:38	for like 
292	5:26:9	5:26:10	maybe four inch on the paper 
293	5:26:56	5:27:2	like IY slope 
295	5:30:45	5:30:53	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
296	5:34:38	5:34:43	ok 
297	5:34:54	5:35:3	ok 
298	5:36:29	5:36:30	four or five inch to the leave 
299	5:38:18	5:38:21	couple inch IY slope down 
300	5:39:1	5:39:6	be IY in like 
301	5:39:9	5:39:9	away about like four inch four or five inch 
302	5:39:33	5:39:39	yes 
304	5:41:5	5:41:12	where IY go down to a plane crash 
305	5:42:21	5:42:27	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
306	5:42:42	5:42:44	ok 
309	5:46:29	5:46:37	well 
310	5:47:44	5:47:53	the slate mountain be towards the right 
311	5:48:1	5:48:1	to the lake 
313	5:48:42	5:48:51	ok 
314	5:51:37	5:51:39	like maybe an inch 
315	5:51:45	5:51:54	couple mile or something 
317	5:55:34	5:55:41	IY go straight down 
318	5:58:32	5:58:32	so anyway 
319	5:59:14	5:59:19	IY have a waterhole on map
