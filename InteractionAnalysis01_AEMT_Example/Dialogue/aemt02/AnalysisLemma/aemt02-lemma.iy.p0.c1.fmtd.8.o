start
0:1:21	0:1:24	g	and then 
0:2:4	0:2:7	f	up tp the right 
0:2:47	0:2:55	f	mm Hmm 
0:3:17	0:3:24	f	and there a collapse shelter 
0:5:48	0:5:49	f	nope 
0:5:48	0:5:52	g	and IY go straight up 
0:8:55	0:9:3	g	and then 
0:9:11	0:9:18	g	ok 
0:10:57	0:11:2	g	and IY slope to the leave 
0:11:58	0:12:4	f	ok 
0:12:59	0:13:0	f	but that like five six inch from where IY be now 
0:13:5	0:13:14	f	to 
0:13:20	0:13:28	g	ok 
0:13:58	0:14:4	g	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
0:14:31	0:14:40	g	ok 
0:14:37	0:14:44	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
0:17:3	0:17:3	g	do IY have roman bath 
0:18:17	0:18:22	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
0:18:38	0:18:47	f	and 
0:18:55	0:18:59	g	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
0:18:59	0:19:8	g	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
0:19:41	0:19:42	g	alright 
0:19:51	0:19:54	g	be IY anywere near there 
0:20:1	0:20:3	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
0:20:11	0:20:12	g	and then IY go 
0:20:13	0:20:19	f	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash 
0:22:8	0:22:12	g	ok and then IY go 
0:25:16	0:25:20	g	IY slope 
0:25:58	0:26:5	g	ok 
0:26:0	0:26:7	f	to the right 
0:27:50	0:27:58	f	do IY go through anything 
0:28:13	0:28:18	g	no 
0:29:29	0:29:34	g	from 
0:29:46	0:29:47	g	IY go straight down 
0:31:3	0:31:4	g	to the lake 
0:31:28	0:31:35	g	ok IY at the savannah 
0:32:33	0:32:34	g	uhm 
0:33:20	0:33:23	f	ok wait hold on 
0:33:53	0:34:1	g	be IY anywhere near there 
0:33:58	0:34:2	g	after IY go straight again 
0:34:22	0:34:25	f	yeah 
0:36:24	0:36:24	g	away about like four inch four or five inch 
0:38:27	0:38:29	g	IY move to the leave 
0:39:48	0:39:57	g	alright alright well just 
0:40:6	0:40:14	g	and 
0:40:7	0:40:15	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
0:42:1	0:42:10	g	be the plane crash 
0:43:43	0:43:51	f	IY at the savannah 
0:44:16	0:44:25	g	uhm 
0:44:59	0:45:2	g	ok 
0:44:57	0:45:4	g	and then IY slope up 
0:51:21	0:51:25	g	ok well 
0:53:0	0:53:5	f	oh 
0:54:33	0:54:34	g	uhm 
0:56:5	0:56:7	g	and then 
0:57:28	0:57:31	g	around the bottom of it 
0:57:29	0:57:38	g	IY don know 
0:57:46	0:57:54	f	ok 
1:1:1	1:1:8	g	there a there 
1:2:37	1:2:42	g	IY slope down again 
1:4:13	1:4:21	g	and then IY you go up 
1:5:23	1:5:29	f	yeah and IY go straight up 
1:6:40	1:6:42	g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
1:6:57	1:7:6	g	well just 
1:7:34	1:7:38	g	uhm 
1:7:59	1:8:0	f	ok 
1:8:14	1:8:17	g	IY start 
1:8:37	1:8:38	f	ok 
1:9:35	1:9:35	f	ok 
1:10:20	1:10:29	g	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
1:13:10	1:13:16	g	ok 
1:14:27	1:14:31	g	three inch 
1:14:32	1:14:35	f	ok 
1:14:56	1:14:57	f	yeah 
1:16:22	1:16:27	g	IY get 
1:17:12	1:17:17	g	kind of across from stony desert 
1:18:44	1:18:44	g	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
1:20:37	1:20:40	f	ok 
1:21:7	1:21:7	g	IY wanna kind of curve 
1:21:53	1:21:56	f	yeah IY see 
1:21:54	1:22:3	g	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
1:22:2	1:22:9	g	ok 
1:22:23	1:22:23	g	like 
1:22:36	1:22:45	g	that about five or six inch 
1:22:45	1:22:50	g	slight 
1:25:55	1:26:2	g	ok 
1:27:17	1:27:24	f	mm mm 
1:27:46	1:27:46	g	to right 
1:28:5	1:28:8	g	uhm 
1:28:0	1:28:9	f	ok 
1:28:44	1:28:46	f	and to the right 
1:29:18	1:29:24	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
1:29:42	1:29:48	g	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
1:29:58	1:29:59	g	yes 
1:30:39	1:30:47	g	straight up 
1:31:32	1:31:32	f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
1:31:25	1:31:33	g	IY have a waterhole on map 
1:31:36	1:31:41	g	the 
1:32:18	1:32:27	f	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
1:33:0	1:33:1	g	like maybe an inch 
1:35:7	1:35:8	g	alright be IY start near the 
1:35:29	1:35:36	g	and slope be about an inch long 
1:36:11	1:36:13	g	ok 
1:36:37	1:36:45	g	IY go about 
1:37:30	1:37:39	g	be IY in like 
1:38:58	1:39:7	g	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
1:41:29	1:41:35	g	and then IY slope 
1:42:20	1:42:24	g	IY at the plane crash 
1:44:9	1:44:13	g	IY make 
1:44:25	1:44:28	g	uhm 
1:45:42	1:45:43	g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
1:47:27	1:47:33	g	IY just kind of slope down 
1:48:26	1:48:28	f	IY go to a lake 
1:50:16	1:50:23	g	ok 
1:53:48	1:53:55	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
1:55:7	1:55:9	g	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
1:55:46	1:55:50	g	and then 
1:55:47	1:55:52	f	ok 
1:57:14	1:57:14	f	yeah 
1:57:21	1:57:24	g	ok 
1:57:24	1:57:26	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
1:58:11	1:58:14	g	for about two inch 
1:58:42	1:58:44	g	ok 
1:59:57	1:59:59	f	it not like in the same place IY describe 
1:59:57	1:59:59	f	ok 
2:2:49	2:2:52	g	and IY just go straight up 
2:3:15	2:3:21	g	to the white mountain 
2:4:36	2:4:37	g	ok 
2:4:46	2:4:47	f	IY three inch above the savannah 
2:5:10	2:5:12	g	ok 
2:7:36	2:7:45	f	mm Hmm 
2:10:6	2:10:10	f	ok 
2:11:10	2:11:16	g	ok 
2:12:12	2:12:12	g	IY actually start like right 
2:12:25	2:12:31	g	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
2:14:10	2:14:11	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY just ok 
2:15:43	2:15:46	f	yeah 
2:17:57	2:18:2	g	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
2:20:39	2:20:39	g	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
2:20:35	2:20:41	f	ok 
2:20:57	2:21:1	f	no IY go with hot spring IY have 
2:21:47	2:21:49	g	for like 
2:22:51	2:22:55	f	how many inch do IY think 
2:22:48	2:22:56	g	after the circle 
2:23:52	2:23:52	g	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
2:24:39	2:24:48	g	ok 
2:24:49	2:24:49	g	like an inch 
2:28:11	2:28:13	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
2:28:26	2:28:30	g	alright well IY keep go and see 
2:28:35	2:28:42	g	IY kind of go 
2:29:52	2:29:56	g	uhm 
2:32:11	2:32:16	f	ok 
2:32:46	2:32:49	g	and IY go up like 
2:34:10	2:34:16	g	IY start at the stony desert 
2:35:32	2:35:35	g	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
2:36:6	2:36:9	g	well 
2:37:7	2:37:14	g	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
2:39:47	2:39:54	g	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
2:43:49	2:43:54	f	IY plane crash IY be talk about earlier that up there 
2:45:41	2:45:49	g	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
2:46:8	2:46:16	g	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
2:47:30	2:47:38	g	like 
2:48:44	2:48:45	f	mm Hmm 
2:48:40	2:48:48	g	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
2:50:48	2:50:55	f	yeah 
2:50:51	2:50:56	g	about like 
2:50:58	2:51:1	g	yes 
2:51:32	2:51:36	f	yeah 
2:52:52	2:52:55	g	what 
2:53:43	2:53:46	g	ok 
2:54:33	2:54:40	g	so IY at the hot spring 
2:54:55	2:54:58	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
2:55:46	2:55:47	g	just do it like this ok 
2:56:40	2:56:41	g	so that about IY would say 
2:56:47	2:56:49	f	yep 
2:58:34	2:58:38	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
3:2:48	3:2:53	g	like four or five inch to the leave 
3:8:40	3:8:43	f	ok 
3:9:33	3:9:42	g	IY go like 
3:9:52	3:9:53	g	for like 
3:15:5	3:15:13	f	ok 
3:15:55	3:15:57	g	like three inch 
3:16:56	3:17:3	g	uhm 
3:18:11	3:18:18	g	uhhh no 
3:18:54	3:19:1	g	it not a big curve 
3:19:36	3:19:39	f	IY start yeah the stony desert 
3:20:23	3:20:30	g	what 
3:21:35	3:21:42	g	IY would say 
3:22:28	3:22:35	g	be IY 
3:25:20	3:25:22	f	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
3:25:28	3:25:30	g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
3:25:55	3:26:4	g	ok 
3:26:30	3:26:33	f	ok 
3:28:47	3:28:55	f	yeah 
3:31:2	3:31:4	f	ok 
3:31:39	3:31:48	f	ok 
3:32:42	3:32:47	g	Hmm 
3:33:31	3:33:32	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
3:34:10	3:34:14	g	ok 
3:34:12	3:34:19	g	maybe 
3:34:22	3:34:27	g	ok 
3:36:39	3:36:44	g	ok 
3:36:57	3:37:1	f	and then what 
3:37:9	3:37:10	g	and 
3:40:25	3:40:27	g	well alright 
3:40:58	3:40:58	g	three inch 
3:41:16	3:41:17	g	uhm 
3:41:51	3:41:53	g	so 
3:42:40	3:42:44	g	IY just go down 
3:42:57	3:42:57	g	yes IY go towards the lake 
3:43:31	3:43:34	g	uhm 
3:44:6	3:44:8	f	plane crash IY don think be yeah 
3:44:20	3:44:20	g	an inch maybe a little bit less 
3:45:33	3:45:35	g	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
3:46:48	3:46:52	f	ok 
3:48:13	3:48:19	f	around the lake to the top 
3:49:22	3:49:31	f	do IY go around it 
3:49:42	3:49:49	f	ok 
3:51:1	3:51:9	f	uh IY don know know what to say 
3:52:15	3:52:15	g	maybe four inch on the paper 
3:52:58	3:53:0	g	a little 
3:54:0	3:54:7	g	no there no elephant 
3:56:46	3:56:55	g	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
3:58:17	3:58:24	g	and be to the leave 
4:3:37	4:3:43	f	to the leave of the antelope 
4:5:29	4:5:29	g	alright 
4:5:47	4:5:50	g	and IY go 
4:5:58	4:6:3	g	uhm 
4:12:7	4:12:13	g	and then IY go down 
4:12:23	4:12:32	g	just a slight slope 
4:12:47	4:12:47	g	three inch straight across 
4:13:3	4:13:6	g	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
4:13:56	4:14:5	g	and there a plane crash 
4:14:35	4:14:41	g	and then IY slope down to the leave 
4:15:30	4:15:33	g	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
4:16:6	4:16:11	f	and curve down to the leave 
4:18:30	4:18:33	g	ok 
4:23:55	4:23:58	g	no 
4:25:22	4:25:22	g	and 
4:25:52	4:25:56	g	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
4:26:22	4:26:30	g	uhm 
4:28:1	4:28:5	g	to the leave 
4:28:37	4:28:43	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
4:28:50	4:28:50	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
4:28:58	4:29:5	g	and that where the plane crash be 
4:30:50	4:30:58	g	couple mile or something 
4:30:57	4:31:1	f	IY hit some round rock 
4:31:47	4:31:51	g	and 
4:33:20	4:33:25	g	maybe like 
4:36:57	4:37:0	g	probably the same thing 
4:36:59	4:37:3	g	to the leave 
4:38:42	4:38:49	g	ok plane crash isn there 
4:39:40	4:39:45	f	IY have to back up a little bit 
4:40:59	4:41:6	g	like 
4:41:17	4:41:18	g	uhm IY straighten out slope 
4:41:26	4:41:29	f	uhm 
4:41:30	4:41:36	g	ok 
4:41:35	4:41:43	g	five 
4:43:10	4:43:18	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
4:45:25	4:45:31	g	they there 
4:46:32	4:46:32	g	go up like three three and a half inch 
4:49:33	4:49:37	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
4:52:59	4:53:6	g	and then IY come to a savannah 
4:53:8	4:53:17	g	where IY go down to a plane crash 
4:53:31	4:53:35	g	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
4:54:10	4:54:15	g	so anyway 
4:54:26	4:54:33	f	ok 
4:56:6	4:56:15	g	uhm 
4:57:21	4:57:25	g	after plane crash 
4:59:33	4:59:34	g	the slate mountain be towards the right 
5:1:16	5:1:20	g	to the right 
5:1:34	5:1:39	g	and then 
5:3:7	5:3:9	g	and then 
5:3:10	5:3:17	f	mm Hmm 
5:3:18	5:3:23	g	uhm 
5:3:50	5:3:54	g	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
5:5:22	5:5:29	g	uhm 
5:6:7	5:6:11	g	and then IY be 
5:6:8	5:6:13	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
5:6:36	5:6:45	g	not right at the stony desert 
5:9:36	5:9:38	f	IY a plane crash though 
5:10:0	5:10:5	g	to the leave 
5:11:41	5:11:42	g	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
5:14:24	5:14:29	g	like IY slope 
5:14:42	5:14:51	g	uh like 
5:14:59	5:15:5	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
5:15:26	5:15:29	g	ok 
5:15:50	5:15:54	f	around the top of the lake 
5:15:58	5:15:59	g	on sheet anyway 
5:16:26	5:16:29	g	but 
5:16:36	5:16:41	g	couple inch IY slope down 
5:16:42	5:16:43	f	mm Hmm 
5:18:21	5:18:24	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
5:19:40	5:19:45	g	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
5:20:14	5:20:16	g	a quarter of an inch 
5:22:55	5:22:55	g	so IY make circle 
5:23:56	5:24:1	g	so IY go three inch straight 
5:25:33	5:25:33	g	and then 
5:26:11	5:26:19	g	and then 
5:29:33	5:29:41	g	no IY don have a waterhole 
5:29:42	5:29:46	g	uhm 
5:30:5	5:30:6	g	after IY slope down IY say 
5:30:54	5:30:55	g	like 
5:32:52	5:32:58	g	a little bit too 
5:33:11	5:33:12	g	ok well 
5:33:19	5:33:22	g	that little slope 
5:34:12	5:34:18	g	plane crash
