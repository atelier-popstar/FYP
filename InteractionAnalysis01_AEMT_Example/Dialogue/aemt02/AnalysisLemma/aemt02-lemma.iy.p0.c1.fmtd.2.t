start
start g
0	0:1:57	0:2:6	do IY have roman bath 
1	0:6:24	0:6:28	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
2	0:7:50	0:7:59	so IY at the hot spring 
4	0:8:56	0:9:4	maybe four inch on the paper 
5	0:9:34	0:9:41	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
6	0:9:38	0:9:44	ok 
9	0:16:13	0:16:13	Hmm 
10	0:16:24	0:16:31	and then

16	0:23:48	0:23:49	ok 
17	0:25:49	0:25:56	be IY in like 
18	0:26:58	0:27:1	the slate mountain be towards the right 
19	0:27:54	0:27:55	they there 
22	0:32:25	0:32:29	to the white mountain 
23	0:32:47	0:32:52	so IY go three inch straight 
24	0:33:11	0:33:12	to right 
25	0:34:20	0:34:25	just a slight slope 
26	0:34:55	0:34:56	uhm 
29	0:36:35	0:36:35	straight up 
30	0:37:16	0:37:25	be IY in like almost the top of the 
34	0:40:17	0:40:24	like three inch 
35	0:40:43	0:40:43	and IY just go straight up 
36	0:41:11	0:41:12	ok well 
37	0:42:21	0:42:27	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
38	0:42:29	0:42:33	after IY go straight again 
40	0:44:10	0:44:18	and then 
41	0:44:16	0:44:23	ok 
43	0:47:47	0:47:56	what 
44	0:48:10	0:48:14	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
46	0:50:8	0:50:16	IY get 
47	0:50:35	0:50:44	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
49	0:51:40	0:51:49	like 
51	0:53:24	0:53:25	alright 
52	0:54:29	0:54:35	and 
53	0:54:49	0:54:56	IY at the plane crash 
55	0:56:16	0:56:18	be IY 
56	0:56:47	0:56:52	for like 
58	1:7:36	1:7:38	IY 
59	1:10:5	1:10:9	right next to circle should be roman bath 
60	1:10:15	1:10:23	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
61	1:11:51	1:11:52	so 
62	1:12:37	1:12:40	IY start 
64	1:17:21	1:17:27	IY start at the stony desert 
65	1:18:15	1:18:16	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
66	1:20:43	1:20:48	after plane crash 
67	1:22:32	1:22:35	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
68	1:23:57	1:23:58	five 
69	1:24:12	1:24:15	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
71	1:26:36	1:26:42	ok 
72	1:29:56	1:29:56	ok 
75	1:33:28	1:33:33	ok 
76	1:34:41	1:34:48	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
77	1:35:2	1:35:9	so anyway 
78	1:36:1	1:36:3	uhm 
79	1:37:3	1:37:8	three inch 
80	1:40:4	1:40:4	uhm 
83	1:44:46	1:44:46	ok plane crash isn there 
85	1:47:0	1:47:7	and then 
86	1:50:12	1:50:19	no there no elephant 
87	1:51:31	1:51:32	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
88	1:51:54	1:52:2	be IY anywere near there 
89	1:52:1	1:52:5	and there a plane crash 
90	1:52:20	1:52:20	on sheet anyway 
91	1:55:27	1:55:31	around the bottom of it 
93	1:57:5	1:57:13	IY kind of go 
95	1:58:35	1:58:39	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
96	2:3:42	2:3:48	to the lake 
99	2:4:15	2:4:22	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
100	2:4:37	2:4:43	and then 
101	2:6:34	2:6:39	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
104	2:9:49	2:9:57	and IY go 
105	2:10:53	2:10:57	plane crash 
106	2:12:25	2:12:25	IY just go down 
109	2:13:18	2:13:18	alright 
110	2:13:29	2:13:33	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
112	2:17:48	2:17:50	and then IY be 
113	2:17:50	2:17:52	the 
114	2:19:58	2:19:59	IY go about 
115	2:21:21	2:21:30	it right next to it 
116	2:21:37	2:21:45	like maybe an inch 
117	2:24:4	2:24:8	go up like three three and a half inch 
118	2:25:17	2:25:23	yes 
119	2:25:29	2:25:37	uhm

123	2:29:59	2:30:4	ok 
125	2:30:24	2:30:24	and then IY you go up 
127	2:34:11	2:34:19	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
128	2:34:27	2:34:27	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
129	2:34:49	2:34:50	and IY slope to the leave 
131	2:37:17	2:37:26	couple inch IY slope down 
132	2:39:59	2:40:3	uhm 
134	2:40:56	2:41:0	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
135	2:42:6	2:42:7	be the plane crash 
136	2:43:19	2:43:27	slight 
137	2:44:24	2:44:26	uhm 
138	2:46:21	2:46:26	and then IY go 
141	2:49:52	2:49:53	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
142	2:50:15	2:50:16	no 
145	2:54:34	2:54:43	like 
146	2:57:1	2:57:7	an inch maybe a little bit less 
148	2:57:30	2:57:38	uhm 
149	3:0:5	3:0:9	now IY at the collapse shelter 
150	3:0:7	3:0:11	about like 
152	3:1:14	3:1:21	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
153	3:1:30	3:1:38	IY have a waterhole on map 
155	3:4:43	3:4:43	ok IY at the savannah 
158	3:6:40	3:6:46	and then IY slope up 
159	3:9:43	3:9:47	no IY don have any rock 
161	3:12:27	3:12:28	then 
165	3:16:21	3:16:22	uhm 
166	3:16:25	3:16:34	yes IY go towards the lake 
167	3:16:36	3:16:43	yes 
169	3:18:22	3:18:27	uhm 
170	3:18:29	3:18:33	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
173	3:24:36	3:24:38	what 
175	3:27:29	3:27:38	maybe like 
177	3:28:20	3:28:20	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
178	3:30:19	3:30:25	ok 
179	3:30:34	3:30:34	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
180	3:30:34	3:30:34	probably the same thing 
182	3:33:8	3:33:14	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
186	3:38:23	3:38:24	where IY go down to a plane crash 
187	3:38:29	3:38:36	not right at the stony desert 
188	3:39:19	3:39:23	ok 
189	3:39:41	3:39:43	maybe 
190	3:40:22	3:40:29	uhm 
191	3:40:34	3:40:34	for like 
192	3:42:41	3:42:50	so IY make circle 
193	3:42:47	3:42:54	ok 
194	3:43:41	3:43:44	IY make 
195	3:43:40	3:43:46	like an inch 
196	3:44:36	3:44:40	IY slope down again 
199	3:50:20	3:50:20	just do it like this ok 
201	3:55:34	3:55:43	to the right 
203	3:56:43	3:56:46	and that where the plane crash be 
204	3:56:45	3:56:53	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
205	3:57:44	3:57:48	ok 
206	3:58:37	3:58:39	ok 
207	4:0:42	4:0:42	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
208	4:1:25	4:1:26	IY go straight down 
209	4:1:27	4:1:27	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
210	4:1:33	4:1:39	kind of across from stony desert 
211	4:2:54	4:2:59	to the leave 
212	4:4:51	4:5:0	ok 
213	4:5:45	4:5:45	maybe IY have different thing 
214	4:5:52	4:5:55	it not a big curve 
215	4:7:27	4:7:34	to the leave 
217	4:10:15	4:10:24	three inch 
218	4:10:46	4:10:46	and then 
219	4:12:10	4:12:16	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
220	4:12:19	4:12:27	and then IY come to a savannah 
222	4:14:27	4:14:35	ok 
223	4:14:46	4:14:46	ok and then IY go 
224	4:14:58	4:15:1	and then IY go down 
225	4:15:8	4:15:10	uhm 
226	4:15:38	4:15:39	from 
227	4:17:58	4:17:59	uhhh no 
228	4:18:14	4:18:14	no IY have 
229	4:20:48	4:20:52	and 
230	4:20:51	4:20:58	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
231	4:21:57	4:22:4	ok 
232	4:22:8	4:22:10	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
233	4:22:7	4:22:16	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
234	4:23:11	4:23:16	and 
235	4:23:18	4:23:19	IY just kind of slope down 
236	4:23:46	4:23:53	IY go like 
237	4:24:2	4:24:6	ok well 
238	4:24:9	4:24:13	but 
239	4:24:14	4:24:23	maybe like 
240	4:25:11	4:25:17	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
241	4:25:56	4:26:3	and then 
243	4:29:39	4:29:40	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
245	4:29:58	4:30:2	like 
247	4:31:2	4:31:10	ok 
248	4:33:36	4:33:42	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
249	4:35:9	4:35:15	IY wanna kind of curve 
250	4:36:8	4:36:15	and then IY slope down to the leave 
251	4:36:21	4:36:24	well just 
252	4:37:32	4:37:36	that little slope 
253	4:37:42	4:37:49	after IY slope down IY say 
254	4:39:32	4:39:32	be IY anywhere near there 
256	4:42:12	4:42:12	ok 
258	4:44:23	4:44:29	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
259	4:44:43	4:44:47	uhm 
260	4:45:25	4:45:29	to the leave of little path where path should be 
261	4:45:24	4:45:31	and IY go up like 
262	4:45:25	4:45:32	no 
263	4:46:17	4:46:25	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
264	4:46:27	4:46:28	well alright 
265	4:48:3	4:48:4	IY don know 
266	4:48:15	4:48:21	uh like 
267	4:48:34	4:48:42	IY would say 
268	4:50:47	4:50:51	like four or five inch to the leave 
269	4:52:35	4:52:36	ok 
270	4:53:47	4:53:52	after the circle 
271	4:55:28	4:55:33	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
272	4:56:43	4:56:51	alright be IY start near the 
273	4:57:53	4:57:56	uhm 
274	4:58:22	4:58:30	and it slope a little bit to the right 
275	4:59:3	4:59:5	there a there 
276	5:0:16	5:0:21	and IY should have a straight line there 
277	5:1:16	5:1:16	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
278	5:3:48	5:3:52	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
279	5:3:46	5:3:53	ok 
280	5:5:10	5:5:10	uhm and there be a stony desert 
281	5:5:18	5:5:21	uhm 
282	5:5:38	5:5:45	a little 
283	5:6:53	5:6:55	and 
285	5:7:20	5:7:24	and slope be about an inch long 
287	5:9:36	5:9:44	uhm 
288	5:12:52	5:12:56	IY slope 
291	5:20:11	5:20:12	like 
292	5:21:3	5:21:11	three inch straight across 
293	5:24:45	5:24:48	IY move to the leave 
294	5:26:19	5:26:24	and be to the leave 
295	5:26:18	5:26:27	and then 
298	5:33:44	5:33:45	uhm 
299	5:34:38	5:34:41	a quarter of an inch 
300	5:35:16	5:35:21	that about five or six inch 
301	5:35:59	5:36:0	so that about IY would say 
304	5:40:43	5:40:52	and then IY slope

308	5:45:2	5:45:5	and then 
309	5:45:11	5:45:18	ok 
310	5:45:25	5:45:28	away about like four inch four or five inch 
311	5:45:33	5:45:41	no IY don have a waterhole 
312	5:46:20	5:46:28	ok 
313	5:47:58	5:48:7	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
314	5:48:29	5:48:34	ok 
315	5:49:59	5:50:1	ok 
316	5:50:29	5:50:32	four or five inch to the leave 
317	5:51:15	5:51:20	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
318	5:51:16	5:51:21	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
322	6:1:0	6:1:3	uhm IY straighten out slope 
323	6:2:34	6:2:37	well 
324	6:4:13	6:4:13	for about two inch 
326	6:7:50	6:7:53	alright alright well just

328	6:8:43	6:8:52	uhm 
329	6:12:1	6:12:9	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
330	6:12:0	6:12:9	to the leave 
332	6:17:38	6:17:47	ok 
333	6:18:32	6:18:35	have a s 
334	6:21:8	6:21:14	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
335	6:22:27	6:22:30	IY actually start like right 
337	6:24:4	6:24:13	like IY slope 
340	6:27:42	6:27:43	and then IY go straight 
start f
3	0:8:28	0:8:33	ok 
7	0:11:29	0:11:35	and curve down to the leave 
8	0:15:43	0:15:50	to 
12	0:18:4	0:18:7	yeah and IY go straight up 
14	0:22:57	0:23:3	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
15	0:23:25	0:23:29	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
20	0:30:33	0:30:41	ok 
21	0:31:32	0:31:40	do IY go through anything

42	0:46:56	0:47:0	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
45	0:49:6	0:49:11	to the right 
48	0:51:5	0:51:14	and there a collapse shelter 
50	0:53:11	0:53:20	around the lake to the top 
54	0:55:41	0:55:50	to the leave of the antelope 
57	1:1:56	1:1:59	mm Hmm 
63	1:12:57	1:13:2	oh

84	1:45:47	1:45:51	ok 
92	1:56:27	1:56:30	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
94	1:57:47	1:57:51	IY have to back up a little bit 
97	2:3:42	2:3:50	ok 
98	2:4:4	2:4:13	ok

244	4:29:49	4:29:50	IY start yeah the stony desert 
246	4:30:23	4:30:28	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
255	4:40:17	4:40:22	yeah 
257	4:44:7	4:44:9	how many inch do IY think 
284	5:6:59	5:6:59	mm mm

296	5:30:37	5:30:37	yep 
297	5:31:55	5:31:58	no IY go with hot spring IY have 
302	5:39:21	5:39:23	IY plane crash IY be talk about earlier that up there 
303	5:39:32	5:39:41	ok wait hold on 
305	5:43:9	5:43:18	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
307	5:43:29	5:43:33	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash 
319	5:53:8	5:53:9	but that like five six inch from where IY be now 
320	5:53:58	5:53:58	mm Hmm 
321	6:0:27	6:0:36	IY hit some rock though 
325	6:6:5	6:6:9	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
331	6:16:52	6:17:1	IY a plane crash though 
336	6:22:32	6:22:36	plane crash IY don think be yeah 
338	6:24:26	6:24:35	IY at the savannah 
339	6:27:19	6:27:28	do IY go by the plane crash 
341	6:28:57	6:29:3	ok 
342	6:29:0	6:29:8	ok 
start g
0	0:1:57	0:2:6	do IY have roman bath 
1	0:6:24	0:6:28	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
2	0:7:50	0:7:59	so IY at the hot spring 
4	0:8:56	0:9:4	maybe four inch on the paper 
5	0:9:34	0:9:41	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
6	0:9:38	0:9:44	ok 
9	0:16:13	0:16:13	Hmm 
10	0:16:24	0:16:31	and then

17	0:25:49	0:25:56	be IY in like 
18	0:26:58	0:27:1	the slate mountain be towards the right 
19	0:27:54	0:27:55	they there 
22	0:32:25	0:32:29	to the white mountain 
23	0:32:47	0:32:52	so IY go three inch straight 
24	0:33:11	0:33:12	to right 
25	0:34:20	0:34:25	just a slight slope 
26	0:34:55	0:34:56	uhm 
29	0:36:35	0:36:35	straight up 
30	0:37:16	0:37:25	be IY in like almost the top of the 
34	0:40:17	0:40:24	like three inch 
35	0:40:43	0:40:43	and IY just go straight up 
36	0:41:11	0:41:12	ok well 
37	0:42:21	0:42:27	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
38	0:42:29	0:42:33	after IY go straight again

43	0:47:47	0:47:56	what 
44	0:48:10	0:48:14	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
46	0:50:8	0:50:16	IY get 
47	0:50:35	0:50:44	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
49	0:51:40	0:51:49	like

52	0:54:29	0:54:35	and 
53	0:54:49	0:54:56	IY at the plane crash 
55	0:56:16	0:56:18	be IY 
56	0:56:47	0:56:52	for like 
58	1:7:36	1:7:38	IY 
59	1:10:5	1:10:9	right next to circle should be roman bath 
60	1:10:15	1:10:23	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
61	1:11:51	1:11:52	so 
62	1:12:37	1:12:40	IY start 
64	1:17:21	1:17:27	IY start at the stony desert 
65	1:18:15	1:18:16	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
66	1:20:43	1:20:48	after plane crash 
67	1:22:32	1:22:35	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
68	1:23:57	1:23:58	five 
69	1:24:12	1:24:15	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
71	1:26:36	1:26:42	ok 
72	1:29:56	1:29:56	ok 
75	1:33:28	1:33:33	ok 
76	1:34:41	1:34:48	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
77	1:35:2	1:35:9	so anyway 
78	1:36:1	1:36:3	uhm 
79	1:37:3	1:37:8	three inch 
80	1:40:4	1:40:4	uhm 
83	1:44:46	1:44:46	ok plane crash isn there 
85	1:47:0	1:47:7	and then 
86	1:50:12	1:50:19	no there no elephant 
87	1:51:31	1:51:32	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
88	1:51:54	1:52:2	be IY anywere near there 
89	1:52:1	1:52:5	and there a plane crash 
90	1:52:20	1:52:20	on sheet anyway 
91	1:55:27	1:55:31	around the bottom of it 
93	1:57:5	1:57:13	IY kind of go 
95	1:58:35	1:58:39	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
96	2:3:42	2:3:48	to the lake 
99	2:4:15	2:4:22	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
100	2:4:37	2:4:43	and then 
101	2:6:34	2:6:39	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
104	2:9:49	2:9:57	and IY go 
105	2:10:53	2:10:57	plane crash 
106	2:12:25	2:12:25	IY just go down 
109	2:13:18	2:13:18	alright 
110	2:13:29	2:13:33	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
112	2:17:48	2:17:50	and then IY be 
113	2:17:50	2:17:52	the 
114	2:19:58	2:19:59	IY go about

128	2:34:27	2:34:27	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
129	2:34:49	2:34:50	and IY slope to the leave 
131	2:37:17	2:37:26	couple inch IY slope down 
132	2:39:59	2:40:3	uhm 
134	2:40:56	2:41:0	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
135	2:42:6	2:42:7	be the plane crash 
136	2:43:19	2:43:27	slight 
137	2:44:24	2:44:26	uhm 
138	2:46:21	2:46:26	and then IY go 
141	2:49:52	2:49:53	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
142	2:50:15	2:50:16	no 
145	2:54:34	2:54:43	like 
146	2:57:1	2:57:7	an inch maybe a little bit less 
148	2:57:30	2:57:38	uhm 
149	3:0:5	3:0:9	now IY at the collapse shelter 
150	3:0:7	3:0:11	about like 
152	3:1:14	3:1:21	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
153	3:1:30	3:1:38	IY have a waterhole on map 
155	3:4:43	3:4:43	ok IY at the savannah 
158	3:6:40	3:6:46	and then IY slope up 
159	3:9:43	3:9:47	no IY don have any rock 
161	3:12:27	3:12:28	then 
165	3:16:21	3:16:22	uhm 
166	3:16:25	3:16:34	yes IY go towards the lake 
167	3:16:36	3:16:43	yes 
169	3:18:22	3:18:27	uhm 
170	3:18:29	3:18:33	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
173	3:24:36	3:24:38	what 
175	3:27:29	3:27:38	maybe like 
177	3:28:20	3:28:20	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
178	3:30:19	3:30:25	ok 
179	3:30:34	3:30:34	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
180	3:30:34	3:30:34	probably the same thing 
182	3:33:8	3:33:14	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
186	3:38:23	3:38:24	where IY go down to a plane crash 
187	3:38:29	3:38:36	not right at the stony desert 
188	3:39:19	3:39:23	ok 
189	3:39:41	3:39:43	maybe 
190	3:40:22	3:40:29	uhm 
191	3:40:34	3:40:34	for like 
192	3:42:41	3:42:50	so IY make circle 
193	3:42:47	3:42:54	ok 
194	3:43:41	3:43:44	IY make 
195	3:43:40	3:43:46	like an inch 
196	3:44:36	3:44:40	IY slope down again 
199	3:50:20	3:50:20	just do it like this ok 
201	3:55:34	3:55:43	to the right 
203	3:56:43	3:56:46	and that where the plane crash be 
204	3:56:45	3:56:53	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
205	3:57:44	3:57:48	ok 
206	3:58:37	3:58:39	ok 
207	4:0:42	4:0:42	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
208	4:1:25	4:1:26	IY go straight down 
209	4:1:27	4:1:27	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
210	4:1:33	4:1:39	kind of across from stony desert 
211	4:2:54	4:2:59	to the leave 
212	4:4:51	4:5:0	ok 
213	4:5:45	4:5:45	maybe IY have different thing 
214	4:5:52	4:5:55	it not a big curve 
215	4:7:27	4:7:34	to the leave 
217	4:10:15	4:10:24	three inch 
218	4:10:46	4:10:46	and then 
219	4:12:10	4:12:16	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
220	4:12:19	4:12:27	and then IY come to a savannah 
222	4:14:27	4:14:35	ok 
223	4:14:46	4:14:46	ok and then IY go 
224	4:14:58	4:15:1	and then IY go down 
225	4:15:8	4:15:10	uhm 
226	4:15:38	4:15:39	from 
227	4:17:58	4:17:59	uhhh no 
228	4:18:14	4:18:14	no IY have 
229	4:20:48	4:20:52	and 
230	4:20:51	4:20:58	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
231	4:21:57	4:22:4	ok 
232	4:22:8	4:22:10	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
233	4:22:7	4:22:16	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
234	4:23:11	4:23:16	and 
235	4:23:18	4:23:19	IY just kind of slope down 
236	4:23:46	4:23:53	IY go like 
237	4:24:2	4:24:6	ok well 
238	4:24:9	4:24:13	but 
239	4:24:14	4:24:23	maybe like 
240	4:25:11	4:25:17	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
241	4:25:56	4:26:3	and then 
243	4:29:39	4:29:40	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
245	4:29:58	4:30:2	like 
247	4:31:2	4:31:10	ok 
248	4:33:36	4:33:42	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
249	4:35:9	4:35:15	IY wanna kind of curve 
250	4:36:8	4:36:15	and then IY slope down to the leave 
251	4:36:21	4:36:24	well just 
252	4:37:32	4:37:36	that little slope 
253	4:37:42	4:37:49	after IY slope down IY say 
254	4:39:32	4:39:32	be IY anywhere near there 
256	4:42:12	4:42:12	ok 
258	4:44:23	4:44:29	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
259	4:44:43	4:44:47	uhm 
260	4:45:25	4:45:29	to the leave of little path where path should be 
261	4:45:24	4:45:31	and IY go up like 
262	4:45:25	4:45:32	no 
263	4:46:17	4:46:25	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
264	4:46:27	4:46:28	well alright 
265	4:48:3	4:48:4	IY don know 
266	4:48:15	4:48:21	uh like 
267	4:48:34	4:48:42	IY would say 
268	4:50:47	4:50:51	like four or five inch to the leave 
269	4:52:35	4:52:36	ok 
270	4:53:47	4:53:52	after the circle 
271	4:55:28	4:55:33	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
272	4:56:43	4:56:51	alright be IY start near the 
273	4:57:53	4:57:56	uhm 
274	4:58:22	4:58:30	and it slope a little bit to the right 
275	4:59:3	4:59:5	there a there 
276	5:0:16	5:0:21	and IY should have a straight line there 
277	5:1:16	5:1:16	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
278	5:3:48	5:3:52	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
279	5:3:46	5:3:53	ok 
280	5:5:10	5:5:10	uhm and there be a stony desert 
281	5:5:18	5:5:21	uhm 
282	5:5:38	5:5:45	a little 
283	5:6:53	5:6:55	and 
285	5:7:20	5:7:24	and slope be about an inch long 
287	5:9:36	5:9:44	uhm 
288	5:12:52	5:12:56	IY slope 
291	5:20:11	5:20:12	like 
292	5:21:3	5:21:11	three inch straight across 
293	5:24:45	5:24:48	IY move to the leave 
294	5:26:19	5:26:24	and be to the leave 
295	5:26:18	5:26:27	and then 
298	5:33:44	5:33:45	uhm 
299	5:34:38	5:34:41	a quarter of an inch 
300	5:35:16	5:35:21	that about five or six inch 
301	5:35:59	5:36:0	so that about IY would say 
304	5:40:43	5:40:52	and then IY slope 
306	5:43:25	5:43:33	well 
308	5:45:2	5:45:5	and then 
309	5:45:11	5:45:18	ok 
310	5:45:25	5:45:28	away about like four inch four or five inch 
311	5:45:33	5:45:41	no IY don have a waterhole 
312	5:46:20	5:46:28	ok 
313	5:47:58	5:48:7	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
314	5:48:29	5:48:34	ok
