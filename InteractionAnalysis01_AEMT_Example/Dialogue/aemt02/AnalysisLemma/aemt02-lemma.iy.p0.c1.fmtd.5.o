start
0:2:3	0:2:10	g	and slope be about an inch long 
0:2:23	0:2:23	g	like maybe an inch 
0:2:26	0:2:33	g	alright 
0:5:21	0:5:25	f	ok 
0:5:42	0:5:50	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
0:5:49	0:5:58	g	four or five inch to the leave 
0:6:22	0:6:31	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
0:6:51	0:6:58	f	IY at the savannah 
0:10:40	0:10:45	f	ok 
0:11:8	0:11:8	f	mm Hmm 
0:13:26	0:13:26	g	and be to the leave 
0:13:27	0:13:31	g	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
0:18:43	0:18:47	g	and then 
0:21:2	0:21:6	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
0:22:17	0:22:26	g	ok 
0:24:7	0:24:14	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
0:24:51	0:24:53	f	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
0:26:59	0:27:5	g	and there a plane crash 
0:27:11	0:27:14	g	what 
0:27:29	0:27:35	f	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
0:27:35	0:27:38	g	ok 
0:27:46	0:27:48	g	after plane crash 
0:30:38	0:30:45	g	ok 
0:30:49	0:30:53	f	yeah 
0:31:14	0:31:18	g	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
0:31:33	0:31:36	g	IY move to the leave 
0:35:3	0:35:4	g	be IY in like 
0:37:25	0:37:28	g	no IY have 
0:38:8	0:38:9	g	be the plane crash 
0:39:23	0:39:28	g	ok 
0:40:21	0:40:21	g	ok 
0:42:36	0:42:36	g	uh like 
0:43:33	0:43:33	f	and 
0:44:51	0:44:59	g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
0:47:30	0:47:37	f	ok 
0:48:49	0:48:53	f	it not like in the same place IY describe 
0:48:58	0:48:58	f	ok 
0:50:27	0:50:27	g	like three inch 
0:50:55	0:51:4	g	maybe 
0:51:22	0:51:23	g	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
0:51:28	0:51:33	g	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
0:54:20	0:54:23	g	uhm 
0:54:40	0:54:42	g	yes IY go towards the lake 
0:57:26	0:57:26	g	and then IY slope down to the leave 
0:58:35	0:58:37	g	ok 
0:59:22	0:59:25	g	uhm 
1:0:10	1:0:17	g	to the white mountain 
1:0:33	1:0:37	f	so wait 
1:0:41	1:0:46	g	have a s 
1:1:1	1:1:4	g	around the bottom of it 
1:1:20	1:1:20	f	IY know IY have different thing so 
1:1:47	1:1:51	f	ok 
1:2:5	1:2:7	g	ok and then IY go 
1:3:1	1:3:6	g	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
1:3:5	1:3:7	g	and then IY you go up 
1:5:24	1:5:27	f	and to the right 
1:5:54	1:6:0	g	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
1:6:31	1:6:32	g	IY at the plane crash 
1:7:6	1:7:13	g	so that about IY would say 
1:10:13	1:10:20	g	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
1:10:45	1:10:47	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
1:11:13	1:11:19	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
1:11:27	1:11:27	g	uhhh no 
1:11:57	1:11:59	g	just do it like this ok 
1:13:51	1:13:57	g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
1:14:5	1:14:8	f	IY plane crash IY be talk about earlier that up there 
1:15:2	1:15:8	g	and IY slope to the leave 
1:15:32	1:15:38	g	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
1:16:2	1:16:6	f	to 
1:16:13	1:16:19	g	well 
1:16:32	1:16:35	g	ok 
1:17:42	1:17:50	g	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
1:18:11	1:18:17	g	that little slope 
1:18:38	1:18:46	g	so IY go three inch straight 
1:19:53	1:19:58	f	yeah 
1:20:13	1:20:18	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
1:20:56	1:21:3	g	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
1:21:10	1:21:13	g	and 
1:21:57	1:22:2	f	plane crash IY don think be yeah 
1:22:27	1:22:29	g	that about five or six inch 
1:23:20	1:23:27	f	IY have to back up a little bit 
1:24:34	1:24:36	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
1:25:49	1:25:50	g	ok 
1:27:10	1:27:19	g	ok 
1:28:43	1:28:48	g	ok 
1:28:58	1:29:5	g	and IY go straight up 
1:29:13	1:29:18	f	to the leave of the antelope 
1:30:51	1:30:54	f	ok 
1:31:35	1:31:43	g	five 
1:36:58	1:37:1	g	go up like three three and a half inch 
1:37:0	1:37:8	g	IY slope 
1:37:41	1:37:41	g	where IY go down to a plane crash 
1:37:43	1:37:52	g	ok 
1:39:48	1:39:53	f	ok 
1:43:19	1:43:28	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
1:44:3	1:44:7	f	mm Hmm 
1:44:9	1:44:11	f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
1:44:13	1:44:22	g	uhm IY straighten out slope 
1:45:26	1:45:26	g	ok 
1:46:44	1:46:44	g	IY 
1:47:21	1:47:24	g	and then IY go 
1:48:54	1:48:54	f	yeah 
1:49:13	1:49:16	g	and IY just go straight up 
1:50:9	1:50:14	g	ok 
1:52:24	1:52:26	g	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
1:52:51	1:52:51	g	uhm 
1:53:25	1:53:28	g	and then 
1:58:5	1:58:7	g	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
1:58:7	1:58:9	g	IY kind of go 
1:59:53	2:0:0	g	ok 
2:0:26	2:0:26	g	like 
2:3:17	2:3:17	g	yes 
2:3:40	2:3:44	g	ok 
2:4:8	2:4:13	f	no IY go with hot spring IY have 
2:4:23	2:4:23	g	be IY in like almost the top of the 
2:8:54	2:8:57	g	ok 
2:10:34	2:10:36	g	and then IY be 
2:12:39	2:12:40	g	so anyway 
2:14:46	2:14:49	g	ok 
2:19:26	2:19:31	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
2:20:58	2:21:0	g	uhm 
2:21:33	2:21:37	g	ok plane crash isn there 
2:22:22	2:22:24	f	yeah IY see 
2:23:7	2:23:14	g	they there 
2:23:16	2:23:17	g	for like 
2:23:21	2:23:22	g	IY actually start like right 
2:25:8	2:25:10	g	then 
2:25:44	2:25:44	g	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
2:25:57	2:26:0	g	alright 
2:30:54	2:31:0	g	and then 
2:32:27	2:32:29	g	ok 
2:33:26	2:33:27	g	no IY don have a waterhole 
2:34:21	2:34:28	g	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
2:36:6	2:36:13	f	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash 
2:37:38	2:37:46	g	be IY anywere near there 
2:39:43	2:39:45	g	and 
2:39:47	2:39:52	f	ok 
2:41:35	2:41:44	g	after the circle 
2:42:10	2:42:14	g	do IY have roman bath 
2:42:29	2:42:35	g	alright well IY keep go and see 
2:42:59	2:43:6	g	an inch maybe a little bit less 
2:45:51	2:45:54	g	IY get 
2:46:29	2:46:38	g	IY go straight down 
2:47:46	2:47:55	g	kind of across from stony desert 
2:50:0	2:50:5	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
2:50:13	2:50:22	g	IY go about 
2:51:10	2:51:19	g	IY make 
2:54:11	2:54:12	g	ok 
2:54:13	2:54:17	g	and then 
2:54:27	2:54:30	g	uhm 
2:55:23	2:55:27	g	well 
2:57:19	2:57:23	f	how many inch do IY think 
3:1:21	3:1:29	g	and then 
3:1:28	3:1:33	f	ok 
3:3:12	3:3:19	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
3:3:52	3:3:59	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
3:4:44	3:4:44	g	to the lake 
3:5:3	3:5:8	f	uhm 
3:5:25	3:5:27	g	to the leave 
3:5:32	3:5:36	g	and 
3:5:35	3:5:36	g	couple inch IY slope down 
3:5:36	3:5:40	g	and then 
3:6:16	3:6:25	g	to the leave 
3:8:7	3:8:13	g	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
3:8:59	3:8:59	f	and curve down to the leave 
3:10:0	3:10:6	g	to the leave 
3:10:44	3:10:51	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
3:13:45	3:13:46	g	away about like four inch four or five inch 
3:14:0	3:14:1	f	ok 
3:14:58	3:15:1	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
3:16:10	3:16:12	g	for about two inch 
3:17:20	3:17:25	g	no 
3:18:52	3:18:55	g	and then IY go straight 
3:20:37	3:20:44	g	IY wanna kind of curve 
3:23:57	3:24:3	g	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
3:24:42	3:24:50	g	IY start 
3:25:42	3:25:42	g	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
3:26:4	3:26:6	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY just ok 
3:27:30	3:27:39	g	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
3:27:35	3:27:43	g	like IY slope 
3:28:29	3:28:30	g	so 
3:29:52	3:29:56	f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
3:30:17	3:30:23	g	and 
3:31:50	3:31:52	g	straight up 
3:35:37	3:35:39	g	uhm 
3:36:29	3:36:35	f	around the lake to the top 
3:36:40	3:36:48	f	oh 
3:36:54	3:37:1	g	yes 
3:37:13	3:37:16	f	but that like five six inch from where IY be now 
3:40:32	3:40:34	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
3:41:21	3:41:22	f	IY three inch above the savannah 
3:41:59	3:42:8	f	IY hit some round rock 
3:42:27	3:42:28	f	yep 
3:43:56	3:43:59	g	IY go like 
3:45:13	3:45:21	g	like 
3:45:26	3:45:28	f	yeah and IY go straight up 
3:46:25	3:46:28	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
3:46:51	3:46:57	f	ok 
3:48:50	3:48:53	g	on sheet anyway 
3:49:51	3:49:53	g	well just 
3:52:43	3:52:52	g	so IY make circle

3:55:14	3:55:16	f	yeah 
3:55:13	3:55:21	g	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
3:55:18	3:55:24	f	ok 
3:57:4	3:57:9	g	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
3:59:8	3:59:16	f	IY start yeah the stony desert 
4:0:36	4:0:40	g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
4:2:21	4:2:23	g	ok 
4:2:41	4:2:50	g	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
4:3:48	4:3:55	g	maybe four inch on the paper 
4:5:28	4:5:29	g	like 
4:5:55	4:5:58	g	maybe like 
4:6:1	4:6:4	g	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
4:6:41	4:6:41	g	uhm 
4:7:50	4:7:58	g	ok 
4:9:13	4:9:20	g	about like

4:10:47	4:10:47	f	uh IY don know know what to say 
4:11:18	4:11:18	g	IY have a waterhole on map 
4:11:34	4:11:40	f	yeah 
4:11:52	4:11:56	f	ok 
4:12:15	4:12:24	f	do IY go around it 
4:13:7	4:13:12	g	and then 
4:15:4	4:15:7	g	now IY at the collapse shelter 
4:15:51	4:15:53	g	like an inch 
4:16:7	4:16:8	g	IY would say 
4:17:46	4:17:51	g	ok 
4:18:7	4:18:12	g	IY don know 
4:19:29	4:19:34	g	three inch 
4:21:53	4:21:56	g	after IY go straight again 
4:24:42	4:24:47	f	ok 
4:24:59	4:25:0	f	ok 
4:25:0	4:25:6	g	ok 
4:27:24	4:27:29	g	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
4:28:0	4:28:5	g	no IY don have any rock 
4:32:7	4:32:10	f	yeah 
4:33:23	4:33:31	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
4:33:38	4:33:43	g	be IY 
4:33:46	4:33:46	g	the 
4:35:25	4:35:28	f	mm Hmm 
4:35:50	4:35:57	g	maybe IY have different thing 
4:36:6	4:36:15	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
4:36:27	4:36:29	g	uhm 
4:37:33	4:37:40	g	and IY go up like 
4:37:44	4:37:50	f	ok wait hold on 
4:38:33	4:38:41	f	around the top of the lake 
4:40:3	4:40:5	g	a quarter of an inch 
4:41:6	4:41:6	g	not right at the stony desert 
4:41:37	4:41:39	f	ok 
4:44:11	4:44:14	f	ok 
4:44:49	4:44:49	g	alright be IY start near the 
4:45:6	4:45:10	g	plane crash 
4:45:32	4:45:34	f	mm Hmm 
4:46:1	4:46:10	f	up tp the right 
4:46:28	4:46:33	g	it not a big curve 
4:46:35	4:46:37	g	and then 
4:46:42	4:46:45	f	ok 
4:47:13	4:47:13	f	and then what 
4:48:10	4:48:17	g	and that where the plane crash be 
4:49:59	4:50:4	f	ok 
4:50:4	4:50:5	g	like four or five inch to the leave 
4:50:30	4:50:33	g	and then IY slope up 
4:51:52	4:51:59	f	ok 
4:52:31	4:52:33	g	just a slight slope

4:58:0	4:58:0	f	to the leave 
4:59:56	5:0:5	g	the slate mountain be towards the right 
5:1:0	5:1:9	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
5:4:36	5:4:40	g	to the right 
5:4:31	5:4:40	g	uhm 
5:5:11	5:5:16	g	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
5:7:59	5:7:59	g	uhm 
5:10:3	5:10:9	g	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
5:10:55	5:10:58	f	ok 
5:11:8	5:11:15	f	mm mm 
5:12:27	5:12:32	g	IY slope down again

5:14:4	5:14:10	f	to the right 
5:15:7	5:15:7	g	IY start at the stony desert 
5:17:3	5:17:3	f	ok 
5:18:59	5:19:4	g	probably the same thing 
5:19:43	5:19:52	f	IY go to a lake

5:33:12	5:33:14	g	and then IY come to a savannah 
5:33:20	5:33:23	g	no there no elephant 
5:36:54	5:36:54	g	a little bit too 
5:37:35	5:37:42	f	IY a plane crash though 
5:38:19	5:38:28	g	maybe like 
5:39:5	5:39:12	g	so IY at the hot spring 
5:40:2	5:40:3	g	no 
5:40:3	5:40:10	g	but 
5:43:40	5:43:45	g	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there
