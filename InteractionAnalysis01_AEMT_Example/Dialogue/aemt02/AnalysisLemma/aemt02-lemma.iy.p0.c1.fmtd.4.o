start
0:2:39	0:2:41	g	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
0:6:46	0:6:47	g	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
0:7:22	0:7:23	g	ok 
0:8:34	0:8:43	g	ok well 
0:9:37	0:9:45	g	then

0:15:27	0:15:32	g	it right next to it 
0:16:54	0:17:3	g	a little 
0:18:39	0:18:45	g	and then IY go down 
0:19:3	0:19:9	g	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
0:19:38	0:19:42	g	uhm IY straighten out slope 
0:20:35	0:20:37	g	ok 
0:26:11	0:26:15	g	and then IY you go up 
0:27:21	0:27:22	g	IY go about 
0:29:12	0:29:15	g	like an inch 
0:29:27	0:29:31	g	ok 
0:31:45	0:31:52	g	for like 
0:31:58	0:32:6	f	but that like five six inch from where IY be now 
0:32:43	0:32:47	f	ok 
0:33:34	0:33:35	f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
0:33:34	0:33:41	g	yes 
0:33:46	0:33:47	f	mm Hmm 
0:33:44	0:33:52	g	and IY go up like 
0:35:50	0:35:57	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
0:36:34	0:36:40	f	ok 
0:37:51	0:37:54	g	uhm 
0:40:49	0:40:56	f	yeah

0:47:26	0:47:29	g	they there 
0:47:42	0:47:45	f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
0:48:41	0:48:48	g	and then IY slope down to the leave 
0:48:42	0:48:48	f	ok 
0:49:35	0:49:40	g	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
0:50:40	0:50:45	f	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash 
0:52:55	0:52:59	g	uhm and there be a stony desert 
0:52:51	0:53:0	g	IY 
0:53:6	0:53:15	g	so IY make circle 
0:55:42	0:55:45	g	do IY have roman bath 
0:55:50	0:55:57	f	yeah 
0:56:34	0:56:40	g	about like 
0:57:14	0:57:16	g	IY slope 
0:57:45	0:57:51	g	so IY go three inch straight 
0:58:35	0:58:43	g	alright 
0:58:55	0:58:56	f	yeah 
1:0:0	1:0:0	g	uhm

1:3:5	1:3:14	g	like 
1:4:3	1:4:6	g	and then 
1:4:22	1:4:22	f	yeah IY see 
1:4:57	1:5:3	g	and then 
1:5:40	1:5:42	f	ok wait hold on 
1:11:11	1:11:20	f	ok 
1:11:59	1:12:2	g	ok 
1:12:29	1:12:37	g	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
1:14:4	1:14:7	g	be IY anywere near there 
1:15:0	1:15:5	g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
1:14:57	1:15:6	g	ok 
1:18:47	1:18:50	f	ok 
1:20:34	1:20:43	f	ok 
1:22:46	1:22:47	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
1:22:56	1:23:3	g	be the plane crash 
1:24:1	1:24:8	g	ok 
1:24:7	1:24:11	g	there a there 
1:25:10	1:25:11	g	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
1:26:1	1:26:8	g	maybe 
1:26:51	1:26:54	f	ok 
1:27:1	1:27:4	g	ok 
1:27:7	1:27:16	g	just do it like this ok 
1:28:16	1:28:18	g	a little bit too 
1:30:46	1:30:51	f	elephant 
1:31:54	1:31:57	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
1:32:28	1:32:32	g	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
1:33:21	1:33:21	g	and then IY slope up 
1:33:50	1:33:56	g	no IY have 
1:37:48	1:37:57	f	yeah 
1:38:5	1:38:7	g	IY just kind of slope down 
1:38:52	1:38:59	g	IY at the plane crash 
1:42:3	1:42:4	f	mm Hmm 
1:43:59	1:44:3	f	ok 
1:44:19	1:44:20	g	like four or five inch to the leave 
1:48:0	1:48:1	g	now IY at the collapse shelter 
1:48:24	1:48:32	g	and slope be about an inch long 
1:50:36	1:50:39	g	and 
1:51:25	1:51:34	f	ok 
1:51:51	1:51:51	f	IY at the savannah 
1:52:35	1:52:42	g	be IY anywhere near there 
1:53:36	1:53:37	g	uhm 
1:55:3	1:55:8	g	and that where the plane crash be 
1:56:18	1:56:26	g	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
1:58:17	1:58:26	g	no IY don have any rock 
2:0:25	2:0:28	g	uhm 
2:1:24	2:1:26	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
2:3:17	2:3:20	f	it not like in the same place IY describe 
2:4:17	2:4:22	f	ok 
2:8:14	2:8:19	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
2:8:42	2:8:44	g	IY slope down again 
2:9:17	2:9:20	f	ok 
2:10:33	2:10:34	g	three inch straight across 
2:12:11	2:12:17	g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
2:12:49	2:12:55	g	uhm 
2:12:58	2:13:5	g	just a slight slope 
2:14:33	2:14:42	f	around the lake to the top 
2:14:39	2:14:48	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
2:14:51	2:14:56	f	no IY go with hot spring IY have 
2:16:25	2:16:26	f	mm mm 
2:16:38	2:16:45	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
2:16:54	2:17:0	g	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
2:17:15	2:17:22	g	IY move to the leave 
2:17:31	2:17:35	g	to the white mountain 
2:19:16	2:19:17	g	uhm 
2:19:22	2:19:25	g	after the circle 
2:19:48	2:19:49	g	ok 
2:21:6	2:21:6	g	on sheet anyway 
2:22:35	2:22:35	g	no 
2:23:5	2:23:12	g	IY kind of go 
2:24:4	2:24:9	g	and then 
2:24:46	2:24:47	g	slight 
2:24:55	2:24:59	g	and then 
2:26:25	2:26:26	g	a quarter of an inch 
2:26:55	2:26:56	g	and then IY slope 
2:30:17	2:30:21	g	IY start at the stony desert 
2:34:46	2:34:55	g	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
2:34:53	2:34:58	f	yep 
2:35:7	2:35:15	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
2:36:41	2:36:49	g	and IY go straight up 
2:37:24	2:37:28	g	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
2:39:33	2:39:34	g	alright alright well just 
2:40:58	2:41:0	f	nope 
2:42:23	2:42:25	g	ok 
2:43:6	2:43:14	f	IY know IY have different thing so 
2:45:32	2:45:41	g	no 
2:48:36	2:48:45	g	IY start 
2:49:13	2:49:20	f	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
2:49:46	2:49:46	g	uhm 
2:51:2	2:51:2	f	and 
2:52:37	2:52:44	g	uhm 
2:52:50	2:52:54	f	around the top of the lake 
2:53:18	2:53:25	g	ok 
2:53:47	2:53:53	f	IY hit some rock though 
2:55:18	2:55:19	g	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
2:55:19	2:55:24	f	ok 
2:55:49	2:55:51	g	ok 
2:55:55	2:55:56	g	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
2:57:37	2:57:40	g	what 
2:59:1	2:59:9	f	mm Hmm 
2:59:10	2:59:16	g	ok and then IY go 
2:59:24	2:59:30	g	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
2:59:36	2:59:41	g	ok 
2:59:45	2:59:54	g	like three inch 
3:0:23	3:0:28	g	kind of across from stony desert 
3:0:34	3:0:35	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
3:1:3	3:1:7	g	and then 
3:2:24	3:2:27	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
3:3:57	3:4:0	g	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
3:5:27	3:5:29	g	like 
3:5:42	3:5:44	g	ok 
3:5:45	3:5:46	f	and curve down to the leave 
3:6:56	3:7:2	g	uhm 
3:7:4	3:7:5	g	it not a big curve 
3:8:37	3:8:41	g	uhm 
3:9:15	3:9:17	f	to 
3:9:59	3:10:0	g	after IY go straight again 
3:13:1	3:13:3	g	go up like three three and a half inch 
3:17:26	3:17:29	f	do IY go through anything 
3:18:49	3:18:55	f	to the leave of the antelope 
3:19:5	3:19:12	g	ok 
3:19:56	3:20:5	g	after IY slope down IY say 
3:20:27	3:20:32	g	uhm 
3:20:51	3:20:56	g	and IY just go straight up 
3:22:50	3:22:52	g	five 
3:23:36	3:23:42	f	uh IY don know know what to say 
3:25:19	3:25:23	g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
3:26:8	3:26:15	g	uhm 
3:26:54	3:26:57	g	maybe like 
3:27:38	3:27:43	g	IY would say 
3:30:56	3:31:2	g	well 
3:30:56	3:31:5	g	uhhh no 
3:31:21	3:31:23	g	IY get 
3:32:47	3:32:51	f	yeah and IY go straight up 
3:33:46	3:33:52	g	ok 
3:33:45	3:33:52	g	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
3:34:25	3:34:34	g	so that about IY would say 
3:35:18	3:35:26	g	that about five or six inch 
3:36:36	3:36:45	g	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
3:36:58	3:37:7	g	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
3:38:46	3:38:50	g	be IY 
3:40:27	3:40:27	g	no IY don have a waterhole 
3:42:19	3:42:19	g	IY go like 
3:43:26	3:43:26	g	and then IY be 
3:43:33	3:43:38	g	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
3:43:49	3:43:54	f	ok 
3:44:6	3:44:6	g	ok 
3:44:35	3:44:37	f	ok 
3:46:34	3:46:42	f	plane crash IY don think be yeah 
3:46:55	3:47:3	g	maybe IY have different thing 
3:47:31	3:47:36	g	to the right 
3:49:24	3:49:26	g	that little slope 
3:50:37	3:50:46	g	and IY slope to the leave 
3:52:27	3:52:31	g	IY actually start like right 
3:54:15	3:54:15	g	plane crash 
3:54:40	3:54:40	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
3:58:16	3:58:23	g	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
3:58:34	3:58:38	f	ok 
3:58:50	3:58:53	g	not right at the stony desert 
3:59:16	3:59:24	g	uh like 
4:2:21	4:2:21	g	and then 
4:2:22	4:2:30	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
4:2:37	4:2:40	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
4:3:16	4:3:20	g	ok well 
4:3:27	4:3:35	f	IY have to back up a little bit 
4:5:33	4:5:40	f	ok 
4:5:44	4:5:49	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
4:5:56	4:5:57	g	alright 
4:6:54	4:6:56	g	yes IY go towards the lake 
4:6:55	4:6:58	g	to the leave 
4:7:18	4:7:27	f	mm Hmm 
4:8:46	4:8:49	f	ok 
4:9:32	4:9:39	g	and then 
4:13:14	4:13:23	f	mm Hmm 
4:15:6	4:15:7	g	uhm

4:17:39	4:17:42	f	how many inch do IY think 
4:18:38	4:18:40	g	and then IY go 
4:18:46	4:18:51	g	ok 
4:22:7	4:22:13	g	three inch 
4:22:47	4:22:52	g	after plane crash 
4:25:16	4:25:18	g	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
4:25:47	4:25:54	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY just ok 
4:27:7	4:27:7	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
4:27:44	4:27:46	g	straight up 
4:28:16	4:28:16	f	yeah 
4:28:29	4:28:34	f	yeah

4:36:16	4:36:16	g	well alright 
4:37:1	4:37:4	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
4:38:31	4:38:39	g	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
4:39:26	4:39:27	g	IY make 
4:40:42	4:40:50	g	IY just go down 
4:42:31	4:42:32	g	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
4:44:54	4:45:3	g	from 
4:45:37	4:45:41	g	Hmm 
4:45:51	4:45:53	g	IY wanna kind of curve 
4:46:33	4:46:36	g	and 
4:46:48	4:46:50	g	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
4:49:39	4:49:42	g	like 
4:50:25	4:50:31	g	ok 
4:50:28	4:50:36	f	ok 
4:51:33	4:51:33	g	ok plane crash isn there 
4:53:0	4:53:5	g	and then 
4:53:29	4:53:37	f	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
4:54:4	4:54:5	f	ok 
4:55:7	4:55:7	g	have a s 
4:55:26	4:55:33	f	to the leave 
4:55:49	4:55:53	f	to the right 
4:58:21	4:58:27	f	uhm 
4:58:26	4:58:30	g	like 
4:59:13	4:59:19	g	to right 
5:0:30	5:0:39	g	probably the same thing 
5:4:20	5:4:24	g	uhm 
5:4:25	5:4:34	g	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
5:4:48	5:4:57	g	and then IY go straight 
5:6:16	5:6:23	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
5:9:30	5:9:34	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
5:9:42	5:9:44	g	well just 
5:11:58	5:11:59	g	three inch 
5:12:25	5:12:29	g	alright well IY keep go and see

5:16:56	5:16:57	f	ok 
5:17:21	5:17:27	g	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
5:17:44	5:17:51	g	uhm 
5:19:45	5:19:49	f	IY hit some round rock 
5:19:55	5:19:55	f	and there a collapse shelter 
5:20:37	5:20:42	g	and 
5:22:57	5:23:4	g	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
5:23:7	5:23:9	g	ok IY at the savannah 
5:23:12	5:23:16	g	so 
5:24:20	5:24:22	g	ok 
5:25:35	5:25:38	g	for like 
5:26:9	5:26:10	g	maybe four inch on the paper 
5:26:56	5:27:2	g	like IY slope 
5:29:55	5:29:58	f	IY plane crash IY be talk about earlier that up there 
5:30:45	5:30:53	g	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
5:34:38	5:34:43	g	ok 
5:34:54	5:35:3	g	ok 
5:36:29	5:36:30	g	four or five inch to the leave 
5:38:18	5:38:21	g	couple inch IY slope down 
5:39:1	5:39:6	g	be IY in like 
5:39:9	5:39:9	g	away about like four inch four or five inch 
5:39:33	5:39:39	g	yes 
5:39:40	5:39:45	f	up tp the right 
5:41:5	5:41:12	g	where IY go down to a plane crash 
5:42:21	5:42:27	g	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
5:42:42	5:42:44	g	ok 
5:44:22	5:44:29	f	ok
