start
0:0:2	0:0:4	g	no IY don have any rock 
0:2:19	0:2:19	g	ok IY at the savannah 
0:2:46	0:2:46	g	IY kind of go 
0:2:41	0:2:49	f	no IY go with hot spring IY have 
0:2:49	0:2:52	g	and then IY come to a savannah 
0:3:48	0:3:57	g	like 
0:4:14	0:4:22	g	three inch straight across 
0:4:42	0:4:48	g	and IY just go straight up 
0:4:44	0:4:52	g	ok 
0:8:11	0:8:18	f	mm Hmm 
0:8:41	0:8:43	g	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
0:12:4	0:12:6	g	ok 
0:12:7	0:12:10	f	ok 
0:12:26	0:12:28	g	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
0:13:24	0:13:30	g	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
0:13:35	0:13:37	f	ok 
0:16:5	0:16:8	g	after plane crash 
0:16:39	0:16:39	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
0:18:52	0:18:52	g	ok 
0:20:22	0:20:30	f	IY at the savannah 
0:23:47	0:23:50	f	ok wait hold on 
0:24:19	0:24:27	g	IY start 
0:25:37	0:25:44	g	like an inch 
0:26:12	0:26:17	f	ok 
0:27:21	0:27:26	g	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
0:30:9	0:30:15	g	and 
0:30:20	0:30:26	f	yeah 
0:30:44	0:30:53	f	to 
0:31:22	0:31:27	g	uhm 
0:32:48	0:32:52	g	alright alright well just 
0:34:9	0:34:9	f	how many inch do IY think 
0:35:32	0:35:33	g	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
0:38:0	0:38:8	g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
0:39:46	0:39:53	g	for like 
0:42:33	0:42:42	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
0:42:51	0:42:57	g	so that about IY would say 
0:43:36	0:43:44	g	IY at the plane crash 
0:43:56	0:44:1	g	ok 
0:45:28	0:45:31	f	IY a plane crash though 
0:47:9	0:47:16	g	uhm 
0:47:43	0:47:47	g	not right at the stony desert 
0:47:46	0:47:47	g	IY have a waterhole on map 
0:48:36	0:48:40	g	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
0:48:48	0:48:55	f	to the leave of the antelope 
0:50:30	0:50:36	g	ok 
0:52:21	0:52:26	g	uhm 
0:54:39	0:54:42	g	now IY at the collapse shelter 
0:54:39	0:54:46	g	ok well 
0:55:59	0:56:5	g	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
0:56:16	0:56:19	g	after IY go straight again 
0:57:28	0:57:29	g	well just 
0:57:39	0:57:40	f	IY hit some round rock 
0:58:0	0:58:0	g	what 
0:58:25	0:58:31	g	and IY go 
0:59:12	0:59:19	f	IY have to back up a little bit 
1:0:23	1:0:28	g	no IY don have a waterhole 
1:0:38	1:0:42	g	and 
1:1:31	1:1:37	f	IY start yeah the stony desert 
1:2:2	1:2:7	g	so anyway 
1:3:14	1:3:19	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
1:4:15	1:4:16	g	away about like four inch four or five inch 
1:4:46	1:4:49	f	ok 
1:6:47	1:6:48	f	ok 
1:7:3	1:7:12	g	and then IY slope down to the leave 
1:7:23	1:7:25	f	and then what 
1:8:24	1:8:28	g	and then IY go down 
1:12:49	1:12:56	g	ok 
1:15:37	1:15:37	f	mm Hmm 
1:17:58	1:17:58	g	three inch 
1:17:51	1:17:59	g	and 
1:19:17	1:19:20	f	elephant 
1:21:23	1:21:31	g	they there 
1:22:51	1:22:57	g	on sheet anyway 
1:23:29	1:23:38	f	ok 
1:24:4	1:24:4	g	and be to the leave 
1:25:40	1:25:47	g	be IY in like 
1:26:12	1:26:19	f	IY three inch above the savannah 
1:26:15	1:26:19	g	IY 
1:27:21	1:27:26	g	to the leave 
1:27:21	1:27:29	g	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
1:28:1	1:28:5	g	the 
1:29:52	1:29:56	g	to the white mountain 
1:30:12	1:30:12	f	and to the right 
1:31:6	1:31:10	g	do IY have roman bath 
1:31:33	1:31:35	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
1:31:42	1:31:47	g	and 
1:32:27	1:32:31	g	and that where the plane crash be 
1:32:32	1:32:35	f	and curve down to the leave 
1:33:35	1:33:38	g	ok 
1:34:3	1:34:8	g	ok 
1:35:25	1:35:32	f	IY know IY have different thing so 
1:38:35	1:38:40	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
1:38:57	1:38:57	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
1:40:59	1:41:1	g	ok 
1:41:18	1:41:23	g	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
1:42:55	1:42:56	g	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
1:42:59	1:43:4	f	ok 
1:43:55	1:44:1	g	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
1:43:55	1:44:3	g	uhm IY straighten out slope 
1:45:27	1:45:31	g	ok 
1:47:23	1:47:29	g	be IY 
1:49:4	1:49:5	g	and then 
1:55:0	1:55:9	f	ok 
1:55:25	1:55:29	g	a little 
1:55:29	1:55:34	g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
1:55:45	1:55:48	g	like maybe an inch 
1:56:11	1:56:18	g	and then IY go straight 
1:57:44	1:57:51	g	IY make 
1:59:9	1:59:18	g	a little bit too 
2:0:11	2:0:17	g	like IY slope 
2:0:31	2:0:40	f	uh IY don know know what to say 
2:0:37	2:0:45	g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
2:2:37	2:2:45	g	maybe like 
2:3:2	2:3:5	g	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
2:3:58	2:4:6	g	ok 
2:4:7	2:4:10	f	ok 
2:5:48	2:5:48	g	and IY go up like 
2:11:24	2:11:26	g	and then IY you go up 
2:12:12	2:12:14	g	uh like 
2:14:35	2:14:41	f	ok 
2:15:10	2:15:18	g	an inch maybe a little bit less 
2:15:26	2:15:28	g	but 
2:17:24	2:17:30	f	ok 
2:18:8	2:18:13	g	a quarter of an inch 
2:18:36	2:18:37	f	ok 
2:19:29	2:19:33	f	yeah 
2:23:24	2:23:31	f	IY hit some rock though 
2:23:34	2:23:39	f	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash 
2:23:51	2:23:56	g	to the lake 
2:25:4	2:25:6	g	ok 
2:26:53	2:27:1	g	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
2:28:29	2:28:32	g	uhm 
2:31:6	2:31:14	g	uhm 
2:32:21	2:32:24	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
2:38:26	2:38:31	g	just a slight slope 
2:39:23	2:39:23	g	and then 
2:41:7	2:41:16	g	like 
2:42:49	2:42:56	g	ok 
2:45:59	2:46:3	f	yeah 
2:50:46	2:50:47	f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
2:53:13	2:53:18	f	ok 
2:54:2	2:54:5	f	ok 
2:55:1	2:55:9	g	ok 
2:55:53	2:55:58	g	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
2:56:30	2:56:32	g	it right next to it 
2:57:28	2:57:36	g	alright 
3:1:6	3:1:8	g	alright 
3:1:6	3:1:12	g	straight up 
3:1:31	3:1:36	g	uhm 
3:1:34	3:1:37	g	no there no elephant 
3:1:48	3:1:55	f	ok 
3:2:41	3:2:45	g	Hmm 
3:2:55	3:2:55	g	maybe like 
3:2:54	3:2:58	g	uhm and there be a stony desert 
3:3:21	3:3:22	f	ok 
3:3:50	3:3:58	f	yeah and IY go straight up 
3:4:40	3:4:47	g	IY go about 
3:6:53	3:7:1	g	IY just go down 
3:6:57	3:7:6	f	do IY go around it 
3:9:18	3:9:25	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
3:10:30	3:10:39	g	five 
3:10:53	3:11:1	f	mm Hmm 
3:12:59	3:13:4	g	yes IY go towards the lake 
3:13:46	3:13:51	g	couple mile or something 
3:13:51	3:13:53	g	after the circle 
3:13:55	3:14:0	f	it not like in the same place IY describe 
3:14:3	3:14:5	g	and then IY slope up 
3:14:10	3:14:12	g	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
3:14:31	3:14:37	g	that about five or six inch 
3:14:34	3:14:43	g	IY wanna kind of curve 
3:17:37	3:17:46	g	like four or five inch to the leave 
3:19:17	3:19:23	g	go up like three three and a half inch 
3:19:47	3:19:47	g	uhm 
3:21:48	3:21:55	g	four or five inch to the leave 
3:22:19	3:22:27	g	IY don know 
3:22:52	3:22:57	g	uhm 
3:25:34	3:25:34	g	like three inch 
3:25:28	3:25:35	f	and there a collapse shelter 
3:29:9	3:29:17	g	well 
3:31:34	3:31:37	g	ok 
3:32:39	3:32:39	g	ok well 
3:32:58	3:33:0	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY just ok 
3:37:11	3:37:11	g	be IY anywere near there 
3:38:56	3:39:4	g	plane crash 
3:39:34	3:39:37	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
3:44:35	3:44:39	f	and 
3:45:8	3:45:14	g	be IY anywhere near there 
3:46:27	3:46:28	g	ok 
3:47:23	3:47:23	g	so IY at the hot spring 
3:48:6	3:48:8	g	alright well IY keep go and see 
3:48:46	3:48:47	g	be IY in like almost the top of the 
3:49:46	3:49:49	f	plane crash IY don think be yeah 
3:49:50	3:49:53	f	yeah 
3:50:29	3:50:30	g	ok 
3:54:45	3:54:49	g	uhm 
3:56:47	3:56:51	g	about like 
3:57:44	3:57:52	f	around the lake to the top 
3:57:54	3:58:1	g	and slope be about an inch long 
3:58:51	3:58:51	g	ok 
3:59:41	3:59:47	g	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
3:59:48	3:59:49	f	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
4:2:2	4:2:7	g	where IY go down to a plane crash 
4:2:32	4:2:36	g	it not a big curve 
4:4:19	4:4:28	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
4:4:22	4:4:31	g	IY start at the stony desert 
4:5:52	4:5:57	g	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
4:7:25	4:7:26	f	ok 
4:7:29	4:7:30	g	to the leave 
4:8:7	4:8:16	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
4:11:18	4:11:20	g	and then IY slope 
4:12:19	4:12:27	g	maybe four inch on the paper 
4:12:30	4:12:38	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
4:13:19	4:13:19	g	and then IY be 
4:13:28	4:13:31	g	be the plane crash 
4:13:39	4:13:42	f	ok 
4:14:41	4:14:43	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
4:14:52	4:14:55	g	ok 
4:15:28	4:15:29	g	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
4:15:41	4:15:41	g	to right 
4:17:12	4:17:15	g	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
4:17:35	4:17:44	g	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
4:18:58	4:19:0	f	do IY go through anything 
4:19:2	4:19:8	g	IY go like 
4:20:46	4:20:54	g	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
4:22:16	4:22:22	f	ok 
4:27:11	4:27:12	g	and then 
4:28:2	4:28:10	f	ok 
4:28:23	4:28:23	g	uhm 
4:30:18	4:30:18	g	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
4:31:18	4:31:21	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
4:31:56	4:32:5	g	and then 
4:32:2	4:32:6	f	ok 
4:33:1	4:33:10	g	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
4:33:21	4:33:29	f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
4:33:36	4:33:38	g	just do it like this ok 
4:34:35	4:34:37	g	IY just kind of slope down 
4:35:17	4:35:20	f	around the top of the lake 
4:35:29	4:35:35	g	ok 
4:35:29	4:35:36	g	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
4:36:0	4:36:0	g	probably the same thing 
4:37:38	4:37:40	g	uhm 
4:40:22	4:40:25	g	IY move to the leave 
4:41:35	4:41:43	g	and then IY go 
4:42:1	4:42:8	g	maybe IY have different thing 
4:43:35	4:43:40	g	kind of across from stony desert 
4:45:9	4:45:10	g	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
4:46:22	4:46:22	g	ok 
4:46:18	4:46:24	f	mm Hmm 
4:46:56	4:46:57	f	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
4:47:44	4:47:47	f	mm Hmm 
4:47:44	4:47:53	g	and IY slope to the leave 
4:50:36	4:50:44	g	and then 
4:53:41	4:53:44	f	yeah 
4:53:49	4:53:50	g	uhm 
4:54:1	4:54:10	g	the slate mountain be towards the right 
4:56:32	4:56:35	f	ok 
4:58:25	4:58:29	f	ok 
4:58:28	4:58:32	g	and IY go straight up 
4:58:55	4:59:3	g	ok 
4:59:13	4:59:16	g	around the bottom of it 
5:2:44	5:2:51	g	yes 
5:4:53	5:5:1	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
5:6:54	5:6:54	f	yeah 
5:7:51	5:7:51	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
5:7:57	5:8:2	g	from 
5:9:7	5:9:10	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
5:10:10	5:10:15	g	no 
5:10:10	5:10:18	f	up tp the right 
5:10:16	5:10:20	g	so IY make circle 
5:12:38	5:12:39	g	uhm 
5:12:39	5:12:41	g	ok 
5:14:56	5:15:1	g	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
5:15:10	5:15:18	g	ok and then IY go 
5:15:11	5:15:20	g	IY would say 
5:16:12	5:16:14	f	to the right 
5:18:19	5:18:21	g	IY get 
5:18:43	5:18:47	g	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
5:19:20	5:19:24	f	oh 
5:19:50	5:19:52	g	uhm 
5:20:50	5:20:50	g	like 
5:20:46	5:20:51	g	for about two inch 
5:23:58	5:24:1	g	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
5:25:9	5:25:11	g	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
5:25:44	5:25:46	g	and then 
5:25:52	5:25:55	g	and there a plane crash 
5:29:14	5:29:20	g	so IY go three inch straight 
5:29:23	5:29:26	g	three inch 
5:31:29	5:31:30	g	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
5:31:41	5:31:45	g	so 
5:32:0	5:32:6	g	what 
5:33:22	5:33:23	g	after IY slope down IY say 
5:33:21	5:33:30	f	yeah 
5:34:49	5:34:56	g	slight 
5:35:27	5:35:34	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
5:37:21	5:37:26	g	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
5:38:31	5:38:38	g	IY go straight down 
5:40:33	5:40:38	f	ok 
5:43:19	5:43:19	g	ok 
5:44:49	5:44:49	f	uhm 
5:44:57	5:45:6	f	mm mm 
5:46:47	5:46:52	f	yeah IY see 
5:47:46	5:47:55	g	no IY have 
5:47:55	5:47:58	g	IY slope down again 
5:48:2	5:48:2	g	then 
5:48:18	5:48:26	g	uhm 
5:48:34	5:48:37	g	uhm
