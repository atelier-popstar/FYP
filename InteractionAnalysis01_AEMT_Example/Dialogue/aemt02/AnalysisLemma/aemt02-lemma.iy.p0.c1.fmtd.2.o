start
0:1:57	0:2:6	g	do IY have roman bath 
0:6:24	0:6:28	g	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
0:7:50	0:7:59	g	so IY at the hot spring 
0:8:28	0:8:33	f	ok 
0:8:56	0:9:4	g	maybe four inch on the paper 
0:9:34	0:9:41	g	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
0:9:38	0:9:44	g	ok 
0:11:29	0:11:35	f	and curve down to the leave 
0:15:43	0:15:50	f	to 
0:16:13	0:16:13	g	Hmm 
0:16:24	0:16:31	g	and then 
0:17:51	0:17:56	g	and IY go straight up 
0:18:4	0:18:7	f	yeah and IY go straight up 
0:22:47	0:22:47	g	ok 
0:22:57	0:23:3	f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
0:23:25	0:23:29	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
0:23:48	0:23:49	g	ok 
0:25:49	0:25:56	g	be IY in like 
0:26:58	0:27:1	g	the slate mountain be towards the right 
0:27:54	0:27:55	g	they there 
0:30:33	0:30:41	f	ok 
0:31:32	0:31:40	f	do IY go through anything 
0:32:25	0:32:29	g	to the white mountain 
0:32:47	0:32:52	g	so IY go three inch straight 
0:33:11	0:33:12	g	to right 
0:34:20	0:34:25	g	just a slight slope 
0:34:55	0:34:56	g	uhm 
0:35:0	0:35:1	f	ok 
0:36:20	0:36:22	f	ok 
0:36:35	0:36:35	g	straight up 
0:37:16	0:37:25	g	be IY in like almost the top of the 
0:38:8	0:38:17	f	yeah 
0:40:8	0:40:16	f	yeah 
0:40:15	0:40:18	f	and 
0:40:17	0:40:24	g	like three inch 
0:40:43	0:40:43	g	and IY just go straight up 
0:41:11	0:41:12	g	ok well 
0:42:21	0:42:27	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
0:42:29	0:42:33	g	after IY go straight again 
0:42:40	0:42:48	f	ok 
0:44:10	0:44:18	g	and then 
0:44:16	0:44:23	g	ok 
0:46:56	0:47:0	f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
0:47:47	0:47:56	g	what 
0:48:10	0:48:14	g	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
0:49:6	0:49:11	f	to the right 
0:50:8	0:50:16	g	IY get 
0:50:35	0:50:44	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
0:51:5	0:51:14	f	and there a collapse shelter 
0:51:40	0:51:49	g	like 
0:53:11	0:53:20	f	around the lake to the top 
0:53:24	0:53:25	g	alright 
0:54:29	0:54:35	g	and 
0:54:49	0:54:56	g	IY at the plane crash 
0:55:41	0:55:50	f	to the leave of the antelope 
0:56:16	0:56:18	g	be IY 
0:56:47	0:56:52	g	for like 
1:1:56	1:1:59	f	mm Hmm 
1:7:36	1:7:38	g	IY 
1:10:5	1:10:9	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
1:10:15	1:10:23	g	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
1:11:51	1:11:52	g	so 
1:12:37	1:12:40	g	IY start 
1:12:57	1:13:2	f	oh 
1:17:21	1:17:27	g	IY start at the stony desert 
1:18:15	1:18:16	g	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
1:20:43	1:20:48	g	after plane crash 
1:22:32	1:22:35	g	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
1:23:57	1:23:58	g	five 
1:24:12	1:24:15	g	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
1:26:34	1:26:42	f	uhm 
1:26:36	1:26:42	g	ok 
1:29:56	1:29:56	g	ok 
1:31:16	1:31:17	f	ok 
1:33:28	1:33:29	f	yeah 
1:33:28	1:33:33	g	ok 
1:34:41	1:34:48	g	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
1:35:2	1:35:9	g	so anyway 
1:36:1	1:36:3	g	uhm 
1:37:3	1:37:8	g	three inch 
1:40:4	1:40:4	g	uhm 
1:41:44	1:41:52	f	and then what 
1:42:0	1:42:7	f	IY go to a lake 
1:44:46	1:44:46	g	ok plane crash isn there 
1:45:47	1:45:51	f	ok 
1:47:0	1:47:7	g	and then 
1:50:12	1:50:19	g	no there no elephant 
1:51:31	1:51:32	g	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
1:51:54	1:52:2	g	be IY anywere near there 
1:52:1	1:52:5	g	and there a plane crash 
1:52:20	1:52:20	g	on sheet anyway 
1:55:27	1:55:31	g	around the bottom of it 
1:56:27	1:56:30	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
1:57:5	1:57:13	g	IY kind of go 
1:57:47	1:57:51	f	IY have to back up a little bit 
1:58:35	1:58:39	g	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
2:3:42	2:3:48	g	to the lake 
2:3:42	2:3:50	f	ok 
2:4:4	2:4:13	f	ok 
2:4:15	2:4:22	g	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
2:4:37	2:4:43	g	and then 
2:6:34	2:6:39	g	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
2:6:36	2:6:45	f	ok 
2:7:58	2:8:1	f	IY know IY have different thing so 
2:9:49	2:9:57	g	and IY go 
2:10:53	2:10:57	g	plane crash 
2:12:25	2:12:25	g	IY just go down 
2:12:50	2:12:51	f	yeah 
2:12:46	2:12:55	f	yeah 
2:13:18	2:13:18	g	alright 
2:13:29	2:13:33	g	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
2:16:21	2:16:22	f	mm Hmm 
2:17:48	2:17:50	g	and then IY be 
2:17:50	2:17:52	g	the 
2:19:58	2:19:59	g	IY go about 
2:21:21	2:21:30	g	it right next to it 
2:21:37	2:21:45	g	like maybe an inch 
2:24:4	2:24:8	g	go up like three three and a half inch

2:32:16	2:32:24	f	ok 
2:34:11	2:34:19	g	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
2:34:27	2:34:27	g	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
2:34:49	2:34:50	g	and IY slope to the leave 
2:35:59	2:36:8	f	ok 
2:37:17	2:37:26	g	couple inch IY slope down 
2:39:59	2:40:3	g	uhm 
2:40:3	2:40:7	f	yeah 
2:40:56	2:41:0	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
2:42:6	2:42:7	g	be the plane crash 
2:43:19	2:43:27	g	slight 
2:44:24	2:44:26	g	uhm 
2:46:21	2:46:26	g	and then IY go

2:48:41	2:48:44	f	ok 
2:49:52	2:49:53	g	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
2:50:15	2:50:16	g	no 
2:50:29	2:50:38	f	ok 
2:54:2	2:54:3	f	so wait

2:57:30	2:57:38	g	uhm 
3:0:5	3:0:9	g	now IY at the collapse shelter 
3:0:7	3:0:11	g	about like 
3:0:52	3:0:52	f	ok 
3:1:14	3:1:21	g	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
3:1:30	3:1:38	g	IY have a waterhole on map 
3:2:32	3:2:40	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
3:4:43	3:4:43	g	ok IY at the savannah 
3:5:39	3:5:41	f	IY three inch above the savannah 
3:6:30	3:6:39	f	mm Hmm 
3:6:40	3:6:46	g	and then IY slope up 
3:9:43	3:9:47	g	no IY don have any rock 
3:11:4	3:11:6	f	ok 
3:12:27	3:12:28	g	then 
3:12:53	3:13:1	f	up tp the right

3:18:22	3:18:27	g	uhm 
3:18:29	3:18:33	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
3:18:50	3:18:58	f	it not like in the same place IY describe 
3:24:21	3:24:22	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY just ok 
3:24:36	3:24:38	g	what 
3:25:42	3:25:48	f	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
3:27:29	3:27:38	g	maybe like 
3:27:36	3:27:40	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
3:28:20	3:28:20	g	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
3:30:19	3:30:25	g	ok 
3:30:34	3:30:34	g	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
3:30:34	3:30:34	g	probably the same thing 
3:31:12	3:31:12	f	IY hit some round rock 
3:33:8	3:33:14	g	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
3:34:1	3:34:2	f	elephant 
3:34:6	3:34:15	f	ok 
3:37:37	3:37:37	f	mm Hmm 
3:38:23	3:38:24	g	where IY go down to a plane crash 
3:38:29	3:38:36	g	not right at the stony desert 
3:39:19	3:39:23	g	ok 
3:39:41	3:39:43	g	maybe 
3:40:22	3:40:29	g	uhm 
3:40:34	3:40:34	g	for like 
3:42:41	3:42:50	g	so IY make circle 
3:42:47	3:42:54	g	ok 
3:43:41	3:43:44	g	IY make 
3:43:40	3:43:46	g	like an inch 
3:44:36	3:44:40	g	IY slope down again 
3:44:46	3:44:53	f	to the leave 
3:45:33	3:45:34	f	and to the right 
3:50:20	3:50:20	g	just do it like this ok 
3:55:12	3:55:20	f	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
3:55:34	3:55:43	g	to the right 
3:56:27	3:56:34	f	yeah IY see 
3:56:43	3:56:46	g	and that where the plane crash be 
3:56:45	3:56:53	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
3:57:44	3:57:48	g	ok 
3:58:37	3:58:39	g	ok 
4:0:42	4:0:42	g	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
4:1:25	4:1:26	g	IY go straight down 
4:1:27	4:1:27	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
4:1:33	4:1:39	g	kind of across from stony desert 
4:2:54	4:2:59	g	to the leave 
4:4:51	4:5:0	g	ok 
4:5:45	4:5:45	g	maybe IY have different thing 
4:5:52	4:5:55	g	it not a big curve 
4:7:27	4:7:34	g	to the leave 
4:10:4	4:10:11	f	ok 
4:10:15	4:10:24	g	three inch 
4:10:46	4:10:46	g	and then 
4:12:10	4:12:16	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
4:12:19	4:12:27	g	and then IY come to a savannah 
4:12:37	4:12:44	f	ok 
4:14:27	4:14:35	g	ok 
4:14:46	4:14:46	g	ok and then IY go 
4:14:58	4:15:1	g	and then IY go down 
4:15:8	4:15:10	g	uhm 
4:15:38	4:15:39	g	from 
4:17:58	4:17:59	g	uhhh no 
4:18:14	4:18:14	g	no IY have 
4:20:48	4:20:52	g	and 
4:20:51	4:20:58	g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
4:21:57	4:22:4	g	ok 
4:22:8	4:22:10	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
4:22:7	4:22:16	g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
4:23:11	4:23:16	g	and 
4:23:18	4:23:19	g	IY just kind of slope down 
4:23:46	4:23:53	g	IY go like 
4:24:2	4:24:6	g	ok well 
4:24:9	4:24:13	g	but 
4:24:14	4:24:23	g	maybe like 
4:25:11	4:25:17	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
4:25:56	4:26:3	g	and then 
4:26:17	4:26:22	f	ok 
4:29:39	4:29:40	g	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
4:29:49	4:29:50	f	IY start yeah the stony desert 
4:29:58	4:30:2	g	like 
4:30:23	4:30:28	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
4:31:2	4:31:10	g	ok 
4:33:36	4:33:42	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
4:35:9	4:35:15	g	IY wanna kind of curve 
4:36:8	4:36:15	g	and then IY slope down to the leave 
4:36:21	4:36:24	g	well just 
4:37:32	4:37:36	g	that little slope 
4:37:42	4:37:49	g	after IY slope down IY say 
4:39:32	4:39:32	g	be IY anywhere near there 
4:40:17	4:40:22	f	yeah 
4:42:12	4:42:12	g	ok 
4:44:7	4:44:9	f	how many inch do IY think 
4:44:23	4:44:29	g	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
4:44:43	4:44:47	g	uhm 
4:45:25	4:45:29	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
4:45:24	4:45:31	g	and IY go up like 
4:45:25	4:45:32	g	no 
4:46:17	4:46:25	g	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
4:46:27	4:46:28	g	well alright 
4:48:3	4:48:4	g	IY don know 
4:48:15	4:48:21	g	uh like 
4:48:34	4:48:42	g	IY would say 
4:50:47	4:50:51	g	like four or five inch to the leave 
4:52:35	4:52:36	g	ok 
4:53:47	4:53:52	g	after the circle 
4:55:28	4:55:33	g	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
4:56:43	4:56:51	g	alright be IY start near the 
4:57:53	4:57:56	g	uhm 
4:58:22	4:58:30	g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
4:59:3	4:59:5	g	there a there 
5:0:16	5:0:21	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
5:1:16	5:1:16	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
5:3:48	5:3:52	g	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
5:3:46	5:3:53	g	ok 
5:5:10	5:5:10	g	uhm and there be a stony desert 
5:5:18	5:5:21	g	uhm 
5:5:38	5:5:45	g	a little 
5:6:53	5:6:55	g	and 
5:6:59	5:6:59	f	mm mm 
5:7:20	5:7:24	g	and slope be about an inch long 
5:7:46	5:7:46	f	ok 
5:9:36	5:9:44	g	uhm 
5:12:52	5:12:56	g	IY slope 
5:17:6	5:17:12	f	nope 
5:17:31	5:17:36	f	around the top of the lake 
5:20:11	5:20:12	g	like 
5:21:3	5:21:11	g	three inch straight across 
5:24:45	5:24:48	g	IY move to the leave 
5:26:19	5:26:24	g	and be to the leave 
5:26:18	5:26:27	g	and then 
5:30:37	5:30:37	f	yep 
5:31:55	5:31:58	f	no IY go with hot spring IY have 
5:33:44	5:33:45	g	uhm 
5:34:38	5:34:41	g	a quarter of an inch 
5:35:16	5:35:21	g	that about five or six inch 
5:35:59	5:36:0	g	so that about IY would say 
5:39:21	5:39:23	f	IY plane crash IY be talk about earlier that up there 
5:39:32	5:39:41	f	ok wait hold on 
5:40:43	5:40:52	g	and then IY slope 
5:43:9	5:43:18	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
5:43:25	5:43:33	g	well 
5:43:29	5:43:33	f	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash
