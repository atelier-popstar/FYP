start
0:0:20	0:0:26	g	ok 
0:2:33	0:2:42	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
0:3:57	0:4:2	g	like 
0:5:33	0:5:39	g	then 
0:7:28	0:7:29	g	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
0:7:23	0:7:30	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
0:8:34	0:8:41	g	no IY don have a waterhole 
0:9:12	0:9:13	g	be the plane crash 
0:10:44	0:10:46	f	IY at the savannah 
0:14:38	0:14:47	g	ok 
0:15:31	0:15:35	g	and then 
0:17:21	0:17:30	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
0:17:54	0:17:57	g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
0:18:48	0:18:55	g	it not a big curve 
0:19:33	0:19:35	g	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
0:21:45	0:21:49	f	IY hit some round rock 
0:22:42	0:22:51	g	to the leave 
0:23:3	0:23:10	g	like 
0:25:25	0:25:33	g	there a there 
0:25:28	0:25:37	g	and then 
0:25:54	0:25:56	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
0:25:56	0:26:1	g	uhm 
0:26:13	0:26:14	f	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash 
0:28:0	0:28:3	f	ok 
0:28:48	0:28:51	g	be IY in like 
0:28:54	0:29:0	g	IY just go down 
0:29:18	0:29:21	g	uhm 
0:31:4	0:31:8	g	around the bottom of it 
0:31:31	0:31:36	f	ok 
0:31:30	0:31:39	g	and that where the plane crash be 
0:33:49	0:33:55	g	and then 
0:33:57	0:33:58	f	ok 
0:36:45	0:36:47	g	away about like four inch four or five inch 
0:40:35	0:40:37	f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
0:41:51	0:42:0	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
0:41:59	0:42:2	g	be IY in like almost the top of the 
0:42:4	0:42:9	g	for about two inch 
0:47:43	0:47:45	g	IY go straight down 
0:47:45	0:47:51	g	it right next to it 
0:48:27	0:48:31	g	couple mile or something 
0:48:36	0:48:43	g	alright well IY keep go and see 
0:48:39	0:48:47	g	after IY slope down IY say 
0:49:9	0:49:12	g	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
0:49:57	0:50:1	g	ok 
0:50:16	0:50:18	g	straight up 
0:51:28	0:51:30	g	on sheet anyway 
0:51:42	0:51:46	g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
0:53:58	0:53:59	g	three inch 
0:54:21	0:54:25	g	what 
0:54:42	0:54:49	g	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
0:56:18	0:56:27	f	ok 
0:56:30	0:56:32	f	and curve down to the leave 
0:56:57	0:57:6	g	and then IY come to a savannah 
0:57:54	0:58:1	g	ok 
0:59:18	0:59:27	g	to the right 
0:59:50	0:59:52	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
1:6:58	1:7:0	g	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
1:7:53	1:7:56	g	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
1:9:2	1:9:4	f	yeah 
1:10:49	1:10:50	g	no IY don have any rock 
1:12:34	1:12:38	g	to the white mountain 
1:13:1	1:13:9	g	ok and then IY go 
1:14:24	1:14:28	f	mm Hmm 
1:14:55	1:14:59	g	but 
1:17:57	1:18:6	g	so that about IY would say 
1:18:49	1:18:55	f	ok 
1:19:11	1:19:18	f	mm Hmm 
1:19:21	1:19:25	g	after IY go straight again 
1:23:13	1:23:18	g	ok 
1:23:16	1:23:19	g	ok 
1:25:15	1:25:20	f	IY three inch above the savannah 
1:27:6	1:27:12	f	ok 
1:27:33	1:27:42	g	uhm 
1:28:0	1:28:6	g	probably the same thing 
1:28:26	1:28:28	g	uhm 
1:28:37	1:28:43	g	and then IY slope up 
1:30:38	1:30:40	g	to the leave 
1:34:13	1:34:20	g	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
1:34:36	1:34:45	g	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
1:35:0	1:35:8	g	what 
1:35:18	1:35:23	g	that little slope 
1:36:13	1:36:15	g	maybe 
1:36:43	1:36:46	f	how many inch do IY think 
1:37:1	1:37:2	g	IY start 
1:38:25	1:38:25	f	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
1:38:26	1:38:31	g	yes 
1:40:9	1:40:10	g	IY at the plane crash 
1:42:50	1:42:50	f	IY have to back up a little bit 
1:43:37	1:43:46	g	plane crash 
1:44:18	1:44:21	g	an inch maybe a little bit less 
1:44:19	1:44:25	g	just do it like this ok 
1:47:44	1:47:46	g	uhm 
1:51:15	1:51:23	f	to the leave of the antelope 
1:51:25	1:51:33	f	mm Hmm 
1:51:45	1:51:49	g	do IY have roman bath 
1:52:29	1:52:30	g	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
1:54:1	1:54:5	f	yeah IY see 
1:54:23	1:54:28	f	around the top of the lake 
1:55:16	1:55:19	f	IY know IY have different thing so 
1:56:12	1:56:19	g	ok 
1:56:33	1:56:33	f	yeah 
1:57:17	1:57:25	g	uhm 
1:57:48	1:57:52	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
1:58:0	1:58:7	g	uhm 
1:59:58	2:0:2	f	yeah 
2:1:48	2:1:57	g	and then 
2:2:52	2:2:55	g	three inch 
2:4:2	2:4:5	g	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
2:5:41	2:5:43	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish 
2:7:32	2:7:41	g	ok 
2:7:44	2:7:51	g	that about five or six inch 
2:11:45	2:11:51	g	uhm 
2:12:27	2:12:29	f	ok 
2:13:13	2:13:21	g	slight 
2:17:16	2:17:18	g	no there no elephant 
2:17:25	2:17:32	f	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
2:17:54	2:17:55	g	uhm 
2:19:35	2:19:40	f	yeah 
2:20:15	2:20:20	g	IY get 
2:21:8	2:21:17	g	alright be IY start near the 
2:24:1	2:24:6	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
2:28:36	2:28:40	f	to 
2:30:27	2:30:33	g	maybe like 
2:32:36	2:32:43	g	ok

2:34:22	2:34:29	g	uhm 
2:35:50	2:35:57	g	like four or five inch to the leave 
2:36:59	2:37:6	g	ok IY at the savannah 
2:37:30	2:37:35	g	five 
2:39:32	2:39:33	f	IY hit some rock though 
2:40:26	2:40:31	g	ok 
2:41:19	2:41:22	g	uhm and there be a stony desert 
2:42:52	2:43:1	f	to the leave 
2:43:21	2:43:24	g	IY make 
2:43:28	2:43:31	g	ok 
2:45:40	2:45:43	g	kind of across from stony desert 
2:53:7	2:53:15	g	not right at the stony desert 
2:54:47	2:54:51	f	do IY go through anything 
2:54:46	2:54:53	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
2:55:2	2:55:4	f	yeah 
2:55:27	2:55:28	g	a quarter of an inch 
2:55:33	2:55:39	f	ok 
2:56:18	2:56:25	g	couple inch IY slope down 
2:56:35	2:56:39	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
2:56:52	2:57:1	g	and then IY slope 
2:59:18	2:59:20	g	well just 
2:59:24	2:59:32	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
3:1:6	3:1:11	g	like three inch 
3:2:46	3:2:49	g	IY wanna kind of curve 
3:3:10	3:3:16	g	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
3:4:9	3:4:16	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
3:4:24	3:4:28	g	ok 
3:7:9	3:7:18	g	be IY anywhere near there 
3:8:54	3:9:3	g	IY slope down again 
3:11:29	3:11:35	g	ok 
3:12:41	3:12:46	g	ok

3:14:1	3:14:6	f	ok 
3:14:28	3:14:32	g	now IY at the collapse shelter 
3:14:41	3:14:45	g	four or five inch to the leave 
3:15:12	3:15:15	g	IY 
3:15:41	3:15:49	f	nope 
3:17:25	3:17:29	g	to the lake 
3:18:8	3:18:8	g	after the circle 
3:18:13	3:18:21	g	so IY make circle 
3:19:12	3:19:20	g	ok well 
3:20:32	3:20:40	f	mm Hmm 
3:20:41	3:20:42	f	ok 
3:21:57	3:21:57	f	plane crash IY don think be yeah 
3:22:5	3:22:10	f	elephant 
3:22:33	3:22:33	g	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
3:26:11	3:26:17	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
3:26:50	3:26:51	g	the 
3:27:12	3:27:17	f	ok 
3:29:28	3:29:28	g	be IY anywere near there 
3:29:28	3:29:36	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
3:30:7	3:30:14	g	ok 
3:32:4	3:32:11	g	uh like 
3:32:59	3:33:0	f	mm mm

3:40:52	3:41:1	f	and to the right 
3:41:46	3:41:50	g	maybe like 
3:41:52	3:41:53	f	ok 
3:42:35	3:42:41	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
3:42:43	3:42:48	g	so anyway 
3:43:20	3:43:21	f	no IY go with hot spring IY have 
3:46:36	3:46:36	f	IY start yeah the stony desert 
3:47:3	3:47:11	f	up tp the right 
3:52:54	3:53:3	g	alright 
3:54:18	3:54:22	f	ok

3:55:34	3:55:42	g	ok 
3:57:18	3:57:26	f	IY a plane crash though 
3:57:23	3:57:29	g	IY start at the stony desert 
3:58:26	3:58:29	g	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
3:58:37	3:58:40	g	alright 
3:58:41	3:58:46	f	yeah and IY go straight up 
4:0:34	4:0:36	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
4:1:37	4:1:44	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY just ok 
4:2:34	4:2:36	g	a little 
4:3:7	4:3:7	g	like IY slope 
4:4:41	4:4:45	f	and

4:10:10	4:10:11	g	and then IY you go up 
4:10:53	4:11:1	g	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
4:11:25	4:11:29	g	and slope be about an inch long 
4:13:2	4:13:6	f	and there a collapse shelter 
4:15:5	4:15:10	f	ok 
4:15:52	4:15:53	g	be IY 
4:16:20	4:16:25	g	no IY have

4:17:38	4:17:39	g	well alright 
4:18:41	4:18:46	g	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
4:18:51	4:18:55	g	no 
4:19:1	4:19:5	g	to right 
4:20:13	4:20:21	g	just a slight slope 
4:22:54	4:22:55	f	and then what 
4:25:21	4:25:24	g	so IY go three inch straight 
4:26:40	4:26:45	g	IY just kind of slope down 
4:27:4	4:27:9	g	ok well 
4:32:1	4:32:2	g	uhm 
4:34:13	4:34:16	g	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
4:34:26	4:34:27	g	alright alright well just 
4:34:39	4:34:43	g	ok 
4:35:50	4:35:51	g	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
4:37:7	4:37:7	f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
4:37:46	4:37:51	g	about like 
4:42:29	4:42:38	f	oh 
4:43:48	4:43:49	g	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
4:43:53	4:43:53	g	well 
4:44:7	4:44:14	f	do IY go around it 
4:44:53	4:44:56	g	and 
4:45:14	4:45:16	g	uhm IY straighten out slope 
4:45:27	4:45:27	g	and then IY be 
4:45:34	4:45:38	g	ok 
4:46:1	4:46:10	g	uhm 
4:47:34	4:47:39	g	a little bit too 
4:48:45	4:48:50	g	IY slope 
4:48:52	4:48:53	g	and then IY go straight 
4:49:53	4:49:53	g	for like 
4:51:1	4:51:4	g	and be to the leave 
4:54:41	4:54:49	g	uhhh no 
4:55:40	4:55:40	f	it not like in the same place IY describe 
4:56:13	4:56:15	g	Hmm

5:6:31	5:6:36	g	uhm 
5:8:2	5:8:7	g	and then 
5:8:53	5:8:57	f	IY plane crash IY be talk about earlier that up there 
5:10:34	5:10:36	g	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
5:11:6	5:11:6	g	ok 
5:11:2	5:11:10	g	and 
5:11:25	5:11:31	g	so IY at the hot spring 
5:12:38	5:12:38	f	but that like five six inch from where IY be now 
5:12:40	5:12:40	f	yeah 
5:13:35	5:13:40	g	ok 
5:13:53	5:14:1	g	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
5:14:9	5:14:10	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
5:15:8	5:15:10	f	around the lake to the top 
5:17:1	5:17:2	g	after plane crash 
5:17:24	5:17:30	g	the slate mountain be towards the right 
5:21:36	5:21:43	g	so 
5:21:57	5:22:0	g	and IY go straight up 
5:22:27	5:22:27	g	have a s 
5:26:6	5:26:10	f	ok 
5:26:10	5:26:15	g	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
5:28:12	5:28:21	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
5:28:55	5:29:4	g	ok plane crash isn there 
5:30:14	5:30:22	g	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
5:30:27	5:30:34	g	and IY go 
5:30:32	5:30:35	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
5:34:22	5:34:30	g	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
5:35:7	5:35:11	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
5:35:55	5:35:55	g	and then IY go down 
5:36:5	5:36:12	g	for like 
5:36:22	5:36:31	g	and 
5:38:39	5:38:41	g	yes IY go towards the lake 
5:39:4	5:39:4	g	uhm 
5:40:1	5:40:3	g	IY move to the leave 
5:39:56	5:40:4	g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
5:40:45	5:40:50	g	and then IY slope down to the leave 
5:40:52	5:40:58	g	where IY go down to a plane crash 
5:42:4	5:42:5	g	maybe four inch on the paper 
5:43:11	5:43:12	g	ok 
5:43:31	5:43:32	f	ok 
5:44:15	5:44:16	f	yeah

5:45:56	5:46:3	g	IY actually start like right 
5:46:29	5:46:33	g	and there a plane crash 
5:46:37	5:46:39	g	three inch straight across 
5:46:49	5:46:55	f	ok
