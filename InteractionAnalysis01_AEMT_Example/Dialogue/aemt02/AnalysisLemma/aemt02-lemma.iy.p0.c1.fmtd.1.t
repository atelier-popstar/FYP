5	1:5:23	1:5:30	uhm 
6	1:5:30	1:5:34	kind of across from stony desert 
7	1:5:34	1:7:16	and 
8	1:7:16	1:8:57	IY kind of go 
9	1:8:57	1:10:22	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
10	1:10:22	1:11:3	and IY go 
11	1:11:3	1:12:29	IY would say 
12	1:12:29	1:13:5	maybe 
13	1:13:5	1:14:23	couple mile or something 
14	1:14:23	1:14:50	from 
15	1:14:50	1:14:55	uhm 
16	1:14:55	1:16:17	where IY go down to a plane crash 
17	1:16:17	1:16:31	uhm 
18	1:16:31	1:18:27	there a there 
20	1:18:47	1:20:36	ok 
22	1:20:41	1:22:19	ok 
23	1:22:19	1:23:51	so IY start and there a stony desert right across from where IY start 
25	1:24:39	1:26:9	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
26	1:26:9	1:27:1	and then 
27	1:27:1	1:27:1	uhm 
28	1:27:1	1:28:57	IY just kind of slope down 
29	1:28:57	1:29:51	a little bit too 
30	1:29:51	1:30:42	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
31	1:30:42	1:32:7	after IY slope down IY say 
32	1:32:7	1:33:43	like 
33	1:33:43	1:35:17	maybe like 
34	1:35:17	1:36:56	couple inch IY slope down 
35	1:36:56	1:37:29	and then IY go straight 
36	1:37:29	1:39:26	for like 
37	1:39:26	1:40:43	like 
38	1:40:43	1:41:43	five 
39	1:41:43	1:43:11	maybe four inch on the paper 
40	1:43:11	1:44:0	and there a plane crash 
45	1:46:4	1:47:18	plane crash 
47	1:49:9	1:50:2	uhm 
48	1:50:2	1:51:19	alright be IY start near the 
50	1:52:24	1:52:29	be IY 
51	1:52:29	1:54:11	IY start at the stony desert 
53	1:55:30	1:55:42	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
55	1:56:49	1:57:35	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
56	1:57:35	1:58:10	not right at the stony desert 
58	1:59:35	2:0:30	ok and then IY go 
60	2:1:43	2:1:43	to the leave 
61	2:1:43	2:2:49	like an inch 
62	2:2:49	2:3:44	and then IY go down 
63	2:3:44	2:3:53	like maybe an inch 
64	2:3:53	2:4:16	that little slope 
66	2:4:43	2:5:55	and then IY go 
67	2:5:55	2:6:13	like four or five inch to the leave 
68	2:6:13	2:6:25	and that where the plane crash be 
69	2:6:25	2:7:43	be IY anywhere near there 
72	2:11:3	2:12:33	four or five inch to the leave 
74	2:12:34	2:12:42	and then 
75	2:12:42	2:14:14	after plane crash 
78	2:15:29	2:17:14	ok plane crash isn there 
79	2:17:14	2:18:2	uhm 
80	2:18:2	2:19:29	alright well IY keep go and see 
81	2:19:29	2:19:53	alright 
82	2:19:53	2:20:5	so 
83	2:20:5	2:21:15	uhm 
84	2:21:15	2:22:2	IY at the plane crash 
85	2:22:2	2:22:58	and 
86	2:22:58	2:24:34	IY wanna kind of curve 
87	2:24:34	2:25:8	a little 
88	2:25:8	2:26:33	to the leave 
89	2:26:33	2:26:59	and then IY you go up 
90	2:26:59	2:28:16	and IY go up like 
91	2:28:16	2:30:11	three inch 
93	2:31:13	2:32:14	and 
94	2:32:14	2:32:58	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve 
95	2:32:58	2:34:43	it not a big curve 
97	2:36:12	2:36:53	ok 
98	2:36:53	2:38:10	and then 
99	2:38:10	2:38:23	uhm 
100	2:38:23	2:38:40	after IY go straight again 
101	2:38:40	2:40:25	away about like four inch four or five inch 
102	2:40:25	2:42:11	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
103	2:42:11	2:43:7	be IY anywere near there 
105	2:43:33	2:44:29	ok 
107	2:45:0	2:46:55	yes 
109	2:47:43	2:47:44	yes 
111	2:48:40	2:50:15	ok 
112	2:50:15	2:52:11	now IY at the collapse shelter 
113	2:52:11	2:52:18	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
114	2:52:18	2:52:21	just a slight slope 
115	2:52:21	2:53:16	about like 
116	2:53:16	2:54:37	an inch maybe a little bit less 
118	2:55:15	2:57:1	to the right 
119	2:57:1	2:57:39	IY slope 
122	2:59:35	3:0:24	ok 
123	3:0:24	3:1:58	and then 
124	3:1:58	3:2:15	IY 
125	3:2:15	3:2:18	have a s 
126	3:2:18	3:3:17	IY go like straight for about three inch but it like a s 
127	3:3:17	3:3:23	it like a slight little upwards to the right 
129	3:3:23	3:5:2	slight 
130	3:5:2	3:5:2	uhm 
131	3:5:2	3:6:59	and then IY come to a savannah 
133	3:7:2	3:7:40	ok 
135	3:8:11	3:9:25	uhhh no 
136	3:9:25	3:11:2	no IY don have a waterhole 
137	3:11:2	3:11:29	IY have a waterhole on map 
139	3:11:54	3:13:45	well 
140	3:13:45	3:14:41	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
142	3:14:41	3:16:25	ok 
144	3:17:45	3:17:53	ok IY at the savannah 
145	3:17:53	3:19:24	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
146	3:19:24	3:20:27	like 
147	3:20:27	3:21:48	three inch 
149	3:22:27	3:23:10	and IY go straight up 
150	3:23:10	3:23:55	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
152	3:25:19	3:26:33	ok well 
153	3:26:33	3:27:50	probably the same thing 
156	3:29:50	3:31:43	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
158	3:32:10	3:32:59	straight up 
160	3:34:14	3:34:22	Hmm 
161	3:34:22	3:35:0	well 
162	3:35:0	3:35:33	IY don know 
163	3:35:33	3:37:11	alright 
164	3:37:11	3:37:44	well just 
166	3:38:43	3:40:24	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
167	3:40:24	3:41:51	the slate mountain be towards the right 
168	3:41:51	3:43:15	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
169	3:43:15	3:44:47	be IY in like 
170	3:44:47	3:45:8	be IY in like almost the top of the 
172	3:46:11	3:46:46	no IY have 
173	3:46:46	3:47:14	maybe IY have different thing 
174	3:47:14	3:48:12	well alright 
176	3:49:38	3:51:21	alright alright well just 
177	3:51:21	3:51:38	just do it like this ok 
178	3:51:38	3:53:11	go up like three three and a half inch 
180	3:53:21	3:54:42	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
182	3:54:47	3:55:51	it right next to it 
183	3:55:51	3:56:12	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
185	3:57:56	3:58:25	maybe like 
186	3:58:25	3:59:24	a quarter of an inch 
187	3:59:24	4:0:23	to the leave of little path where path should be 
190	4:0:50	4:2:17	ok 
191	4:2:17	4:3:21	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
192	4:3:21	4:3:59	for like 
193	4:3:59	4:4:55	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
195	4:6:51	4:7:14	and then IY slope down to the leave 
196	4:7:14	4:7:44	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
198	4:9:8	4:10:4	ok 
199	4:10:4	4:11:38	and then 
200	4:11:38	4:12:1	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
202	4:13:4	4:14:46	ok 
203	4:14:46	4:15:34	so IY at the hot spring 
204	4:15:34	4:16:46	and IY slope to the leave 
205	4:16:46	4:18:32	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
207	4:19:51	4:21:10	ok 
208	4:21:10	4:22:54	and then 
209	4:22:54	4:24:43	uhm 
210	4:24:43	4:24:56	IY slope down again 
212	4:25:41	4:26:17	uhm 
213	4:26:17	4:26:17	no there no elephant 
214	4:26:17	4:27:49	on sheet anyway 
217	4:29:27	4:30:3	no 
218	4:30:3	4:30:58	IY just go down 
219	4:30:58	4:32:25	like IY slope 
220	4:32:25	4:33:0	and slope be about an inch long 
221	4:33:0	4:34:30	and be to the leave 
223	4:35:11	4:36:40	ok 
224	4:36:40	4:37:20	and then 
225	4:37:20	4:37:55	uhm 
226	4:37:55	4:38:16	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
227	4:38:16	4:38:51	to the leave 
229	4:40:37	4:42:6	ok 
230	4:42:6	4:42:36	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
232	4:43:5	4:44:1	to the white mountain 
234	4:45:16	4:45:22	ok 
235	4:45:22	4:46:59	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
236	4:46:59	4:48:17	and it slope a little bit to the right 
237	4:48:17	4:50:11	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
239	4:50:22	4:50:36	ok 
240	4:50:36	4:51:17	so that about IY would say 
241	4:51:17	4:53:7	that about five or six inch 
243	4:53:48	4:54:10	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
245	4:55:10	4:55:28	uhm IY straighten out slope 
246	4:55:28	4:56:11	and IY just go straight up 
247	4:56:11	4:58:6	for about two inch 
248	4:58:6	4:59:37	ok 
250	4:59:50	5:0:21	then 
252	5:2:19	5:3:46	no IY don have any rock 
254	5:5:22	5:6:40	ok 
256	5:6:40	5:8:1	ok 
257	5:8:1	5:9:0	uhm 
258	5:9:0	5:9:9	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
259	5:9:9	5:9:41	and then IY slope 
260	5:9:41	5:10:50	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
262	5:11:57	5:12:59	yes IY go towards the lake 
264	5:14:33	5:16:10	but 
265	5:16:10	5:17:18	IY go about 
266	5:17:18	5:18:50	three inch straight across 
267	5:18:50	5:20:37	to the lake 
268	5:20:37	5:21:54	and then IY be 
269	5:21:54	5:23:37	IY get 
271	5:24:41	5:25:40	uhm 
272	5:25:40	5:26:16	no 
273	5:26:16	5:27:21	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
274	5:27:21	5:27:25	so IY go three inch straight 
275	5:27:25	5:29:5	and then IY slope up 
276	5:29:5	5:29:22	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
278	5:29:26	5:29:40	the 
279	5:29:40	5:31:33	what 
281	5:33:20	5:33:32	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
283	5:35:15	5:36:4	ok 
284	5:36:4	5:37:7	and then 
285	5:37:7	5:37:37	uhm 
286	5:37:37	5:38:17	right next to circle should be roman bath 
287	5:38:17	5:40:9	do IY have roman bath 
289	5:41:56	5:42:7	ok well 
290	5:42:7	5:43:30	they there 
291	5:43:30	5:44:20	so anyway 
292	5:44:20	5:45:29	IY make 
294	5:46:6	5:47:36	what 
296	5:48:39	5:50:0	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
297	5:50:0	5:50:52	so IY make circle 
300	5:52:53	5:53:27	and 
301	5:53:27	5:54:39	after the circle 
302	5:54:39	5:55:5	uhm 
303	5:55:5	5:55:42	IY move to the leave 
304	5:55:42	5:56:0	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
306	5:57:35	5:58:23	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
307	5:58:23	5:58:31	like three inch 
308	5:58:31	5:59:5	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
310	6:0:37	6:1:18	ok 
311	6:1:18	6:2:55	IY go straight down 
312	6:2:55	6:3:49	uh like 
313	6:3:49	6:5:48	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
316	6:7:59	6:9:28	uhm 
318	6:10:38	6:10:40	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
320	6:12:12	6:12:44	be the plane crash 
321	6:12:44	6:12:45	like 
322	6:12:45	6:13:42	to right 
325	6:16:3	6:16:55	yes yeah IY just don even go near there 
327	6:17:26	6:17:28	IY go like 
329	6:17:57	6:18:11	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
330	6:18:11	6:20:2	and IY should have a straight line there 
333	6:21:35	6:23:30	ok 
334	6:23:30	6:24:25	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
336	6:25:23	6:25:51	around the bottom of it 
338	6:26:39	6:27:5	ok 
340	6:27:43	6:28:13	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and that the finish

70	2:7:43	2:9:35	plane crash be on the other side but IY just ok 
71	2:9:35	2:11:3	so four or five inch and then there a plane crash 
73	2:12:33	2:12:34	ok 
76	2:14:14	2:14:43	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
77	2:14:43	2:15:29	ok

108	2:46:55	2:47:43	and there a collapse shelter 
110	2:47:44	2:48:40	ok 
117	2:54:37	2:55:15	to the right 
120	2:57:39	2:57:41	ok

8	1:7:16	1:8:57	IY kind of go 
9	1:8:57	1:10:22	IY kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
10	1:10:22	1:11:3	and IY go 
11	1:11:3	1:12:29	IY would say 
12	1:12:29	1:13:5	maybe

30	1:29:51	1:30:42	and IY slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
31	1:30:42	1:32:7	after IY slope down IY say 
32	1:32:7	1:33:43	like 
33	1:33:43	1:35:17	maybe like 
34	1:35:17	1:36:56	couple inch IY slope down

37	1:39:26	1:40:43	like 
38	1:40:43	1:41:43	five 
39	1:41:43	1:43:11	maybe four inch on the paper 
40	1:43:11	1:44:0	and there a plane crash 
45	1:46:4	1:47:18	plane crash 
47	1:49:9	1:50:2	uhm 
48	1:50:2	1:51:19	alright be IY start near the 
50	1:52:24	1:52:29	be IY 
51	1:52:29	1:54:11	IY start at the stony desert 
53	1:55:30	1:55:42	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
55	1:56:49	1:57:35	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
56	1:57:35	1:58:10	not right at the stony desert 
58	1:59:35	2:0:30	ok and then IY go 
60	2:1:43	2:1:43	to the leave 
61	2:1:43	2:2:49	like an inch 
62	2:2:49	2:3:44	and then IY go down 
63	2:3:44	2:3:53	like maybe an inch 
64	2:3:53	2:4:16	that little slope 
66	2:4:43	2:5:55	and then IY go 
67	2:5:55	2:6:13	like four or five inch to the leave 
68	2:6:13	2:6:25	and that where the plane crash be 
69	2:6:25	2:7:43	be IY anywhere near there 
72	2:11:3	2:12:33	four or five inch to the leave 
74	2:12:34	2:12:42	and then 
75	2:12:42	2:14:14	after plane crash 
78	2:15:29	2:17:14	ok plane crash isn there 
79	2:17:14	2:18:2	uhm 
80	2:18:2	2:19:29	alright well IY keep go and see 
81	2:19:29	2:19:53	alright

83	2:20:5	2:21:15	uhm 
84	2:21:15	2:22:2	IY at the plane crash 
85	2:22:2	2:22:58	and 
86	2:22:58	2:24:34	IY wanna kind of curve 
87	2:24:34	2:25:8	a little 
88	2:25:8	2:26:33	to the leave 
89	2:26:33	2:26:59	and then IY you go up 
90	2:26:59	2:28:16	and IY go up like 
91	2:28:16	2:30:11	three inch 
93	2:31:13	2:32:14	and 
94	2:32:14	2:32:58	in those three inch IY kind of curve to te right but it a slight curve

97	2:36:12	2:36:53	ok 
98	2:36:53	2:38:10	and then 
99	2:38:10	2:38:23	uhm

101	2:38:40	2:40:25	away about like four inch four or five inch 
102	2:40:25	2:42:11	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
103	2:42:11	2:43:7	be IY anywere near there 
105	2:43:33	2:44:29	ok 
107	2:45:0	2:46:55	yes

111	2:48:40	2:50:15	ok 
112	2:50:15	2:52:11	now IY at the collapse shelter 
113	2:52:11	2:52:18	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
114	2:52:18	2:52:21	just a slight slope 
115	2:52:21	2:53:16	about like 
116	2:53:16	2:54:37	an inch maybe a little bit less 
118	2:55:15	2:57:1	to the right 
119	2:57:1	2:57:39	IY slope 
122	2:59:35	3:0:24	ok 
123	3:0:24	3:1:58	and then

144	3:17:45	3:17:53	ok IY at the savannah 
145	3:17:53	3:19:24	now IY curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
146	3:19:24	3:20:27	like 
147	3:20:27	3:21:48	three inch 
149	3:22:27	3:23:10	and IY go straight up 
150	3:23:10	3:23:55	and then IY curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
152	3:25:19	3:26:33	ok well 
153	3:26:33	3:27:50	probably the same thing 
156	3:29:50	3:31:43	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
158	3:32:10	3:32:59	straight up 
160	3:34:14	3:34:22	Hmm 
161	3:34:22	3:35:0	well

164	3:37:11	3:37:44	well just 
166	3:38:43	3:40:24	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY way up there IY shouldn be over there 
167	3:40:24	3:41:51	the slate mountain be towards the right 
168	3:41:51	3:43:15	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
169	3:43:15	3:44:47	be IY in like 
170	3:44:47	3:45:8	be IY in like almost the top of the 
172	3:46:11	3:46:46	no IY have 
173	3:46:46	3:47:14	maybe IY have different thing 
174	3:47:14	3:48:12	well alright 
176	3:49:38	3:51:21	alright alright well just 
177	3:51:21	3:51:38	just do it like this ok 
178	3:51:38	3:53:11	go up like three three and a half inch 
180	3:53:21	3:54:42	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
182	3:54:47	3:55:51	it right next to it 
183	3:55:51	3:56:12	it like right there like where little path be it right to the leave of it 
185	3:57:56	3:58:25	maybe like 
186	3:58:25	3:59:24	a quarter of an inch 
187	3:59:24	4:0:23	to the leave of little path where path should be 
190	4:0:50	4:2:17	ok 
191	4:2:17	4:3:21	and then so IY curve to the leave and IY go straight 
192	4:3:21	4:3:59	for like 
193	4:3:59	4:4:55	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
195	4:6:51	4:7:14	and then IY slope down to the leave 
196	4:7:14	4:7:44	and slope be about two inch it like a two inch slope 
198	4:9:8	4:10:4	ok 
199	4:10:4	4:11:38	and then 
200	4:11:38	4:12:1	as IY slope down IY come to hot well do IY have hot well 
202	4:13:4	4:14:46	ok 
203	4:14:46	4:15:34	so IY at the hot spring 
204	4:15:34	4:16:46	and IY slope to the leave 
205	4:16:46	4:18:32	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY go by the hot well 
207	4:19:51	4:21:10	ok 
208	4:21:10	4:22:54	and then 
209	4:22:54	4:24:43	uhm 
210	4:24:43	4:24:56	IY slope down again 
212	4:25:41	4:26:17	uhm 
213	4:26:17	4:26:17	no there no elephant 
214	4:26:17	4:27:49	on sheet anyway 
217	4:29:27	4:30:3	no 
218	4:30:3	4:30:58	IY just go down 
219	4:30:58	4:32:25	like IY slope 
220	4:32:25	4:33:0	and slope be about an inch long 
221	4:33:0	4:34:30	and be to the leave 
223	4:35:11	4:36:40	ok 
224	4:36:40	4:37:20	and then 
225	4:37:20	4:37:55	uhm 
226	4:37:55	4:38:16	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
227	4:38:16	4:38:51	to the leave 
229	4:40:37	4:42:6	ok 
230	4:42:6	4:42:36	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it not really gradual it kinda like a steep slope up 
232	4:43:5	4:44:1	to the white mountain 
234	4:45:16	4:45:22	ok 
235	4:45:22	4:46:59	so it a kinda like a grad not a gradual it a steep slope 
236	4:46:59	4:48:17	and it slope a little bit to the right 
237	4:48:17	4:50:11	but it like a slight slope to the right as IY go up but it steep 
239	4:50:22	4:50:36	ok 
240	4:50:36	4:51:17	so that about IY would say 
241	4:51:17	4:53:7	that about five or six inch 
243	4:53:48	4:54:10	ok and then as IY pass the white mountain 
245	4:55:10	4:55:28	uhm IY straighten out slope 
246	4:55:28	4:56:11	and IY just go straight up 
247	4:56:11	4:58:6	for about two inch 
248	4:58:6	4:59:37	ok 
250	4:59:50	5:0:21	then 
252	5:2:19	5:3:46	no IY don have any rock 
254	5:5:22	5:6:40	ok 
256	5:6:40	5:8:1	ok 
257	5:8:1	5:9:0	uhm 
258	5:9:0	5:9:9	and then IY up straight and IY go the two inch 
259	5:9:9	5:9:41	and then IY slope 
260	5:9:41	5:10:50	well IY don really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it a just a turn 
262	5:11:57	5:12:59	yes IY go towards the lake 
264	5:14:33	5:16:10	but 
265	5:16:10	5:17:18	IY go about 
266	5:17:18	5:18:50	three inch straight across 
267	5:18:50	5:20:37	to the lake 
268	5:20:37	5:21:54	and then IY be 
269	5:21:54	5:23:37	IY get 
271	5:24:41	5:25:40	uhm 
272	5:25:40	5:26:16	no 
273	5:26:16	5:27:21	IY not through anything yet IY go actually around the lake 
274	5:27:21	5:27:25	so IY go three inch straight 
275	5:27:25	5:29:5	and then IY slope up 
276	5:29:5	5:29:22	and IY go around the lake and the lake kinda like in a s 
278	5:29:26	5:29:40	the 
279	5:29:40	5:31:33	what 
281	5:33:20	5:33:32	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
283	5:35:15	5:36:4	ok 
284	5:36:4	5:37:7	and then 
285	5:37:7	5:37:37	uhm 
286	5:37:37	5:38:17	right next to circle should be roman bath 
287	5:38:17	5:40:9	do IY have roman bath 
289	5:41:56	5:42:7	ok well 
290	5:42:7	5:43:30	they there 
291	5:43:30	5:44:20	so anyway

294	5:46:6	5:47:36	what 
296	5:48:39	5:50:0	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
297	5:50:0	5:50:52	so IY make circle 
300	5:52:53	5:53:27	and 
301	5:53:27	5:54:39	after the circle 
302	5:54:39	5:55:5	uhm 
303	5:55:5	5:55:42	IY move to the leave 
304	5:55:42	5:56:0	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
306	5:57:35	5:58:23	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
307	5:58:23	5:58:31	like three inch 
308	5:58:31	5:59:5	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
310	6:0:37	6:1:18	ok 
311	6:1:18	6:2:55	IY go straight down 
312	6:2:55	6:3:49	uh like
