start
start g
1	0:1:8	0:1:9	IY just kind of slope down 
3	0:6:1	0:6:2	maybe 
7	0:10:41	0:10:41	ok 
8	0:11:19	0:11:19	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
9	0:11:32	0:11:40	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
10	0:11:38	0:11:41	IY have a waterhole on map 
12	0:14:27	0:14:35	and IY should have a straight line there 
14	0:15:23	0:15:28	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
16	0:18:56	0:19:2	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
20	0:24:20	0:24:23	and slope be about an inch long 
21	0:24:36	0:24:40	IY be start at the stony desert 
22	0:24:50	0:24:58	IY move to the leave 
24	0:27:3	0:27:3	ok 
28	0:29:48	0:29:54	after plane crash 
29	0:34:5	0:34:13	hmm 
30	0:37:25	0:37:25	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
31	0:37:47	0:37:48	for like 
32	0:38:32	0:38:32	and then 
34	0:39:4	0:39:13	 about five or six inch 
37	0:41:40	0:41:44	alright well IY will keep go and see 
39	0:42:47	0:42:48	and IY be slope to the leave 
40	0:43:41	0:43:45	yes 
42	0:49:29	0:49:29	four or five inch to the leave 
43	0:51:46	0:51:55	ok 
44	0:52:23	0:52:32	it  not a big curve 
47	0:54:51	0:54:52	so anyway 
49	0:56:22	0:56:29	IY make 
50	0:56:32	0:56:35	so IY make circle 
52	0:56:39	0:56:44	and then IY be 
53	0:57:14	0:57:22	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
56	1:0:51	1:0:54	from 
57	1:2:5	1:2:6	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
58	1:2:49	1:2:52	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
59	1:3:13	1:3:15	and then 
61	1:4:19	1:4:24	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
62	1:5:4	1:5:5	and then IY will come to a savannah 
63	1:8:9	1:8:16	for about two inch 
64	1:8:21	1:8:25	and IY be go up like 
65	1:14:25	1:14:28	and then IY you go up 
67	1:15:1	1:15:10	IY slope down again 
68	1:15:58	1:16:2	and 
69	1:17:29	1:17:33	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
70	1:19:8	1:19:12	have a s 
71	1:19:38	1:19:46	to the lake 
72	1:20:41	1:20:50	IY be kind of go 
73	1:21:35	1:21:43	ok plane crash be n there 
76	1:27:32	1:27:39	slight 
77	1:30:41	1:30:42	straight up 
78	1:31:3	1:31:6	uhm 
79	1:32:37	1:32:44	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
80	1:32:41	1:32:48	kind of across from stony desert 
81	1:34:6	1:34:7	and there  a plane crash 
82	1:38:36	1:38:38	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
83	1:48:11	1:48:18	after IY go straight again 
84	1:49:27	1:49:29	and then IY slope up 
85	1:49:59	1:49:59	IY be go like 
86	1:53:7	1:53:11	ok 
88	1:54:13	1:54:17	well just 
89	1:55:42	1:55:48	ok 
91	1:57:48	1:57:51	be IY in like almost the top of the 
92	2:1:52	2:1:58	three inch straight across 
94	2:3:22	2:3:25	ok 
95	2:4:55	2:4:58	ok 
96	2:5:29	2:5:36	three inch 
99	2:12:46	2:12:46	what 
100	2:13:59	2:14:2	a little 
101	2:15:9	2:15:14	and then IY go 
102	2:16:20	2:16:20	and 
103	2:17:47	2:17:52	ok 
104	2:19:53	2:19:55	a quarter of an inch 
105	2:20:22	2:20:31	IY be actually start like right 
106	2:20:42	2:20:49	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
107	2:20:47	2:20:53	ok 
108	2:21:15	2:21:19	right next to circle should be roman bath 
111	2:22:28	2:22:37	and then 
112	2:23:54	2:23:57	IY wanna kind of curve 
113	2:25:55	2:26:3	and then 
114	2:27:15	2:27:16	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
115	2:28:25	2:28:32	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
116	2:29:4	2:29:11	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
117	2:29:19	2:29:24	the slate mountain be towards the right 
118	2:29:17	2:29:25	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
119	2:32:12	2:32:13	and  where the plane crash be 
120	2:33:55	2:34:2	uhm 
121	2:34:12	2:34:12	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
122	2:35:10	2:35:16	 little slope 
123	2:36:12	2:36:13	uhm 
124	2:36:13	2:36:14	IY be slope 
125	2:36:12	2:36:20	like four or five inch to the leave 
126	2:37:36	2:37:42	uhhh no 
127	2:38:53	2:38:57	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
128	2:40:31	2:40:34	uhm 
129	2:40:27	2:40:34	ok well 
130	2:40:45	2:40:47	on sheet anyway 
132	2:41:57	2:41:57	IY go straight down 
133	2:42:14	2:42:16	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
134	2:42:18	2:42:25	ok 
135	2:43:8	2:43:15	to the white mountain 
136	2:45:35	2:45:44	ok 
137	2:45:48	2:45:53	well 
138	2:45:51	2:45:54	and IY be go 
139	2:46:10	2:46:12	about like 
140	2:47:39	2:47:46	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
141	2:50:54	2:50:59	alright alright well just 
142	2:51:24	2:51:31	to the leave 
143	2:51:59	2:52:4	away about like four inch four or five inch 
144	2:52:17	2:52:18	couple mile or something 
146	2:53:34	2:53:38	uhm 
147	2:54:18	2:54:18	go up like three three and a half inch 
148	2:55:19	2:55:21	so  about IY would say 
149	2:56:27	2:56:33	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
150	2:58:24	2:58:29	then 
151	3:3:42	3:3:45	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
152	3:3:53	3:3:56	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
154	3:6:35	3:6:41	ok 
155	3:6:43	3:6:49	ok well 
156	3:7:20	3:7:28	uhm 
157	3:7:23	3:7:31	uhm and there be a stony desert 
159	3:8:49	3:8:49	IY 
160	3:8:45	3:8:53	an inch maybe a little bit less 
161	3:9:28	3:9:31	be IY anywhere near there 
162	3:11:32	3:11:38	not right at the stony desert 
163	3:13:20	3:13:27	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
164	3:13:42	3:13:46	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
165	3:14:14	3:14:21	IY be just go down 
166	3:14:46	3:14:50	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
167	3:16:4	3:16:5	IY be start 
169	3:19:47	3:19:50	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
170	3:20:6	3:20:10	like three inch 
172	3:22:22	3:22:22	for like 
174	3:25:40	3:25:42	uhm

180	3:31:0	3:31:8	maybe IY have different thing 
181	3:34:21	3:34:23	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
182	3:34:27	3:34:33	uhm 
184	3:37:4	3:37:8	three inch 
188	3:40:26	3:40:34	five

192	3:45:8	3:45:8	and be to the leave 
195	3:46:22	3:46:29	no IY do n have a waterhole 
196	3:51:10	3:51:11	and IY just go straight up 
197	3:51:16	3:51:17	so 
198	3:53:1	3:53:4	like an inch 
199	3:55:51	3:55:56	but 
202	3:57:24	3:57:32	ok and then IY be go 
204	4:1:41	4:1:50	maybe four inch on the paper 
205	4:4:0	4:4:9	ok 
206	4:4:29	4:4:38	no IY do n have any rock 
207	4:4:45	4:4:46	just a slight slope 
208	4:5:56	4:6:4	just do it like this ok 
209	4:6:29	4:6:31	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
211	4:9:0	4:9:3	ok 
213	4:9:59	4:9:59	to right 
214	4:11:29	4:11:38	uhm IY straighten out slope

221	4:24:23	4:24:24	and it slope a little bit to the right 
222	4:27:13	4:27:17	after the circle 
223	4:28:11	4:28:14	ok 
225	4:32:1	4:32:4	alright be IY start near the 
226	4:36:26	4:36:29	uhm

232	4:46:30	4:46:30	there  a there  
236	4:49:30	4:49:37	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
237	4:50:36	4:50:42	and then 
238	4:52:29	4:52:38	and then IY slope down to the leave 
239	4:52:45	4:52:48	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
240	4:56:26	4:56:27	ok 
241	4:56:40	4:56:42	like IY be slope 
243	4:58:22	4:58:29	maybe like 
244	4:59:12	4:59:20	plane crash 
246	5:0:36	5:0:38	alright 
247	5:4:47	5:4:52	IY would say 
251	5:10:32	5:10:38	uhm 
252	5:12:18	5:12:19	and 
253	5:12:45	5:12:52	couple inch IY be slope down

262	5:21:26	5:21:26	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
263	5:21:27	5:21:32	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
265	5:22:34	5:22:34	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
266	5:24:40	5:24:48	IY be at the plane crash 
268	5:24:52	5:25:0	like 
269	5:25:21	5:25:23	and then IY slope 
270	5:26:21	5:26:22	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
271	5:29:5	5:29:13	uhm 
272	5:29:40	5:29:47	no 
273	5:30:57	5:31:5	ok IY be at the savannah 
274	5:31:12	5:31:18	do IY have roman bath 
275	5:31:35	5:31:41	no IY have 
276	5:33:1	5:33:8	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
278	5:34:49	5:34:56	the 
279	5:36:0	5:36:4	no there  no elephant 
280	5:36:19	5:36:26	uh like 
281	5:36:20	5:36:27	to the leave 
282	5:37:4	5:37:7	ok 
283	5:37:49	5:37:51	probably the same thing 
284	5:39:27	5:39:28	IY do n know 
286	5:40:5	5:40:12	uhm 
289	5:42:41	5:42:46	yes IY be go towards the lake

293	5:45:11	5:45:16	uhm 
295	5:47:2	5:47:7	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
296	5:47:15	5:47:15	ok 
297	5:48:13	5:48:14	to the right 
298	5:49:32	5:49:38	around the bottom of it 
299	5:50:38	5:50:40	a little bit too 
303	5:54:47	5:54:48	well alright 
304	5:58:31	5:58:35	what 
305	6:0:56	6:0:56	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
307	6:5:19	6:5:25	be IY in like 
308	6:5:41	6:5:45	IY get 
309	6:6:17	6:6:25	be the plane crash 
310	6:7:31	6:7:34	and then 
311	6:7:56	6:8:0	to the leave of little path where path should be 
312	6:8:7	6:8:12	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
314	6:11:34	6:11:41	be IY 
315	6:14:28	6:14:36	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
316	6:18:31	6:18:31	like maybe an inch 
317	6:18:55	6:18:58	like 
318	6:21:3	6:21:9	so IY be at the hot spring 
320	6:21:59	6:22:1	to the leave 
322	6:23:45	6:23:45	no 
324	6:27:11	6:27:12	be IY anywere near there 
325	6:27:51	6:27:51	like 
326	6:29:59	6:30:6	and then IY go straight 
327	6:30:18	6:30:18	and then IY be go down 
328	6:30:20	6:30:29	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
329	6:30:51	6:30:56	and IY be go straight up 
330	6:30:47	6:30:56	ok 
331	6:31:58	6:32:1	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
332	6:32:26	6:32:31	uhm 
335	6:33:32	6:33:40	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
336	6:33:47	6:33:48	ok 
337	6:33:53	6:33:56	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
340	6:38:55	6:38:57	and then 
342	6:42:20	6:42:26	after IY slope down IY will say 
start f
0	0:0:18	0:0:23	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
2	0:3:59	0:4:3	ok 
4	0:6:54	0:6:57	IY be start yeah the stony desert 
5	0:6:55	0:6:58	ok 
6	0:10:20	0:10:21	yeah 
11	0:13:33	0:13:33	ok 
13	0:14:45	0:14:45	ok wait hold on 
15	0:16:31	0:16:33	IY have a plane crash though 
17	0:19:5	0:19:7	to the leave of the antelope 
18	0:24:14	0:24:15	ok 
19	0:24:13	0:24:22	ok 
23	0:26:27	0:26:31	to 
25	0:28:47	0:28:48	to the leave 
26	0:29:9	0:29:10	and 
27	0:29:26	0:29:35	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
33	0:38:36	0:38:44	ok 
35	0:40:2	0:40:9	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
36	0:41:2	0:41:6	yeah 
38	0:41:50	0:41:57	IY be three inch above the savannah 
41	0:47:32	0:47:32	ok 
45	0:53:10	0:53:14	but  like five six inch from where IY be now 
46	0:54:25	0:54:31	ok 
48	0:56:24	0:56:25	plane crash IY do n think be yeah 
51	0:56:38	0:56:40	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
54	0:59:13	0:59:17	so wait

60	1:3:20	1:3:27	ok 
66	1:14:45	1:14:45	and curve down to the leave 
74	1:21:52	1:21:52	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
75	1:24:35	1:24:35	to the right 
87	1:53:55	1:53:58	ok 
90	1:57:9	1:57:14	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
93	2:2:39	2:2:45	up tp the right 
97	2:7:12	2:7:16	yeah and IY go straight up 
98	2:12:5	2:12:13	uhm

145	2:52:24	2:52:32	nope 
153	3:6:29	3:6:29	so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
158	3:8:41	3:8:41	ok 
168	3:17:57	3:18:3	mm hmm 
171	3:20:20	3:20:25	mm hmm

194	3:46:27	3:46:27	ok 
200	3:56:16	3:56:25	do IY go by the plane crash 
201	3:56:43	3:56:51	mm hmm 
203	4:0:0	4:0:2	IY be at the savannah 
210	4:8:9	4:8:12	yeah

250	5:9:31	5:9:31	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
255	5:13:22	5:13:30	around the lake to the top 
259	5:19:31	5:19:34	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
260	5:19:28	5:19:37	mm mm 
264	5:21:59	5:22:0	and there  a collapse shelter 
267	5:24:57	5:24:59	ok 
277	5:33:45	5:33:46	yep 
285	5:39:31	5:39:40	yeah IY see

313	6:8:43	6:8:52	mm hmm 
319	6:21:23	6:21:27	IY have plane crash IY be talk about earlier  up there 
321	6:23:28	6:23:36	ok 
323	6:26:47	6:26:50	mm hmm 
333	6:32:38	6:32:41	ok 
334	6:33:7	6:33:12	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
338	6:34:59	6:35:2	yeah 
339	6:36:53	6:37:1	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
341	6:38:55	6:39:0	ok 
start g
1	0:1:8	0:1:9	IY just kind of slope down 
3	0:6:1	0:6:2	maybe 
7	0:10:41	0:10:41	ok 
8	0:11:19	0:11:19	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
9	0:11:32	0:11:40	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
10	0:11:38	0:11:41	IY have a waterhole on map 
12	0:14:27	0:14:35	and IY should have a straight line there 
14	0:15:23	0:15:28	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
16	0:18:56	0:19:2	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
20	0:24:20	0:24:23	and slope be about an inch long 
21	0:24:36	0:24:40	IY be start at the stony desert 
22	0:24:50	0:24:58	IY move to the leave 
24	0:27:3	0:27:3	ok 
28	0:29:48	0:29:54	after plane crash 
29	0:34:5	0:34:13	hmm 
30	0:37:25	0:37:25	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
31	0:37:47	0:37:48	for like 
32	0:38:32	0:38:32	and then 
34	0:39:4	0:39:13	 about five or six inch 
37	0:41:40	0:41:44	alright well IY will keep go and see 
39	0:42:47	0:42:48	and IY be slope to the leave 
40	0:43:41	0:43:45	yes 
42	0:49:29	0:49:29	four or five inch to the leave 
43	0:51:46	0:51:55	ok 
44	0:52:23	0:52:32	it  not a big curve 
47	0:54:51	0:54:52	so anyway 
49	0:56:22	0:56:29	IY make 
50	0:56:32	0:56:35	so IY make circle 
52	0:56:39	0:56:44	and then IY be 
53	0:57:14	0:57:22	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
56	1:0:51	1:0:54	from 
57	1:2:5	1:2:6	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
58	1:2:49	1:2:52	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
59	1:3:13	1:3:15	and then 
61	1:4:19	1:4:24	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
62	1:5:4	1:5:5	and then IY will come to a savannah 
63	1:8:9	1:8:16	for about two inch 
64	1:8:21	1:8:25	and IY be go up like 
65	1:14:25	1:14:28	and then IY you go up 
67	1:15:1	1:15:10	IY slope down again 
68	1:15:58	1:16:2	and 
69	1:17:29	1:17:33	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
70	1:19:8	1:19:12	have a s 
71	1:19:38	1:19:46	to the lake 
72	1:20:41	1:20:50	IY be kind of go 
73	1:21:35	1:21:43	ok plane crash be n there 
76	1:27:32	1:27:39	slight 
77	1:30:41	1:30:42	straight up 
78	1:31:3	1:31:6	uhm 
79	1:32:37	1:32:44	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
80	1:32:41	1:32:48	kind of across from stony desert 
81	1:34:6	1:34:7	and there  a plane crash 
82	1:38:36	1:38:38	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
83	1:48:11	1:48:18	after IY go straight again 
84	1:49:27	1:49:29	and then IY slope up 
85	1:49:59	1:49:59	IY be go like 
86	1:53:7	1:53:11	ok

105	2:20:22	2:20:31	IY be actually start like right 
106	2:20:42	2:20:49	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
107	2:20:47	2:20:53	ok 
108	2:21:15	2:21:19	right next to circle should be roman bath 
111	2:22:28	2:22:37	and then 
112	2:23:54	2:23:57	IY wanna kind of curve 
113	2:25:55	2:26:3	and then 
114	2:27:15	2:27:16	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle

116	2:29:4	2:29:11	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
117	2:29:19	2:29:24	the slate mountain be towards the right 
118	2:29:17	2:29:25	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
119	2:32:12	2:32:13	and  where the plane crash be 
120	2:33:55	2:34:2	uhm 
121	2:34:12	2:34:12	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
122	2:35:10	2:35:16	 little slope 
123	2:36:12	2:36:13	uhm 
124	2:36:13	2:36:14	IY be slope 
125	2:36:12	2:36:20	like four or five inch to the leave 
126	2:37:36	2:37:42	uhhh no 
127	2:38:53	2:38:57	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve

129	2:40:27	2:40:34	ok well 
130	2:40:45	2:40:47	on sheet anyway 
132	2:41:57	2:41:57	IY go straight down 
133	2:42:14	2:42:16	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
134	2:42:18	2:42:25	ok 
135	2:43:8	2:43:15	to the white mountain 
136	2:45:35	2:45:44	ok

150	2:58:24	2:58:29	then 
151	3:3:42	3:3:45	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
152	3:3:53	3:3:56	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
154	3:6:35	3:6:41	ok 
155	3:6:43	3:6:49	ok well

236	4:49:30	4:49:37	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
237	4:50:36	4:50:42	and then 
238	4:52:29	4:52:38	and then IY slope down to the leave

243	4:58:22	4:58:29	maybe like 
244	4:59:12	4:59:20	plane crash 
246	5:0:36	5:0:38	alright 
247	5:4:47	5:4:52	IY would say 
251	5:10:32	5:10:38	uhm

265	5:22:34	5:22:34	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
266	5:24:40	5:24:48	IY be at the plane crash 
268	5:24:52	5:25:0	like 
269	5:25:21	5:25:23	and then IY slope 
270	5:26:21	5:26:22	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there

275	5:31:35	5:31:41	no IY have 
276	5:33:1	5:33:8	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
278	5:34:49	5:34:56	the

308	6:5:41	6:5:45	IY get 
309	6:6:17	6:6:25	be the plane crash 
310	6:7:31	6:7:34	and then 
311	6:7:56	6:8:0	to the leave of little path where path should be
