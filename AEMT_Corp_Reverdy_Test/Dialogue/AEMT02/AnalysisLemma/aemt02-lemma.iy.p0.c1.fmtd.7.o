start
0:0:50	0:0:59	g	no 
0:1:23	0:1:32	g	not right at the stony desert 
0:1:59	0:2:4	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
0:3:6	0:3:10	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
0:3:43	0:3:47	f	around the top of the lake 
0:3:53	0:3:55	g	the 
0:4:59	0:5:2	f	ok 
0:5:20	0:5:20	g	uhm 
0:7:47	0:7:56	f	ok 
0:8:9	0:8:9	g	and there  a plane crash 
0:8:17	0:8:22	g	ok well 
0:8:24	0:8:32	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
0:9:47	0:9:48	g	uhm 
0:11:17	0:11:24	f	ok 
0:15:21	0:15:22	f	ok 
0:18:47	0:18:49	g	couple inch IY be slope down 
0:18:55	0:18:58	g	be IY anywhere near there 
0:21:52	0:22:1	g	like 
0:22:11	0:22:14	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
0:22:28	0:22:28	f	ok 
0:25:10	0:25:14	g	three inch 
0:25:57	0:25:57	g	and IY be slope to the leave 
0:28:7	0:28:7	f	ok 
0:28:18	0:28:27	g	IY be start at the stony desert 
0:28:57	0:28:58	g	ok 
0:30:2	0:30:2	g	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
0:32:42	0:32:44	f	ok 
0:32:53	0:33:2	g	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
0:33:26	0:33:34	f	yeah and IY go straight up 
0:34:26	0:34:31	f	and there  a collapse shelter 
0:35:53	0:35:53	f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
0:36:1	0:36:9	g	so IY be at the hot spring 
0:36:27	0:36:29	f	ok 
0:37:18	0:37:24	g	for like 
0:38:23	0:38:26	g	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
0:39:8	0:39:10	g	and IY be go up like 
0:39:9	0:39:12	g	uhm 
0:40:31	0:40:33	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
0:43:18	0:43:25	g	IY slope down again 
0:43:24	0:43:28	g	to the right 
0:44:27	0:44:35	f	elephant 
0:46:52	0:46:52	f	IY know IY have different thing so 
0:47:5	0:47:5	f	how many inch do IY think 
0:48:6	0:48:8	g	and then IY will come to a savannah 
0:48:51	0:48:58	g	uhm 
0:50:22	0:50:25	g	IY would say 
0:50:35	0:50:38	g	the slate mountain be towards the right 
0:51:33	0:51:33	g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
0:54:2	0:54:7	f	ok 
0:54:8	0:54:11	g	alright well IY will keep go and see 
0:54:52	0:54:52	g	and be to the leave 
0:55:40	0:55:41	g	 little slope 
0:55:53	0:56:1	g	alright 
0:56:31	0:56:38	f	IY have a plane crash though 
0:59:20	0:59:20	g	IY be go like 
1:1:13	1:1:13	f	mm hmm 
1:2:33	1:2:37	g	ok well 
1:4:29	1:4:35	g	do IY have roman bath 
1:8:32	1:8:39	g	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
1:9:10	1:9:18	f	and curve down to the leave 
1:9:16	1:9:25	f	ok 
1:9:33	1:9:41	f	so wait 
1:9:42	1:9:44	f	ok 
1:9:57	1:9:59	g	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
1:10:12	1:10:16	f	to the right 
1:10:55	1:11:2	f	ok 
1:11:1	1:11:6	g	ok 
1:12:57	1:12:58	g	and then 
1:13:43	1:13:52	f	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
1:14:7	1:14:11	g	a little 
1:15:10	1:15:15	g	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
1:15:21	1:15:25	g	no 
1:19:31	1:19:37	f	yeah 
1:19:34	1:19:43	g	ok 
1:20:11	1:20:20	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
1:21:14	1:21:14	g	and then 
1:24:36	1:24:38	g	maybe IY have different thing 
1:26:38	1:26:43	g	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
1:27:45	1:27:53	f	ok 
1:29:17	1:29:21	g	go up like three three and a half inch 
1:30:10	1:30:11	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
1:30:20	1:30:27	g	and then 
1:31:20	1:31:22	g	just do it like this ok 
1:33:43	1:33:43	g	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
1:36:2	1:36:11	g	well 
1:38:22	1:38:28	g	after IY slope down IY will say 
1:40:16	1:40:25	f	ok 
1:41:33	1:41:35	g	ok 
1:41:56	1:42:2	g	be the plane crash 
1:42:38	1:42:43	f	around the lake to the top 
1:46:18	1:46:23	g	and then IY go 
1:46:44	1:46:44	g	and then IY you go up 
1:47:20	1:47:27	g	ok 
1:47:53	1:47:57	g	ok 
1:50:13	1:50:16	f	yeah 
1:50:38	1:50:41	g	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
1:53:14	1:53:20	g	couple mile or something 
1:53:36	1:53:41	f	ok 
1:54:29	1:54:31	f	to the leave 
1:54:49	1:54:50	g	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
1:54:52	1:54:53	g	IY be go about 
1:54:52	1:54:57	f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
1:55:48	1:55:53	g	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
1:55:56	1:56:0	g	like IY be slope 
1:59:11	1:59:14	g	uhm 
2:0:19	2:0:19	g	IY be kind of go 
2:2:19	2:2:20	g	uhm 
2:2:34	2:2:39	g	to right 
2:3:48	2:3:48	g	and then 
2:5:58	2:6:2	g	maybe four inch on the paper 
2:6:40	2:6:48	g	and 
2:7:3	2:7:3	g	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
2:8:13	2:8:20	g	maybe 
2:10:48	2:10:49	f	ok 
2:11:9	2:11:13	g	IY make 
2:12:2	2:12:11	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
2:12:31	2:12:34	f	and then what 
2:12:48	2:12:55	g	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
2:13:6	2:13:8	g	probably the same thing 
2:13:5	2:13:12	g	then 
2:14:43	2:14:49	g	ok 
2:15:8	2:15:10	f	yeah 
2:15:39	2:15:42	g	maybe like 
2:18:49	2:18:55	g	but 
2:19:17	2:19:23	g	IY be actually start like right 
2:19:18	2:19:27	g	IY have a waterhole on map 
2:20:6	2:20:13	g	to the leave 
2:21:31	2:21:35	g	what 
2:21:50	2:21:55	f	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
2:22:35	2:22:42	g	slight 
2:22:37	2:22:46	g	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
2:25:28	2:25:36	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
2:25:49	2:25:50	g	IY be at the plane crash 
2:26:50	2:26:50	g	yes 
2:27:21	2:27:25	g	for like 
2:28:2	2:28:10	g	and then 
2:28:18	2:28:22	g	ok 
2:28:35	2:28:39	g	uhm 
2:28:38	2:28:41	g	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
2:31:53	2:32:1	g	and then IY slope down to the leave 
2:34:46	2:34:52	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
2:35:35	2:35:43	g	ok 
2:35:46	2:35:50	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
2:38:1	2:38:1	g	uhm 
2:40:30	2:40:38	f	uh IY do n know know what to say 
2:40:36	2:40:42	f	do IY go around it 
2:41:53	2:41:55	g	uhm 
2:42:2	2:42:8	g	 about five or six inch 
2:42:9	2:42:9	g	so anyway 
2:43:59	2:44:2	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
2:44:35	2:44:39	g	have a s 
2:50:0	2:50:0	g	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
2:50:40	2:50:46	g	IY be start 
2:53:9	2:53:17	f	IY go to a lake 
2:53:53	2:54:2	g	after IY go straight again 
2:53:57	2:54:5	f	IY be start yeah the stony desert 
2:56:2	2:56:6	g	be IY in like 
2:57:15	2:57:23	g	three inch straight across 
2:58:52	2:58:53	g	uhm 
2:58:52	2:58:59	g	like four or five inch to the leave 
2:58:56	2:59:3	g	no IY have 
2:59:1	2:59:8	f	ok 
3:0:30	3:0:36	g	and then 
3:3:36	3:3:36	g	so IY go three inch straight 
3:3:58	3:3:59	f	and to the right 
3:6:27	3:6:34	g	there  a there  
3:7:3	3:7:10	g	ok IY be at the savannah 
3:8:1	3:8:2	g	and  where the plane crash be 
3:8:49	3:8:51	g	no there  no elephant 
3:10:4	3:10:7	g	three inch 
3:10:7	3:10:16	g	from 
3:10:59	3:11:5	g	maybe like 
3:12:26	3:12:27	g	five 
3:12:31	3:12:34	g	ok

3:16:55	3:16:56	g	ok 
3:21:4	3:21:8	f	no IY will go with hot spring IY have 
3:21:10	3:21:15	f	IY hit some round rock 
3:22:27	3:22:35	g	no IY do n have a waterhole 
3:23:21	3:23:21	f	uhm 
3:23:30	3:23:37	f	mm mm 
3:24:19	3:24:19	g	around the bottom of it 
3:24:37	3:24:41	f	ok 
3:26:40	3:26:47	g	ok 
3:27:25	3:27:34	g	and then IY be 
3:27:31	3:27:40	g	like 
3:28:12	3:28:15	f	plane crash IY do n think be yeah 
3:28:45	3:28:47	g	ok 
3:30:3	3:30:6	g	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
3:30:9	3:30:11	f	yeah 
3:30:25	3:30:28	f	ok 
3:31:17	3:31:20	g	IY be slope 
3:31:41	3:31:44	g	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
3:34:9	3:34:12	g	on sheet anyway 
3:34:45	3:34:53	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
3:35:54	3:35:57	g	and then IY go straight 
3:39:35	3:39:42	g	uhm IY straighten out slope 
3:41:7	3:41:9	f	yep 
3:41:5	3:41:12	g	straight up 
3:42:28	3:42:37	g	and 
3:44:6	3:44:8	f	up tp the right 
3:45:5	3:45:13	g	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
3:45:11	3:45:15	g	yes IY be go towards the lake 
3:45:33	3:45:38	f	ok 
3:46:42	3:46:47	f	ok 
3:46:49	3:46:52	g	it  right next to it 
3:48:7	3:48:7	g	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
3:48:54	3:48:58	g	ok and then IY be go 
3:48:51	3:49:0	f	IY have to back up a little bit 
3:49:7	3:49:10	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
3:51:53	3:51:55	g	ok 
3:52:4	3:52:6	g	be IY 
3:52:41	3:52:45	g	ok 
3:53:8	3:53:10	g	like an inch 
3:53:27	3:53:35	g	four or five inch to the leave 
3:54:59	3:55:7	f	mm hmm 
3:56:56	3:57:0	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
3:57:22	3:57:24	g	to the leave 
3:58:54	3:58:54	g	so  about IY would say 
4:1:1	4:1:4	f	IY have plane crash IY be talk about earlier  up there 
4:1:29	4:1:29	g	ok 
4:2:56	4:3:2	g	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
4:5:44	4:5:52	g	ok plane crash be n there 
4:6:5	4:6:12	g	they be there 
4:8:27	4:8:33	f	mm hmm 
4:9:11	4:9:17	f	so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
4:9:33	4:9:33	g	IY do n know 
4:9:38	4:9:38	f	IY hit some rock though 
4:9:39	4:9:42	g	and then IY slope up 
4:10:44	4:10:44	f	nope 
4:11:38	4:11:45	g	alright alright well just 
4:12:28	4:12:32	g	just a slight slope 
4:12:37	4:12:46	g	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
4:13:45	4:13:51	g	to the white mountain 
4:16:23	4:16:26	g	and then IY slope 
4:16:43	4:16:50	g	plane crash 
4:17:19	4:17:28	g	uhm 
4:18:5	4:18:7	g	and slope be about an inch long 
4:18:20	4:18:22	g	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
4:18:26	4:18:32	g	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
4:19:31	4:19:36	f	yeah 
4:20:1	4:20:7	g	ok 
4:21:58	4:22:6	g	IY just kind of slope down 
4:22:9	4:22:10	g	ok 
4:22:57	4:23:1	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
4:24:16	4:24:23	f	oh 
4:24:33	4:24:42	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
4:24:38	4:24:45	f	mm hmm 
4:26:21	4:26:27	g	kind of across from stony desert 
4:33:20	4:33:22	g	hmm 
4:35:50	4:35:52	g	ok 
4:36:48	4:36:54	g	so IY make circle 
4:37:10	4:37:13	g	away about like four inch four or five inch 
4:37:13	4:37:15	g	what 
4:39:11	4:39:16	f	ok wait hold on 
4:41:9	4:41:13	g	for about two inch

4:42:28	4:42:33	g	IY 
4:43:31	4:43:38	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
4:45:18	4:45:24	f	and 
4:45:51	4:45:58	g	and then 
4:46:30	4:46:33	f	but  like five six inch from where IY be now 
4:47:39	4:47:44	g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
4:48:24	4:48:27	g	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
4:50:59	4:51:6	g	uhm and there be a stony desert 
4:52:55	4:52:58	f	ok 
4:54:35	4:54:44	g	alright 
4:55:46	4:55:46	g	and then

5:2:35	5:2:36	g	ok 
5:2:51	5:2:54	g	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
5:3:7	5:3:16	f	ok 
5:5:33	5:5:33	f	IY be at the savannah 
5:6:7	5:6:16	f	mm hmm

5:10:1	5:10:7	g	a quarter of an inch 
5:10:9	5:10:10	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
5:11:19	5:11:23	g	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
5:11:33	5:11:39	f	ok 
5:16:0	5:16:2	g	and IY be go straight up 
5:16:16	5:16:25	g	like maybe an inch 
5:18:55	5:18:59	g	well just 
5:19:28	5:19:35	g	like 
5:20:0	5:20:1	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
5:20:42	5:20:42	g	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
5:20:50	5:20:59	f	it  not like in the same place IY be describe 
5:23:48	5:23:48	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
5:23:46	5:23:55	g	an inch maybe a little bit less 
5:23:53	5:23:57	g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
5:27:15	5:27:17	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
5:33:32	5:33:34	f	yeah IY see 
5:33:40	5:33:49	g	and IY just go straight up 
5:36:16	5:36:25	g	to the lake 
5:38:10	5:38:13	g	no IY do n have any rock 
5:41:20	5:41:28	g	IY move to the leave 
5:42:45	5:42:46	f	to 
5:45:52	5:45:58	g	and IY be go
