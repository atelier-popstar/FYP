21	0:26:9	0:26:16	to the lake 
22	0:28:29	0:28:29	like 
23	0:29:47	0:29:56	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
24	0:30:50	0:30:57	then 
27	0:31:41	0:31:45	 little slope 
29	0:32:54	0:33:3	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
30	0:33:14	0:33:19	ok 
31	0:33:28	0:33:31	uhm IY straighten out slope 
32	0:33:34	0:33:41	an inch maybe a little bit less 
34	0:39:36	0:39:45	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
35	0:39:55	0:39:55	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
36	0:41:21	0:41:26	be IY anywhere near there 
38	0:44:36	0:44:38	ok 
39	0:44:37	0:44:38	and then

44	0:48:46	0:48:52	yes IY be go towards the lake 
46	0:52:9	0:52:10	right next to circle should be roman bath 
47	0:52:19	0:52:20	and it slope a little bit to the right 
48	0:54:18	0:54:21	couple inch IY be slope down 
49	0:54:17	0:54:24	uhm 
50	0:54:31	0:54:36	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
52	0:56:0	0:56:5	to the leave of little path where path should be 
53	0:57:17	0:57:21	well alright 
54	0:57:20	0:57:29	IY be at the plane crash 
55	0:57:21	0:57:30	IY be just go down 
56	0:57:31	0:57:35	IY be start 
57	0:58:45	0:58:52	and then 
58	1:2:23	1:2:27	a little bit too 
60	1:4:16	1:4:22	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
61	1:6:46	1:6:48	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
62	1:6:44	1:6:50	and then IY slope 
65	1:11:1	1:11:9	and be to the leave 
66	1:11:39	1:11:45	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
68	1:14:1	1:14:4	there  a there  
69	1:15:36	1:15:45	no 
70	1:18:34	1:18:38	maybe IY have different thing

77	1:27:6	1:27:11	ok 
78	1:27:50	1:27:55	and then IY slope down to the leave 
80	1:30:1	1:30:6	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
82	1:33:31	1:33:34	ok 
83	1:34:59	1:35:3	for about two inch 
84	1:35:34	1:35:43	the 
85	1:35:45	1:35:47	uhm 
86	1:35:43	1:35:48	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
87	1:36:11	1:36:14	what 
88	1:37:48	1:37:57	after IY go straight again 
89	1:39:51	1:39:56	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
90	1:40:12	1:40:20	it  right next to it 
91	1:40:51	1:40:55	ok well 
92	1:45:51	1:45:55	maybe like

96	1:50:29	1:50:29	straight up 
97	1:50:32	1:50:36	plane crash 
98	1:51:35	1:51:36	like four or five inch to the leave 
100	1:53:29	1:53:37	and there  a plane crash 
102	1:58:48	1:58:52	be the plane crash 
103	2:0:13	2:0:22	well 
105	2:1:42	2:1:44	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
106	2:1:45	2:1:48	but 
107	2:4:53	2:4:53	so IY go three inch straight 
109	2:7:18	2:7:21	yes 
110	2:8:6	2:8:6	IY make 
113	2:11:25	2:11:29	ok IY be at the savannah

116	2:16:53	2:17:2	ok 
117	2:18:34	2:18:36	after IY slope down IY will say 
118	2:20:2	2:20:6	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
119	2:20:56	2:21:5	alright 
120	2:21:10	2:21:11	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
121	2:21:39	2:21:43	and then IY you go up 
123	2:22:59	2:23:3	IY would say 
128	2:29:25	2:29:32	to the leave

131	2:33:43	2:33:51	ok 
132	2:34:41	2:34:42	uhm 
134	2:37:27	2:37:34	like 
135	2:37:50	2:37:56	IY have a waterhole on map 
136	2:38:1	2:38:10	and  where the plane crash be 
137	2:38:5	2:38:12	it  not a big curve 
138	2:38:52	2:38:56	ok 
139	2:40:6	2:40:13	so  about IY would say 
140	2:40:8	2:40:15	IY go straight down 
142	2:43:17	2:43:24	and then IY slope up 
143	2:44:43	2:44:47	the slate mountain be towards the right 
144	2:44:49	2:44:54	uhm 
145	2:47:23	2:47:23	maybe like 
146	2:48:28	2:48:35	do IY have roman bath 
147	2:49:18	2:49:21	ok well 
148	2:50:25	2:50:33	ok and then IY be go 
149	2:50:50	2:50:50	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
150	2:51:3	2:51:3	so anyway 
153	2:55:26	2:55:27	to the white mountain 
154	2:58:21	2:58:28	kind of across from stony desert 
156	3:0:43	3:0:49	ok 
158	3:4:56	3:4:58	they be there 
161	3:10:54	3:10:54	IY be kind of go 
162	3:10:59	3:10:59	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
163	3:13:44	3:13:49	be IY in like almost the top of the 
164	3:15:28	3:15:37	to right 
165	3:17:35	3:17:37	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
166	3:17:54	3:18:3	uhm 
168	3:19:30	3:19:35	ok 
169	3:21:33	3:21:42	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
171	3:27:23	3:27:30	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
172	3:28:26	3:28:26	IY be actually start like right 
174	3:29:0	3:29:7	and then IY be go down 
175	3:30:2	3:30:4	uhm

183	3:43:29	3:43:32	and IY just go straight up 
184	3:44:48	3:44:54	no IY do n have a waterhole 
185	3:45:45	3:45:50	away about like four inch four or five inch 
187	3:46:7	3:46:13	for like 
188	3:48:26	3:48:32	and then 
190	3:50:46	3:50:52	well 
191	3:52:40	3:52:49	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
193	3:55:45	3:55:53	IY be start at the stony desert 
195	3:57:23	3:57:32	for like 
196	3:57:33	3:57:39	hmm 
198	4:1:15	4:1:22	alright alright well just

202	4:9:58	4:10:7	uhm 
203	4:12:10	4:12:10	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
204	4:14:21	4:14:30	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
205	4:14:46	4:14:46	ok 
207	4:14:50	4:14:54	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
208	4:18:28	4:18:34	ok 
209	4:19:24	4:19:26	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there

212	4:21:10	4:21:16	five 
213	4:21:29	4:21:36	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
214	4:24:58	4:25:1	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
215	4:25:2	4:25:5	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
216	4:29:0	4:29:1	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
218	4:29:45	4:29:52	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
219	4:31:3	4:31:12	IY do n know 
221	4:31:56	4:31:56	and IY be go up like 
222	4:32:14	4:32:21	probably the same thing

226	4:39:42	4:39:42	no IY have 
228	4:40:45	4:40:53	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
232	4:45:12	4:45:12	IY 
233	4:46:8	4:46:14	alright well IY will keep go and see 
235	4:47:11	4:47:15	uhm

244	4:59:18	4:59:20	and slope be about an inch long 
245	4:59:30	4:59:36	like IY be slope 
246	5:0:23	5:0:23	not right at the stony desert 
247	5:1:47	5:1:49	ok 
248	5:1:51	5:1:52	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
249	5:2:32	5:2:33	from 
250	5:4:1	5:4:7	like 
251	5:4:33	5:4:34	three inch straight across 
252	5:6:42	5:6:47	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
253	5:7:13	5:7:13	maybe four inch on the paper 
255	5:7:54	5:7:57	just do it like this ok 
256	5:8:38	5:8:40	four or five inch to the leave 
259	5:10:47	5:10:50	and then 
261	5:17:11	5:17:15	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
262	5:17:14	5:17:19	just a slight slope 
264	5:17:48	5:17:49	and 
266	5:19:12	5:19:15	IY just kind of slope down 
268	5:19:49	5:19:56	like three inch 
269	5:22:5	5:22:9	a little 
270	5:24:43	5:24:50	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
271	5:25:47	5:25:53	after plane crash 
274	5:30:53	5:30:54	ok 
275	5:30:52	5:30:58	ok plane crash be n there 
276	5:32:4	5:32:6	and IY be go straight up 
277	5:32:8	5:32:17	maybe 
278	5:32:21	5:32:27	uhm

282	5:33:36	5:33:37	no 
283	5:33:35	5:33:40	after the circle

307	5:57:27	5:57:30	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
308	5:57:41	5:57:48	and IY be slope to the leave 
309	6:0:8	6:0:16	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
310	6:0:16	6:0:19	and then 
311	6:0:17	6:0:20	slight 
312	6:0:57	6:0:58	IY slope down again 
313	6:1:54	6:1:59	uh like 
315	6:3:34	6:3:34	IY wanna kind of curve

322	6:10:33	6:10:35	uhm 
323	6:10:52	6:10:53	so IY make circle 
324	6:12:51	6:12:54	and then IY will come to a savannah 
327	6:14:42	6:14:46	go up like three three and a half inch 
329	6:14:40	6:14:49	to the right 
330	6:15:54	6:16:0	IY be go about 
331	6:16:7	6:16:11	ok 
333	6:18:6	6:18:9	uhm and there be a stony desert 
334	6:19:53	6:20:2	alright be IY start near the 
338	6:25:17	6:25:17	well just 
339	6:27:26	6:27:32	and then

341	6:30:29	6:30:30	so 
342	6:34:3	6:34:10	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
start f
0	0:1:27	0:1:29	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
8	0:9:46	0:9:52	ok 
11	0:12:47	0:12:53	and curve down to the leave

129	2:29:32	2:29:37	but  like five six inch from where IY be now 
133	2:36:13	2:36:21	up tp the right 
141	2:41:21	2:41:26	ok 
151	2:51:13	2:51:21	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
152	2:52:46	2:52:53	mm mm 
155	3:0:41	3:0:44	and 
157	3:2:1	3:2:7	so IY go to the leave of the antelope

220	4:31:11	4:31:18	ok 
223	4:32:39	4:32:40	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
227	4:39:56	4:40:5	plane crash IY do n think be yeah 
229	4:42:2	4:42:7	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
230	4:42:47	4:42:56	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
231	4:43:37	4:43:45	uh IY do n know know what to say

291	5:40:45	5:40:49	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
293	5:41:19	5:41:26	IY have a plane crash though 
297	5:46:56	5:46:58	yep 
298	5:47:11	5:47:18	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right

326	6:14:36	6:14:42	ok 
328	6:14:45	6:14:49	and there  a collapse shelter 
332	6:17:43	6:17:43	do IY go by the plane crash 
335	6:20:21	6:20:23	it  not like in the same place IY be describe 
336	6:20:56	6:21:4	yeah 
337	6:22:32	6:22:35	yeah IY see

3	0:4:3	0:4:7	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
4	0:4:34	0:4:39	so IY be at the hot spring 
5	0:6:14	0:6:20	IY be go like 
6	0:7:23	0:7:26	and then IY be 
7	0:8:17	0:8:21	ok

22	0:28:29	0:28:29	like 
23	0:29:47	0:29:56	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
24	0:30:50	0:30:57	then 
27	0:31:41	0:31:45	 little slope 
29	0:32:54	0:33:3	and IY go down IY slope to the right

31	0:33:28	0:33:31	uhm IY straighten out slope 
32	0:33:34	0:33:41	an inch maybe a little bit less 
34	0:39:36	0:39:45	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
35	0:39:55	0:39:55	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
36	0:41:21	0:41:26	be IY anywhere near there

50	0:54:31	0:54:36	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
52	0:56:0	0:56:5	to the leave of little path where path should be 
53	0:57:17	0:57:21	well alright 
54	0:57:20	0:57:29	IY be at the plane crash 
55	0:57:21	0:57:30	IY be just go down 
56	0:57:31	0:57:35	IY be start 
57	0:58:45	0:58:52	and then 
58	1:2:23	1:2:27	a little bit too 
60	1:4:16	1:4:22	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
61	1:6:46	1:6:48	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
62	1:6:44	1:6:50	and then IY slope 
65	1:11:1	1:11:9	and be to the leave 
66	1:11:39	1:11:45	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
68	1:14:1	1:14:4	there  a there  
69	1:15:36	1:15:45	no 
70	1:18:34	1:18:38	maybe IY have different thing

85	1:35:45	1:35:47	uhm 
86	1:35:43	1:35:48	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
87	1:36:11	1:36:14	what 
88	1:37:48	1:37:57	after IY go straight again 
89	1:39:51	1:39:56	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well

98	1:51:35	1:51:36	like four or five inch to the leave 
100	1:53:29	1:53:37	and there  a plane crash 
102	1:58:48	1:58:52	be the plane crash 
103	2:0:13	2:0:22	well 
105	2:1:42	2:1:44	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down

116	2:16:53	2:17:2	ok 
117	2:18:34	2:18:36	after IY slope down IY will say 
118	2:20:2	2:20:6	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
119	2:20:56	2:21:5	alright 
120	2:21:10	2:21:11	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
121	2:21:39	2:21:43	and then IY you go up 
123	2:22:59	2:23:3	IY would say

134	2:37:27	2:37:34	like 
135	2:37:50	2:37:56	IY have a waterhole on map 
136	2:38:1	2:38:10	and  where the plane crash be 
137	2:38:5	2:38:12	it  not a big curve 
138	2:38:52	2:38:56	ok 
139	2:40:6	2:40:13	so  about IY would say 
140	2:40:8	2:40:15	IY go straight down 
142	2:43:17	2:43:24	and then IY slope up 
143	2:44:43	2:44:47	the slate mountain be towards the right 
144	2:44:49	2:44:54	uhm 
145	2:47:23	2:47:23	maybe like 
146	2:48:28	2:48:35	do IY have roman bath 
147	2:49:18	2:49:21	ok well 
148	2:50:25	2:50:33	ok and then IY be go 
149	2:50:50	2:50:50	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start

164	3:15:28	3:15:37	to right 
165	3:17:35	3:17:37	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight

168	3:19:30	3:19:35	ok 
169	3:21:33	3:21:42	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
171	3:27:23	3:27:30	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
172	3:28:26	3:28:26	IY be actually start like right 
174	3:29:0	3:29:7	and then IY be go down

188	3:48:26	3:48:32	and then 
190	3:50:46	3:50:52	well 
191	3:52:40	3:52:49	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
193	3:55:45	3:55:53	IY be start at the stony desert 
195	3:57:23	3:57:32	for like 
196	3:57:33	3:57:39	hmm 
198	4:1:15	4:1:22	alright alright well just

214	4:24:58	4:25:1	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
215	4:25:2	4:25:5	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
216	4:29:0	4:29:1	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
218	4:29:45	4:29:52	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
219	4:31:3	4:31:12	IY do n know 
221	4:31:56	4:31:56	and IY be go up like

226	4:39:42	4:39:42	no IY have 
228	4:40:45	4:40:53	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
232	4:45:12	4:45:12	IY 
233	4:46:8	4:46:14	alright well IY will keep go and see 
235	4:47:11	4:47:15	uhm

241	4:56:34	4:56:37	a quarter of an inch 
244	4:59:18	4:59:20	and slope be about an inch long 
245	4:59:30	4:59:36	like IY be slope 
246	5:0:23	5:0:23	not right at the stony desert 
247	5:1:47	5:1:49	ok 
248	5:1:51	5:1:52	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
249	5:2:32	5:2:33	from 
250	5:4:1	5:4:7	like 
251	5:4:33	5:4:34	three inch straight across 
252	5:6:42	5:6:47	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
253	5:7:13	5:7:13	maybe four inch on the paper 
255	5:7:54	5:7:57	just do it like this ok 
256	5:8:38	5:8:40	four or five inch to the leave 
259	5:10:47	5:10:50	and then 
261	5:17:11	5:17:15	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up

266	5:19:12	5:19:15	IY just kind of slope down 
268	5:19:49	5:19:56	like three inch 
269	5:22:5	5:22:9	a little 
270	5:24:43	5:24:50	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
271	5:25:47	5:25:53	after plane crash 
274	5:30:53	5:30:54	ok 
275	5:30:52	5:30:58	ok plane crash be n there 
276	5:32:4	5:32:6	and IY be go straight up 
277	5:32:8	5:32:17	maybe 
278	5:32:21	5:32:27	uhm

285	5:34:37	5:34:46	uhm 
286	5:36:46	5:36:55	on sheet anyway 
287	5:38:39	5:38:39	and then IY go straight 
288	5:39:22	5:39:30	to the leave 
290	5:40:5	5:40:11	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
292	5:41:17	5:41:24	have a s 
294	5:42:20	5:42:20	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
295	5:43:38	5:43:42	ok 
296	5:44:19	5:44:19	IY get 
299	5:49:8	5:49:8	be IY 
300	5:49:46	5:49:47	ok 
301	5:49:51	5:49:52	IY be slope 
302	5:50:11	5:50:19	and then IY go 
303	5:51:24	5:51:29	ok 
304	5:51:37	5:51:42	like an inch 
305	5:51:49	5:51:53	and 
306	5:55:50	5:55:50	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
307	5:57:27	5:57:30	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
308	5:57:41	5:57:48	and IY be slope to the leave 
309	6:0:8	6:0:16	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
