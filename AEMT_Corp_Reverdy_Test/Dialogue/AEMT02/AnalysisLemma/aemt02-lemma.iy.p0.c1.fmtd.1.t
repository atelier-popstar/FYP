2	1:1:14	1:2:38	IY be start 
3	1:2:38	1:4:3	uhm and there be a stony desert 
4	1:4:3	1:5:30	IY be actually start like right 
5	1:5:30	1:6:36	uhm 
6	1:6:36	1:7:12	kind of across from stony desert 
7	1:7:12	1:7:49	and 
8	1:7:49	1:9:16	IY be kind of go 
9	1:9:16	1:10:21	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
10	1:10:21	1:11:58	and IY be go 
11	1:11:58	1:11:58	IY would say 
12	1:11:58	1:13:13	maybe 
13	1:13:13	1:14:48	couple mile or something 
14	1:14:48	1:16:24	from 
15	1:16:24	1:18:18	uhm 
16	1:18:18	1:19:54	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
17	1:19:54	1:20:28	uhm 
18	1:20:28	1:20:47	there  a there  
20	1:21:7	1:21:27	ok 
22	1:23:13	1:24:43	ok 
23	1:24:43	1:26:21	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
25	1:26:32	1:27:30	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
26	1:27:30	1:29:27	and then 
27	1:29:27	1:31:2	uhm 
28	1:31:2	1:31:57	IY just kind of slope down 
29	1:31:57	1:33:3	a little bit too 
30	1:33:3	1:35:1	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
31	1:35:1	1:36:42	after IY slope down IY will say 
32	1:36:42	1:37:23	like 
33	1:37:23	1:38:36	maybe like 
34	1:38:36	1:39:45	couple inch IY be slope down 
35	1:39:45	1:40:4	and then IY go straight 
36	1:40:4	1:41:12	for like 
37	1:41:12	1:42:38	like 
38	1:42:38	1:43:7	five 
39	1:43:7	1:44:52	maybe four inch on the paper 
40	1:44:52	1:46:41	and there  a plane crash 
45	1:51:1	1:51:8	plane crash 
47	1:52:54	1:54:39	uhm 
48	1:54:39	1:56:10	alright be IY start near the 
50	1:57:50	1:58:49	be IY 
51	1:58:49	2:0:15	IY be start at the stony desert 
53	2:1:27	2:2:43	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
55	2:2:45	2:3:0	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
56	2:3:0	2:4:49	not right at the stony desert 
58	2:6:20	2:7:7	ok and then IY be go 
60	2:8:6	2:8:22	to the leave 
61	2:8:22	2:8:52	like an inch 
62	2:8:52	2:9:33	and then IY be go down 
63	2:9:33	2:10:23	like maybe an inch 
64	2:10:23	2:11:16	 little slope 
66	2:11:26	2:12:7	and then IY go 
67	2:12:7	2:14:6	like four or five inch to the leave 
68	2:14:6	2:15:36	and  where the plane crash be 
69	2:15:36	2:16:54	be IY anywhere near there 
72	2:17:55	2:19:7	four or five inch to the leave 
74	2:19:19	2:19:26	and then 
75	2:19:26	2:20:37	after plane crash 
78	2:23:6	2:24:3	ok plane crash be n there 
79	2:24:3	2:25:11	uhm 
80	2:25:11	2:25:42	alright well IY will keep go and see 
81	2:25:42	2:26:2	alright 
82	2:26:2	2:27:21	so 
83	2:27:21	2:27:33	uhm 
84	2:27:33	2:28:23	IY be at the plane crash 
85	2:28:23	2:29:22	and 
86	2:29:22	2:29:56	IY wanna kind of curve 
87	2:29:56	2:30:21	a little 
88	2:30:21	2:31:28	to the leave 
89	2:31:28	2:31:28	and then IY you go up 
90	2:31:28	2:32:58	and IY be go up like 
91	2:32:58	2:33:33	three inch 
93	2:33:53	2:35:37	and 
94	2:35:37	2:35:51	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
95	2:35:51	2:36:0	it  not a big curve 
97	2:37:25	2:39:2	ok 
98	2:39:2	2:39:23	and then 
99	2:39:23	2:40:59	uhm 
100	2:40:59	2:42:34	after IY go straight again 
101	2:42:34	2:44:28	away about like four inch four or five inch 
102	2:44:28	2:46:4	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
103	2:46:4	2:46:22	be IY anywere near there 
105	2:47:25	2:48:55	ok 
107	2:50:25	2:51:31	yes 
109	2:52:13	2:53:51	yes 
111	2:54:3	2:55:40	ok 
112	2:55:40	2:56:6	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
113	2:56:6	2:57:58	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
114	2:57:58	2:58:33	just a slight slope 
115	2:58:33	3:0:21	about like 
116	3:0:21	3:0:48	an inch maybe a little bit less 
118	3:1:13	3:2:59	to the right 
119	3:2:59	3:3:12	IY be slope 
122	3:4:36	3:5:15	ok 
123	3:5:15	3:7:9	and then 
124	3:7:9	3:7:56	IY 
125	3:7:56	3:9:32	have a s 
126	3:9:32	3:11:23	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
127	3:11:23	3:12:51	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
129	3:14:47	3:15:39	slight 
130	3:15:39	3:16:45	uhm 
131	3:16:45	3:17:37	and then IY will come to a savannah 
133	3:18:42	3:20:37	ok 
135	3:22:16	3:23:20	uhhh no 
136	3:23:20	3:25:10	no IY do n have a waterhole 
137	3:25:10	3:26:33	IY have a waterhole on map 
139	3:26:58	3:27:34	well 
140	3:27:34	3:27:52	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
142	3:28:27	3:29:12	ok 
144	3:30:32	3:32:30	ok IY be at the savannah 
145	3:32:30	3:32:33	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
146	3:32:33	3:32:52	like 
147	3:32:52	3:34:36	three inch 
149	3:35:55	3:37:9	and IY be go straight up 
150	3:37:9	3:38:26	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
152	3:39:1	3:40:56	ok well 
153	3:40:56	3:41:0	probably the same thing 
156	3:42:47	3:44:39	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
158	3:45:32	3:47:29	straight up 
160	3:48:18	3:49:4	hmm 
161	3:49:4	3:49:23	well 
162	3:49:23	3:50:53	IY do n know 
163	3:50:53	3:50:57	alright 
164	3:50:57	3:51:32	well just 
166	3:51:44	3:52:54	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
167	3:52:54	3:53:18	the slate mountain be towards the right 
168	3:53:18	3:53:18	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
169	3:53:18	3:54:59	be IY in like 
170	3:54:59	3:55:57	be IY in like almost the top of the 
172	3:56:35	3:56:43	no IY have 
173	3:56:43	3:58:15	maybe IY have different thing 
174	3:58:15	3:59:13	well alright 
176	4:0:54	4:2:42	alright alright well just 
177	4:2:42	4:2:55	just do it like this ok 
178	4:2:55	4:4:29	go up like three three and a half inch 
180	4:5:26	4:6:53	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
182	4:8:37	4:9:28	it  right next to it 
183	4:9:28	4:11:4	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
185	4:12:8	4:12:49	maybe like 
186	4:12:49	4:14:10	a quarter of an inch 
187	4:14:10	4:15:44	to the leave of little path where path should be 
190	4:18:41	4:20:15	ok 
191	4:20:15	4:20:30	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
192	4:20:30	4:20:58	for like 
193	4:20:58	4:22:22	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
195	4:23:0	4:23:39	and then IY slope down to the leave 
196	4:23:39	4:25:31	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
198	4:25:52	4:27:8	ok 
199	4:27:8	4:28:7	and then 
200	4:28:7	4:29:56	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
202	4:31:9	4:31:54	ok 
203	4:31:54	4:33:41	so IY be at the hot spring 
204	4:33:41	4:34:47	and IY be slope to the leave 
205	4:34:47	4:34:50	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
207	4:36:29	4:36:50	ok 
208	4:36:50	4:38:25	and then 
209	4:38:25	4:38:56	uhm 
210	4:38:56	4:39:19	IY slope down again 
212	4:39:27	4:40:20	uhm 
213	4:40:20	4:42:2	no there  no elephant 
214	4:42:2	4:43:6	on sheet anyway 
217	4:44:11	4:44:38	no 
218	4:44:38	4:45:16	IY be just go down 
219	4:45:16	4:46:31	like IY be slope 
220	4:46:31	4:47:20	and slope be about an inch long 
221	4:47:20	4:49:4	and be to the leave 
223	4:50:2	4:51:58	ok 
224	4:51:58	4:53:35	and then 
225	4:53:35	4:55:5	uhm 
226	4:55:5	4:56:26	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
227	4:56:26	4:57:48	to the leave 
229	4:59:22	4:59:22	ok 
230	4:59:22	4:59:43	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
232	5:0:13	5:1:9	to the white mountain 
234	5:2:31	5:2:43	ok 
235	5:2:43	5:2:43	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
236	5:2:43	5:3:37	and it slope a little bit to the right 
237	5:3:37	5:4:8	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
239	5:5:9	5:6:3	ok 
240	5:6:3	5:6:3	so  about IY would say 
241	5:6:3	5:6:34	 about five or six inch 
243	5:6:55	5:6:59	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
245	5:7:47	5:8:25	uhm IY straighten out slope 
246	5:8:25	5:9:22	and IY just go straight up 
247	5:9:22	5:11:13	for about two inch 
248	5:11:13	5:12:14	ok 
250	5:13:49	5:15:25	then 
252	5:16:25	5:17:11	no IY do n have any rock 
254	5:18:38	5:18:40	ok 
256	5:20:29	5:20:51	ok 
257	5:20:51	5:21:16	uhm 
258	5:21:16	5:22:33	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
259	5:22:33	5:23:38	and then IY slope 
260	5:23:38	5:24:27	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
262	5:24:41	5:26:27	yes IY be go towards the lake 
264	5:27:42	5:28:36	but 
265	5:28:36	5:29:54	IY be go about 
266	5:29:54	5:30:40	three inch straight across 
267	5:30:40	5:31:50	to the lake 
268	5:31:50	5:32:32	and then IY be 
269	5:32:32	5:33:47	IY get 
271	5:35:46	5:36:23	uhm 
272	5:36:23	5:37:22	no 
273	5:37:22	5:39:21	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
274	5:39:21	5:40:36	so IY go three inch straight 
275	5:40:36	5:41:36	and then IY slope up 
276	5:41:36	5:42:40	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
278	5:43:0	5:44:10	the 
279	5:44:10	5:44:27	what 
281	5:45:7	5:46:52	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
283	5:47:51	5:49:37	ok 
284	5:49:37	5:49:53	and then 
285	5:49:53	5:51:21	uhm 
286	5:51:21	5:53:11	right next to circle should be roman bath 
287	5:53:11	5:54:50	do IY have roman bath 
289	5:55:17	5:57:5	ok well 
290	5:57:5	5:57:30	they be there 
291	5:57:30	5:58:34	so anyway 
292	5:58:34	5:58:43	IY make 
294	6:0:27	6:2:23	what 
296	6:2:55	6:4:8	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
297	6:4:8	6:4:42	so IY make circle 
300	6:6:55	6:7:13	and 
301	6:7:13	6:8:5	after the circle 
302	6:8:5	6:9:5	uhm 
303	6:9:5	6:10:12	IY move to the leave 
304	6:10:12	6:10:58	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
306	6:12:1	6:12:43	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
307	6:12:43	6:12:51	like three inch 
308	6:12:51	6:14:31	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
310	6:15:29	6:15:30	ok 
311	6:15:30	6:16:11	IY go straight down 
312	6:16:11	6:17:32	uh like 
313	6:17:32	6:17:49	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
316	6:19:55	6:21:36	uhm 
318	6:22:33	6:24:31	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
320	6:25:3	6:25:48	be the plane crash 
321	6:25:48	6:25:58	like 
322	6:25:58	6:26:11	to right 
325	6:28:31	6:29:20	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
327	6:30:42	6:31:18	IY be go like 
329	6:31:41	6:33:4	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
330	6:33:4	6:33:36	and IY should have a straight line there 
333	6:34:47	6:35:26	ok 
334	6:35:26	6:36:48	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
336	6:37:45	6:38:56	around the bottom of it 
338	6:39:24	6:39:30	ok 
340	6:39:41	6:40:19	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish

42	1:47:3	1:47:22	uh IY do n know know what to say 
43	1:47:22	1:49:2	plane crash IY do n think be yeah 
44	1:49:2	1:51:1	it  not like in the same place IY be describe 
46	1:51:8	1:52:54	mm mm 
49	1:56:10	1:57:50	IY be start yeah the stony desert 
52	2:0:15	2:1:27	yeah

65	2:11:16	2:11:26	ok 
70	2:16:54	2:17:28	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
71	2:17:28	2:17:55	so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
73	2:19:7	2:19:19	ok 
76	2:20:37	2:22:17	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
77	2:22:17	2:23:6	ok

106	2:48:55	2:50:25	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
108	2:51:31	2:52:13	and there  a collapse shelter 
110	2:53:51	2:54:3	ok 
117	3:0:48	3:1:13	to the right 
120	3:3:12	3:3:40	ok

39	1:43:7	1:44:52	maybe four inch on the paper 
40	1:44:52	1:46:41	and there  a plane crash 
45	1:51:1	1:51:8	plane crash 
47	1:52:54	1:54:39	uhm 
48	1:54:39	1:56:10	alright be IY start near the 
50	1:57:50	1:58:49	be IY 
51	1:58:49	2:0:15	IY be start at the stony desert 
53	2:1:27	2:2:43	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
55	2:2:45	2:3:0	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
56	2:3:0	2:4:49	not right at the stony desert 
58	2:6:20	2:7:7	ok and then IY be go 
60	2:8:6	2:8:22	to the leave 
61	2:8:22	2:8:52	like an inch

66	2:11:26	2:12:7	and then IY go 
67	2:12:7	2:14:6	like four or five inch to the leave 
68	2:14:6	2:15:36	and  where the plane crash be 
69	2:15:36	2:16:54	be IY anywhere near there 
72	2:17:55	2:19:7	four or five inch to the leave 
74	2:19:19	2:19:26	and then 
75	2:19:26	2:20:37	after plane crash 
78	2:23:6	2:24:3	ok plane crash be n there 
79	2:24:3	2:25:11	uhm 
80	2:25:11	2:25:42	alright well IY will keep go and see 
81	2:25:42	2:26:2	alright

83	2:27:21	2:27:33	uhm 
84	2:27:33	2:28:23	IY be at the plane crash 
85	2:28:23	2:29:22	and 
86	2:29:22	2:29:56	IY wanna kind of curve 
87	2:29:56	2:30:21	a little

101	2:42:34	2:44:28	away about like four inch four or five inch 
102	2:44:28	2:46:4	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
103	2:46:4	2:46:22	be IY anywere near there 
105	2:47:25	2:48:55	ok 
107	2:50:25	2:51:31	yes

111	2:54:3	2:55:40	ok 
112	2:55:40	2:56:6	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
113	2:56:6	2:57:58	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
114	2:57:58	2:58:33	just a slight slope 
115	2:58:33	3:0:21	about like 
116	3:0:21	3:0:48	an inch maybe a little bit less 
118	3:1:13	3:2:59	to the right

139	3:26:58	3:27:34	well 
140	3:27:34	3:27:52	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all

144	3:30:32	3:32:30	ok IY be at the savannah 
145	3:32:30	3:32:33	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
146	3:32:33	3:32:52	like 
147	3:32:52	3:34:36	three inch 
149	3:35:55	3:37:9	and IY be go straight up 
150	3:37:9	3:38:26	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
152	3:39:1	3:40:56	ok well 
153	3:40:56	3:41:0	probably the same thing 
156	3:42:47	3:44:39	where be IY right now start at the savannah

166	3:51:44	3:52:54	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
167	3:52:54	3:53:18	the slate mountain be towards the right 
168	3:53:18	3:53:18	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
169	3:53:18	3:54:59	be IY in like 
170	3:54:59	3:55:57	be IY in like almost the top of the 
172	3:56:35	3:56:43	no IY have 
173	3:56:43	3:58:15	maybe IY have different thing 
174	3:58:15	3:59:13	well alright 
176	4:0:54	4:2:42	alright alright well just 
177	4:2:42	4:2:55	just do it like this ok 
178	4:2:55	4:4:29	go up like three three and a half inch 
180	4:5:26	4:6:53	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
182	4:8:37	4:9:28	it  right next to it 
183	4:9:28	4:11:4	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
185	4:12:8	4:12:49	maybe like 
186	4:12:49	4:14:10	a quarter of an inch 
187	4:14:10	4:15:44	to the leave of little path where path should be 
190	4:18:41	4:20:15	ok 
191	4:20:15	4:20:30	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
192	4:20:30	4:20:58	for like 
193	4:20:58	4:22:22	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
195	4:23:0	4:23:39	and then IY slope down to the leave 
196	4:23:39	4:25:31	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
198	4:25:52	4:27:8	ok 
199	4:27:8	4:28:7	and then 
200	4:28:7	4:29:56	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
202	4:31:9	4:31:54	ok 
203	4:31:54	4:33:41	so IY be at the hot spring 
204	4:33:41	4:34:47	and IY be slope to the leave 
205	4:34:47	4:34:50	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
207	4:36:29	4:36:50	ok 
208	4:36:50	4:38:25	and then 
209	4:38:25	4:38:56	uhm 
210	4:38:56	4:39:19	IY slope down again 
212	4:39:27	4:40:20	uhm 
213	4:40:20	4:42:2	no there  no elephant 
214	4:42:2	4:43:6	on sheet anyway 
217	4:44:11	4:44:38	no 
218	4:44:38	4:45:16	IY be just go down 
219	4:45:16	4:46:31	like IY be slope 
220	4:46:31	4:47:20	and slope be about an inch long 
221	4:47:20	4:49:4	and be to the leave 
223	4:50:2	4:51:58	ok 
224	4:51:58	4:53:35	and then 
225	4:53:35	4:55:5	uhm 
226	4:55:5	4:56:26	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
227	4:56:26	4:57:48	to the leave 
229	4:59:22	4:59:22	ok 
230	4:59:22	4:59:43	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
232	5:0:13	5:1:9	to the white mountain 
234	5:2:31	5:2:43	ok 
235	5:2:43	5:2:43	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
236	5:2:43	5:3:37	and it slope a little bit to the right 
237	5:3:37	5:4:8	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
239	5:5:9	5:6:3	ok 
240	5:6:3	5:6:3	so  about IY would say 
241	5:6:3	5:6:34	 about five or six inch 
243	5:6:55	5:6:59	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
245	5:7:47	5:8:25	uhm IY straighten out slope 
246	5:8:25	5:9:22	and IY just go straight up 
247	5:9:22	5:11:13	for about two inch 
248	5:11:13	5:12:14	ok 
250	5:13:49	5:15:25	then

257	5:20:51	5:21:16	uhm 
258	5:21:16	5:22:33	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
259	5:22:33	5:23:38	and then IY slope 
260	5:23:38	5:24:27	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
262	5:24:41	5:26:27	yes IY be go towards the lake 
264	5:27:42	5:28:36	but 
265	5:28:36	5:29:54	IY be go about 
266	5:29:54	5:30:40	three inch straight across 
267	5:30:40	5:31:50	to the lake 
268	5:31:50	5:32:32	and then IY be 
269	5:32:32	5:33:47	IY get 
271	5:35:46	5:36:23	uhm 
272	5:36:23	5:37:22	no 
273	5:37:22	5:39:21	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
274	5:39:21	5:40:36	so IY go three inch straight 
275	5:40:36	5:41:36	and then IY slope up 
276	5:41:36	5:42:40	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
278	5:43:0	5:44:10	the 
279	5:44:10	5:44:27	what 
281	5:45:7	5:46:52	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
283	5:47:51	5:49:37	ok 
284	5:49:37	5:49:53	and then 
285	5:49:53	5:51:21	uhm 
286	5:51:21	5:53:11	right next to circle should be roman bath 
287	5:53:11	5:54:50	do IY have roman bath 
289	5:55:17	5:57:5	ok well 
290	5:57:5	5:57:30	they be there 
291	5:57:30	5:58:34	so anyway

294	6:0:27	6:2:23	what 
296	6:2:55	6:4:8	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
297	6:4:8	6:4:42	so IY make circle 
300	6:6:55	6:7:13	and 
301	6:7:13	6:8:5	after the circle 
302	6:8:5	6:9:5	uhm 
303	6:9:5	6:10:12	IY move to the leave 
304	6:10:12	6:10:58	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
306	6:12:1	6:12:43	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
