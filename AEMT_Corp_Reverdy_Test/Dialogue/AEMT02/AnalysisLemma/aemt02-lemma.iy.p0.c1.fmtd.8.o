start
0:0:40	0:0:48	g	plane crash 
0:1:10	0:1:11	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
0:1:49	0:1:56	f	ok 
0:5:43	0:5:44	f	ok 
0:5:49	0:5:51	g	and IY be go up like 
0:6:46	0:6:55	g	uhm 
0:8:35	0:8:40	f	ok 
0:8:42	0:8:49	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
0:10:21	0:10:26	g	IY slope down again 
0:12:54	0:12:54	g	like an inch 
0:13:38	0:13:40	g	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
0:14:57	0:15:4	f	mm hmm 
0:16:19	0:16:20	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
0:16:18	0:16:21	f	and then what 
0:18:30	0:18:34	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
0:21:18	0:21:22	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
0:21:20	0:21:24	g	alright 
0:21:28	0:21:34	g	IY be go about 
0:22:25	0:22:33	g	and IY be go 
0:24:43	0:24:44	g	well 
0:25:7	0:25:13	f	elephant 
0:25:44	0:25:50	g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
0:26:8	0:26:15	g	ok 
0:28:0	0:28:2	g	ok 
0:29:10	0:29:19	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
0:30:5	0:30:9	f	ok 
0:38:2	0:38:10	g	like IY be slope 
0:39:27	0:39:27	g	ok 
0:40:12	0:40:19	g	ok 
0:40:29	0:40:35	f	mm hmm 
0:42:6	0:42:15	g	but 
0:44:5	0:44:6	g	maybe IY have different thing 
0:44:15	0:44:23	g	then 
0:44:46	0:44:48	g	and 
0:46:12	0:46:21	g	like 
0:46:59	0:47:6	g	so IY go three inch straight 
0:47:28	0:47:31	g	no IY do n have a waterhole 
0:47:57	0:48:0	g	and then 
0:48:19	0:48:20	f	uh IY do n know know what to say 
0:48:56	0:48:58	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
0:49:1	0:49:6	f	to the right 
0:49:19	0:49:20	g	like four or five inch to the leave 
0:51:5	0:51:8	g	IY be actually start like right 
0:51:51	0:51:58	f	ok 
0:58:13	0:58:17	f	nope 
0:59:10	0:59:12	g	probably the same thing 
0:59:25	0:59:32	g	uhm 
0:59:32	0:59:39	g	four or five inch to the leave 
1:0:31	1:0:33	g	five 
1:0:52	1:1:1	f	so wait 
1:3:2	1:3:7	g	IY be start at the stony desert 
1:3:54	1:4:2	g	be IY in like almost the top of the 
1:4:40	1:4:41	g	ok IY be at the savannah 
1:4:37	1:4:45	g	uhm 
1:5:43	1:5:50	g	ok 
1:8:2	1:8:9	g	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
1:8:14	1:8:16	f	ok 
1:8:25	1:8:25	f	ok 
1:9:24	1:9:28	f	mm mm 
1:9:24	1:9:29	f	and there  a collapse shelter 
1:9:45	1:9:51	g	maybe 
1:12:31	1:12:40	g	no IY have 
1:12:51	1:12:59	f	ok 
1:13:43	1:13:44	g	a quarter of an inch 
1:14:1	1:14:5	f	around the top of the lake 
1:14:15	1:14:17	g	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
1:15:9	1:15:18	g	be IY 
1:16:4	1:16:12	g	uhm 
1:17:45	1:17:51	g	be IY anywhere near there 
1:17:54	1:17:59	f	IY be three inch above the savannah 
1:20:26	1:20:32	g	ok well 
1:21:20	1:21:25	f	IY hit some round rock 
1:23:29	1:23:34	g	couple mile or something 
1:23:56	1:24:1	g	after IY go straight again 
1:26:25	1:26:26	g	just do it like this ok 
1:27:7	1:27:14	g	alright 
1:27:49	1:27:55	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
1:30:14	1:30:18	g	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
1:30:45	1:30:49	g	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
1:31:11	1:31:15	g	and then 
1:35:43	1:35:43	g	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
1:40:47	1:40:51	g	on sheet anyway 
1:44:0	1:44:9	g	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
1:44:11	1:44:13	g	for like 
1:44:35	1:44:39	g	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
1:47:33	1:47:35	f	oh 
1:47:59	1:48:4	g	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
1:49:41	1:49:44	g	uhm and there be a stony desert 
1:52:17	1:52:18	g	so  about IY would say 
1:53:11	1:53:17	g	uhm 
1:53:23	1:53:23	f	and to the right 
1:53:49	1:53:53	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
1:54:48	1:54:48	f	up tp the right 
1:55:10	1:55:13	g	ok 
1:55:30	1:55:32	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
1:56:0	1:56:2	g	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
1:57:43	1:57:46	g	straight up 
1:58:57	1:59:0	f	ok 
2:2:42	2:2:49	g	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
2:3:30	2:3:39	g	ok 
2:3:38	2:3:41	g	alright be IY start near the 
2:4:34	2:4:35	g	ok 
2:5:14	2:5:18	f	plane crash IY do n think be yeah 
2:7:7	2:7:15	g	ok 
2:8:22	2:8:31	g	from 
2:9:14	2:9:16	g	to the leave 
2:9:37	2:9:45	g	and then 
2:9:51	2:9:54	g	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
2:10:10	2:10:18	f	it  not like in the same place IY be describe 
2:13:46	2:13:50	f	ok wait hold on 
2:14:42	2:14:46	f	IY hit some rock though 
2:18:21	2:18:21	g	to right 
2:18:29	2:18:33	g	ok 
2:18:32	2:18:36	f	ok 
2:18:50	2:18:52	f	ok 
2:19:13	2:19:20	g	just a slight slope 
2:22:51	2:22:57	g	kind of across from stony desert 
2:23:57	2:24:2	f	around the lake to the top 
2:25:55	2:25:57	f	ok 
2:26:6	2:26:12	g	and then IY will come to a savannah 
2:26:22	2:26:27	f	yeah 
2:26:47	2:26:50	g	no there  no elephant 
2:27:47	2:27:50	g	to the lake 
2:27:46	2:27:50	g	and then 
2:29:27	2:29:35	g	well alright 
2:29:55	2:30:3	g	uhm 
2:33:31	2:33:35	f	to the leave 
2:33:42	2:33:50	g	and then 
2:34:42	2:34:46	f	IY be start yeah the stony desert 
2:34:47	2:34:55	g	so IY be at the hot spring 
2:37:13	2:37:20	f	ok 
2:39:0	2:39:9	g	to the leave 
2:41:34	2:41:38	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
2:41:56	2:41:59	f	mm hmm 
2:46:20	2:46:20	f	to 
2:46:27	2:46:29	f	IY be at the savannah 
2:48:10	2:48:10	g	ok 
2:48:10	2:48:14	g	after plane crash 
2:49:17	2:49:20	g	and then IY slope down to the leave 
2:49:49	2:49:58	g	uhm 
2:52:0	2:52:3	g	ok 
2:53:40	2:53:49	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
2:54:5	2:54:13	g	and IY be slope to the leave 
2:54:10	2:54:18	f	ok 
2:55:12	2:55:13	f	do IY go around it 
2:55:29	2:55:33	f	ok 
2:58:2	2:58:3	f	and 
2:58:9	2:58:18	g	uhm 
3:0:19	3:0:23	g	IY have a waterhole on map 
3:1:43	3:1:48	g	yes IY be go towards the lake 
3:5:16	3:5:23	g	go up like three three and a half inch 
3:7:3	3:7:11	g	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
3:7:22	3:7:26	f	ok 
3:9:2	3:9:6	g	they be there 
3:9:40	3:9:40	g	and 
3:9:37	3:9:42	f	yeah 
3:11:57	3:11:58	g	IY be kind of go 
3:12:34	3:12:38	f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
3:15:23	3:15:26	g	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
3:15:31	3:15:33	f	yep 
3:15:38	3:15:38	g	it  right next to it 
3:17:1	3:17:5	f	ok 
3:17:27	3:17:36	g	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
3:18:9	3:18:16	g	ok 
3:18:16	3:18:24	g	and then IY be go down 
3:19:4	3:19:6	f	ok 
3:20:19	3:20:19	f	IY know IY have different thing so 
3:23:14	3:23:19	g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
3:24:26	3:24:30	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
3:24:50	3:24:55	g	and IY just go straight up 
3:24:57	3:25:2	g	ok and then IY be go 
3:25:29	3:25:36	g	IY go straight down 
3:25:30	3:25:38	f	ok 
3:27:43	3:27:47	g	slight 
3:28:23	3:28:30	g	ok 
3:28:33	3:28:40	g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
3:30:42	3:30:44	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
3:32:37	3:32:42	f	yeah 
3:33:2	3:33:7	g	yes 
3:34:40	3:34:46	g	ok 
3:35:12	3:35:14	g	IY would say 
3:36:38	3:36:46	f	to the leave of the antelope 
3:37:39	3:37:45	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
3:37:49	3:37:54	g	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
3:38:57	3:39:5	g	uhm 
3:39:22	3:39:30	g	be the plane crash 
3:39:28	3:39:30	f	yeah 
3:41:4	3:41:10	g	alright alright well just 
3:42:36	3:42:45	g	there  a there  
3:42:41	3:42:50	g	no 
3:45:32	3:45:32	g	be IY anywere near there 
3:46:42	3:46:48	g	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
3:46:51	3:46:51	g	IY be just go down 
3:47:3	3:47:12	g	ok 
3:47:26	3:47:28	g	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
3:48:56	3:48:56	g	no 
3:49:55	3:50:2	g	do IY have roman bath 
3:50:3	3:50:8	f	ok 
3:50:25	3:50:29	g	IY be at the plane crash 
3:51:23	3:51:29	g	well just 
3:52:58	3:53:6	f	no IY will go with hot spring IY have 
3:53:44	3:53:52	g	 little slope 
3:54:6	3:54:14	g	like 
3:54:45	3:54:45	g	uhm IY straighten out slope 
3:55:1	3:55:2	g	and then 
3:58:2	3:58:7	f	yeah 
3:58:40	3:58:48	g	 about five or six inch 
3:59:50	3:59:59	g	uhm 
4:0:57	4:1:2	g	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
4:2:55	4:2:58	g	three inch straight across 
4:3:2	4:3:2	g	three inch 
4:3:39	4:3:42	g	uhm 
4:4:5	4:4:7	g	ok 
4:5:43	4:5:43	f	mm hmm 
4:6:47	4:6:49	f	ok 
4:7:8	4:7:12	g	to the right 
4:7:18	4:7:26	g	ok 
4:7:48	4:7:57	g	what 
4:8:40	4:8:40	g	have a s 
4:12:20	4:12:29	f	ok 
4:12:51	4:13:0	g	uhm 
4:13:32	4:13:33	g	and 
4:14:9	4:14:15	g	couple inch IY be slope down 
4:15:1	4:15:5	g	well 
4:15:19	4:15:22	g	so anyway 
4:15:54	4:15:57	g	so IY make circle 
4:18:27	4:18:28	g	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
4:19:12	4:19:19	g	maybe like 
4:19:36	4:19:40	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
4:21:0	4:21:3	f	and curve down to the leave 
4:21:21	4:21:27	g	ok 
4:21:31	4:21:33	g	maybe like 
4:21:40	4:21:43	g	away about like four inch four or five inch 
4:21:51	4:21:52	g	like maybe an inch 
4:22:8	4:22:9	g	after the circle 
4:23:47	4:23:53	g	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
4:26:20	4:26:26	g	a little 
4:28:50	4:28:56	g	a little bit too 
4:28:59	4:29:6	g	IY just kind of slope down 
4:29:8	4:29:17	g	ok 
4:31:18	4:31:25	f	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
4:31:27	4:31:29	g	and then IY go straight 
4:31:45	4:31:46	g	maybe four inch on the paper 
4:31:43	4:31:52	f	yeah 
4:32:3	4:32:10	f	so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
4:33:0	4:33:0	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
4:33:24	4:33:28	f	IY have to back up a little bit 
4:33:30	4:33:36	f	but  like five six inch from where IY be now 
4:33:50	4:33:54	f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
4:36:47	4:36:56	g	and then IY slope 
4:36:52	4:36:57	f	yeah IY see 
4:38:3	4:38:7	g	to the white mountain 
4:40:2	4:40:11	g	and then IY go 
4:43:53	4:43:56	g	for about two inch 
4:45:17	4:45:21	g	the 
4:45:21	4:45:24	g	for like 
4:50:13	4:50:16	g	uhm 
4:51:9	4:51:15	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
4:51:32	4:51:35	g	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
4:51:53	4:52:0	g	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
4:54:6	4:54:15	g	and there  a plane crash 
4:55:13	4:55:21	g	no IY do n have any rock 
4:55:28	4:55:28	f	ok 
4:55:35	4:55:36	g	uhm 
4:58:58	4:59:1	f	yeah 
4:59:50	4:59:59	g	be IY in like 
5:1:49	5:1:58	g	IY get 
5:2:25	5:2:25	g	and then IY be 
5:3:2	5:3:9	g	about like 
5:3:50	5:3:54	g	IY be slope 
5:5:14	5:5:20	f	IY have a plane crash though 
5:5:29	5:5:35	g	alright well IY will keep go and see 
5:5:52	5:5:57	g	and slope be about an inch long 
5:6:23	5:6:31	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
5:6:29	5:6:33	g	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
5:6:42	5:6:51	g	it  not a big curve 
5:9:20	5:9:26	f	do IY go through anything 
5:10:23	5:10:28	g	what 
5:10:43	5:10:47	g	ok well 
5:13:50	5:13:58	g	an inch maybe a little bit less 
5:14:48	5:14:56	g	IY be go like 
5:15:35	5:15:42	g	after IY slope down IY will say 
5:16:16	5:16:21	g	ok 
5:16:21	5:16:23	g	and then 
5:18:22	5:18:29	g	not right at the stony desert 
5:19:59	5:20:2	g	yes 
5:21:36	5:21:40	g	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
5:21:48	5:21:55	g	IY move to the leave 
5:22:44	5:22:46	f	yeah and IY go straight up 
5:23:34	5:23:41	g	and 
5:23:58	5:24:3	g	and then IY you go up 
5:28:6	5:28:6	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
5:29:3	5:29:9	g	uhm 
5:29:42	5:29:47	f	how many inch do IY think 
5:30:1	5:30:5	f	mm hmm 
5:30:48	5:30:49	f	IY have plane crash IY be talk about earlier  up there 
5:33:23	5:33:29	f	ok 
5:37:38	5:37:47	g	ok 
5:37:49	5:37:54	g	ok plane crash be n there 
5:39:11	5:39:20	g	ok 
5:39:36	5:39:38	g	IY make 
5:40:45	5:40:45	g	and be to the leave 
5:42:37	5:42:39	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
5:42:39	5:42:40	g	uh like 
5:46:4	5:46:6	g	like three inch 
5:47:52	5:47:57	g	and  where the plane crash be
