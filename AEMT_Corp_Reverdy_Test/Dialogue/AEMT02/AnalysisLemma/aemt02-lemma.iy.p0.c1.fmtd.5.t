start g
1	0:8:31	0:8:35	uhm 
2	0:11:56	0:12:4	 little slope 
4	0:14:55	0:15:2	well just 
5	0:15:24	0:15:31	uh like 
6	0:15:40	0:15:42	to the leave of little path where path should be 
7	0:18:18	0:18:23	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
8	0:21:38	0:21:46	uhm 
9	0:22:36	0:22:36	probably the same thing 
10	0:24:32	0:24:39	about like 
12	0:25:56	0:25:58	they be there 
14	0:27:3	0:27:8	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
15	0:28:52	0:28:56	ok IY be at the savannah 
16	0:29:10	0:29:19	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
17	0:32:35	0:32:38	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
18	0:34:35	0:34:41	like an inch

20	0:39:12	0:39:13	ok 
22	0:41:5	0:41:9	and then IY go 
23	0:45:26	0:45:34	maybe 
24	0:47:37	0:47:46	after the circle 
25	0:49:23	0:49:27	and then 
26	0:51:5	0:51:12	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
30	0:56:44	0:56:47	ok well 
31	0:57:10	0:57:12	for about two inch 
33	0:58:0	0:58:0	uhm

35	1:2:23	1:2:29	alright 
37	1:6:6	1:6:7	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
38	1:6:40	1:6:48	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
39	1:7:34	1:7:34	uhm and there be a stony desert 
41	1:9:52	1:10:0	ok 
42	1:10:28	1:10:33	and IY be slope to the leave 
43	1:11:39	1:11:41	after plane crash 
44	1:12:2	1:12:10	no IY do n have any rock 
45	1:12:34	1:12:38	ok 
47	1:13:57	1:14:5	alright well IY will keep go and see 
48	1:14:12	1:14:17	and be to the leave 
49	1:14:38	1:14:38	and 
51	1:19:20	1:19:20	uhm 
52	1:21:19	1:21:21	uhm 
53	1:22:14	1:22:21	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
54	1:22:25	1:22:30	an inch maybe a little bit less 
55	1:23:23	1:23:24	just a slight slope 
56	1:24:29	1:24:31	IY 
57	1:25:38	1:25:44	ok 
58	1:25:54	1:26:0	uhm 
59	1:28:33	1:28:33	ok 
60	1:28:32	1:28:40	after IY slope down IY will say 
61	1:29:27	1:29:30	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
62	1:29:57	1:29:58	like IY be slope 
63	1:30:47	1:30:48	like 
64	1:34:40	1:34:47	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
65	1:34:56	1:35:2	and IY be go up like 
66	1:35:28	1:35:31	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
67	1:35:31	1:35:31	and then IY will come to a savannah 
69	1:37:13	1:37:14	be IY anywhere near there 
71	1:37:29	1:37:33	ok 
73	1:38:6	1:38:7	and then IY slope 
77	1:41:45	1:41:46	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
78	1:43:14	1:43:17	no 
80	1:45:30	1:45:31	and IY be go 
81	1:46:8	1:46:9	ok and then IY be go 
82	1:46:40	1:46:42	there  a there  
83	1:47:53	1:47:59	so IY make circle 
85	1:50:35	1:50:41	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
86	1:50:58	1:51:0	for like 
87	1:51:28	1:51:35	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
88	1:53:29	1:53:35	uhm 
89	1:53:29	1:53:36	plane crash 
91	1:55:25	1:55:33	alright 
92	1:57:0	1:57:0	go up like three three and a half inch 
93	1:59:18	1:59:27	uhm 
94	2:0:7	2:0:14	uhm 
95	2:3:56	2:3:57	it  like a slight little upwards to the right

100	2:5:53	2:5:55	uhm 
101	2:5:56	2:6:4	IY wanna kind of curve 
103	2:7:12	2:7:16	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
104	2:8:56	2:9:3	IY be go about 
105	2:14:57	2:14:58	be IY in like 
106	2:15:38	2:15:45	ok 
107	2:17:38	2:17:41	so 
108	2:17:49	2:17:58	ok

116	2:28:56	2:28:59	yes 
118	2:30:9	2:30:10	alright be IY start near the 
119	2:32:33	2:32:33	IY be start at the stony desert 
120	2:33:8	2:33:17	to the right 
121	2:35:24	2:35:33	and 
122	2:37:49	2:37:56	and there  a plane crash 
123	2:38:42	2:38:44	couple inch IY be slope down 
124	2:38:40	2:38:49	IY move to the leave 
125	2:39:33	2:39:37	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
126	2:39:56	2:40:5	ok 
127	2:41:55	2:42:1	three inch 
128	2:42:25	2:42:29	it  not a big curve 
131	2:48:5	2:48:7	and then 
132	2:48:43	2:48:47	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
133	2:49:7	2:49:14	do IY have roman bath 
134	2:52:5	2:52:7	then 
135	2:52:33	2:52:36	to the lake 
137	2:59:10	2:59:10	the 
138	2:59:14	2:59:19	and then 
139	3:1:40	3:1:48	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
140	3:2:50	3:2:56	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
141	3:8:29	3:8:35	maybe IY have different thing 
142	3:10:8	3:10:15	and then IY slope up 
143	3:10:35	3:10:38	ok well 
144	3:11:24	3:11:25	be IY 
146	3:12:30	3:12:38	have a s 
147	3:12:45	3:12:48	a little 
151	3:13:15	3:13:21	and IY just go straight up 
152	3:13:17	3:13:23	not right at the stony desert 
153	3:13:27	3:13:28	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
154	3:13:53	3:13:57	so  about IY would say 
157	3:18:14	3:18:23	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
159	3:23:6	3:23:10	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
160	3:23:16	3:23:16	and 
161	3:23:58	3:24:1	just do it like this ok 
162	3:25:39	3:25:45	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there

164	3:28:12	3:28:20	ok 
165	3:29:3	3:29:5	uhm 
168	3:32:48	3:32:53	to right 
170	3:33:24	3:33:28	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
171	3:34:27	3:34:29	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
172	3:36:33	3:36:39	hmm 
175	3:40:36	3:40:41	and slope be about an inch long 
176	3:40:46	3:40:52	to the leave 
178	3:45:50	3:45:51	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
179	3:47:18	3:47:20	like three inch 
180	3:47:20	3:47:20	uhm 
181	3:47:20	3:47:20	and  where the plane crash be 
185	3:48:55	3:49:0	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
188	3:51:27	3:51:27	no there  no elephant 
189	3:52:21	3:52:21	yes 
191	3:59:0	3:59:9	and then 
193	4:4:12	4:4:19	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
194	4:4:43	4:4:49	but 
195	4:5:51	4:5:52	yes IY be go towards the lake 
197	4:7:18	4:7:24	uhm 
198	4:8:49	4:8:50	ok 
199	4:10:33	4:10:39	what 
200	4:10:48	4:10:55	IY be at the plane crash 
203	4:14:3	4:14:8	maybe like 
205	4:14:39	4:14:42	uhm 
206	4:16:38	4:16:47	uhm 
207	4:17:14	4:17:17	and then IY slope down to the leave 
208	4:18:21	4:18:27	and IY should have a straight line there 
209	4:19:51	4:19:58	ok 
211	4:20:26	4:20:28	ok 
212	4:20:43	4:20:52	IY do n know 
213	4:22:38	4:22:41	ok 
214	4:23:28	4:23:30	IY just kind of slope down 
215	4:24:55	4:25:1	and it slope a little bit to the right 
216	4:24:59	4:25:4	IY be just go down 
217	4:25:5	4:25:11	a quarter of an inch 
218	4:25:44	4:25:47	after IY go straight again 
219	4:28:7	4:28:13	to the leave 
220	4:29:8	4:29:8	kind of across from stony desert 
221	4:30:11	4:30:17	be the plane crash 
222	4:30:31	4:30:37	it  right next to it 
223	4:31:31	4:31:39	and then 
224	4:32:26	4:32:33	away about like four inch four or five inch 
225	4:33:30	4:33:36	ok 
227	4:34:22	4:34:26	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
228	4:35:1	4:35:4	IY would say 
231	4:38:44	4:38:50	and then IY be go down 
232	4:39:2	4:39:5	ok 
236	4:42:57	4:43:1	a little bit too 
237	4:43:12	4:43:20	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
238	4:45:5	4:45:8	no IY do n have a waterhole 
240	4:46:13	4:46:20	IY have a waterhole on map 
241	4:46:48	4:46:54	to the white mountain 
242	4:47:2	4:47:8	what 
244	4:47:51	4:47:56	slight 
247	4:52:22	4:52:23	ok 
248	4:53:36	4:53:44	well alright 
249	4:53:44	4:53:49	and then 
250	4:54:31	4:54:37	and then 
251	4:54:58	4:55:6	on sheet anyway 
252	4:58:31	4:58:31	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
253	4:58:45	4:58:52	ok 
255	5:1:16	5:1:23	like 
256	5:1:32	5:1:35	ok 
257	5:3:19	5:3:27	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
258	5:4:9	5:4:16	to the leave 
260	5:7:13	5:7:16	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
261	5:10:1	5:10:3	and IY be go straight up 
262	5:10:11	5:10:18	ok 
264	5:11:43	5:11:43	like maybe an inch 
265	5:12:51	5:12:54	IY go straight down 
266	5:15:7	5:15:15	uhm IY straighten out slope 
269	5:18:49	5:18:51	so anyway 
270	5:19:50	5:19:50	uhm 
271	5:20:53	5:20:54	well 
272	5:22:55	5:23:0	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
273	5:23:57	5:24:6	straight up 
274	5:26:51	5:26:57	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
277	5:30:4	5:30:9	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
278	5:30:9	5:30:14	IY be actually start like right 
279	5:32:44	5:32:47	from 
281	5:33:58	5:34:4	so IY be at the hot spring 
282	5:34:44	5:34:48	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
283	5:36:14	5:36:21	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
284	5:36:44	5:36:46	and then 
287	5:41:55	5:41:57	ok 
288	5:44:49	5:44:52	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
291	5:47:1	5:47:8	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
292	5:47:19	5:47:22	and 
293	5:48:4	5:48:6	couple mile or something 
294	5:48:47	5:48:47	IY be kind of go 
295	5:49:44	5:49:46	three inch 
297	5:51:15	5:51:21	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
298	5:53:40	5:53:40	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
299	5:54:31	5:54:37	IY slope down again 
300	5:54:37	5:54:39	ok plane crash be n there 
301	5:55:29	5:55:35	and then IY you go up 
302	5:59:3	5:59:10	the slate mountain be towards the right 
305	6:1:31	6:1:37	uhm 
310	6:7:12	6:7:18	and then IY be 
312	6:7:39	6:7:46	like four or five inch to the leave 
313	6:8:29	6:8:32	right next to circle should be roman bath 
314	6:10:16	6:10:16	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
315	6:10:24	6:10:25	ok 
319	6:14:16	6:14:19	IY be slope 
320	6:15:43	6:15:51	three inch straight across 
321	6:16:9	6:16:14	alright alright well just 
323	6:18:22	6:18:23	maybe like 
324	6:18:22	6:18:28	IY be start 
327	6:20:50	6:20:53	ok 
328	6:22:40	6:22:40	be IY in like almost the top of the 
329	6:27:24	6:27:29	maybe four inch on the paper 
330	6:28:48	6:28:51	IY be go like 
331	6:29:11	6:29:14	be IY anywere near there 
334	6:31:37	6:31:44	around the bottom of it 
335	6:31:50	6:31:54	and then IY go straight 
336	6:32:11	6:32:11	like 
337	6:32:38	6:32:39	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
338	6:34:15	6:34:15	 about five or six inch 
339	6:34:58	6:34:59	like 
341	6:36:25	6:36:27	four or five inch to the leave 
342	6:36:45	6:36:54	so IY go three inch straight 
start f
0	0:7:52	0:7:53	mm mm 
3	0:12:31	0:12:35	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
11	0:24:54	0:24:57	yeah 
13	0:26:59	0:27:5	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
21	0:39:13	0:39:16	plane crash IY do n think be yeah 
27	0:52:27	0:52:34	yeah IY see 
28	0:53:49	0:53:56	ok 
29	0:55:29	0:55:29	and there  a collapse shelter 
32	0:57:22	0:57:23	IY go to a lake 
36	1:2:37	1:2:37	ok 
40	1:9:43	1:9:51	around the top of the lake 
46	1:14:2	1:14:4	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
50	1:14:44	1:14:51	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
68	1:35:37	1:35:38	yeah 
70	1:37:19	1:37:26	ok 
72	1:37:48	1:37:55	ok 
74	1:39:15	1:39:16	nope IY have a white mountain 
75	1:40:26	1:40:33	do IY go by the plane crash 
76	1:41:6	1:41:13	ok 
79	1:44:56	1:45:1	ok 
84	1:50:26	1:50:35	ok 
90	1:55:3	1:55:9	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
97	2:5:12	2:5:17	IY hit some round rock 
99	2:5:32	2:5:33	ok 
102	2:6:52	2:6:59	ok 
115	2:26:54	2:26:58	ok

130	2:47:34	2:47:42	uh IY do n know know what to say 
136	2:53:47	2:53:48	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
145	3:12:28	3:12:33	IY be start yeah the stony desert 
148	3:13:6	3:13:13	do IY go around it 
149	3:13:8	3:13:14	mm hmm 
150	3:13:11	3:13:17	to the leave

25	0:49:23	0:49:27	and then 
26	0:51:5	0:51:12	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
30	0:56:44	0:56:47	ok well 
31	0:57:10	0:57:12	for about two inch 
33	0:58:0	0:58:0	uhm

39	1:7:34	1:7:34	uhm and there be a stony desert 
41	1:9:52	1:10:0	ok 
42	1:10:28	1:10:33	and IY be slope to the leave 
43	1:11:39	1:11:41	after plane crash 
44	1:12:2	1:12:10	no IY do n have any rock 
45	1:12:34	1:12:38	ok 
47	1:13:57	1:14:5	alright well IY will keep go and see

60	1:28:32	1:28:40	after IY slope down IY will say 
61	1:29:27	1:29:30	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
62	1:29:57	1:29:58	like IY be slope 
63	1:30:47	1:30:48	like 
64	1:34:40	1:34:47	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
65	1:34:56	1:35:2	and IY be go up like 
66	1:35:28	1:35:31	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
67	1:35:31	1:35:31	and then IY will come to a savannah 
69	1:37:13	1:37:14	be IY anywhere near there 
71	1:37:29	1:37:33	ok 
73	1:38:6	1:38:7	and then IY slope

85	1:50:35	1:50:41	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
86	1:50:58	1:51:0	for like 
87	1:51:28	1:51:35	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
88	1:53:29	1:53:35	uhm 
89	1:53:29	1:53:36	plane crash 
91	1:55:25	1:55:33	alright 
92	1:57:0	1:57:0	go up like three three and a half inch 
93	1:59:18	1:59:27	uhm

121	2:35:24	2:35:33	and 
122	2:37:49	2:37:56	and there  a plane crash 
123	2:38:42	2:38:44	couple inch IY be slope down 
124	2:38:40	2:38:49	IY move to the leave 
125	2:39:33	2:39:37	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
126	2:39:56	2:40:5	ok 
127	2:41:55	2:42:1	three inch 
128	2:42:25	2:42:29	it  not a big curve 
131	2:48:5	2:48:7	and then 
132	2:48:43	2:48:47	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
133	2:49:7	2:49:14	do IY have roman bath 
134	2:52:5	2:52:7	then 
135	2:52:33	2:52:36	to the lake

138	2:59:14	2:59:19	and then 
139	3:1:40	3:1:48	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
140	3:2:50	3:2:56	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
141	3:8:29	3:8:35	maybe IY have different thing 
142	3:10:8	3:10:15	and then IY slope up 
143	3:10:35	3:10:38	ok well 
144	3:11:24	3:11:25	be IY 
146	3:12:30	3:12:38	have a s

151	3:13:15	3:13:21	and IY just go straight up 
152	3:13:17	3:13:23	not right at the stony desert 
153	3:13:27	3:13:28	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
154	3:13:53	3:13:57	so  about IY would say 
157	3:18:14	3:18:23	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
159	3:23:6	3:23:10	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
160	3:23:16	3:23:16	and 
161	3:23:58	3:24:1	just do it like this ok 
162	3:25:39	3:25:45	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there

168	3:32:48	3:32:53	to right 
170	3:33:24	3:33:28	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
171	3:34:27	3:34:29	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
172	3:36:33	3:36:39	hmm 
175	3:40:36	3:40:41	and slope be about an inch long 
176	3:40:46	3:40:52	to the leave 
178	3:45:50	3:45:51	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight

180	3:47:20	3:47:20	uhm 
181	3:47:20	3:47:20	and  where the plane crash be 
185	3:48:55	3:49:0	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
188	3:51:27	3:51:27	no there  no elephant 
189	3:52:21	3:52:21	yes 
191	3:59:0	3:59:9	and then 
193	4:4:12	4:4:19	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
194	4:4:43	4:4:49	but 
195	4:5:51	4:5:52	yes IY be go towards the lake

199	4:10:33	4:10:39	what 
200	4:10:48	4:10:55	IY be at the plane crash 
203	4:14:3	4:14:8	maybe like 
205	4:14:39	4:14:42	uhm 
206	4:16:38	4:16:47	uhm 
207	4:17:14	4:17:17	and then IY slope down to the leave 
208	4:18:21	4:18:27	and IY should have a straight line there 
209	4:19:51	4:19:58	ok 
211	4:20:26	4:20:28	ok 
212	4:20:43	4:20:52	IY do n know

215	4:24:55	4:25:1	and it slope a little bit to the right 
216	4:24:59	4:25:4	IY be just go down 
217	4:25:5	4:25:11	a quarter of an inch 
218	4:25:44	4:25:47	after IY go straight again 
219	4:28:7	4:28:13	to the leave 
220	4:29:8	4:29:8	kind of across from stony desert 
221	4:30:11	4:30:17	be the plane crash 
222	4:30:31	4:30:37	it  right next to it 
223	4:31:31	4:31:39	and then 
224	4:32:26	4:32:33	away about like four inch four or five inch 
225	4:33:30	4:33:36	ok

228	4:35:1	4:35:4	IY would say 
231	4:38:44	4:38:50	and then IY be go down 
232	4:39:2	4:39:5	ok 
236	4:42:57	4:43:1	a little bit too 
237	4:43:12	4:43:20	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
238	4:45:5	4:45:8	no IY do n have a waterhole 
240	4:46:13	4:46:20	IY have a waterhole on map 
241	4:46:48	4:46:54	to the white mountain 
242	4:47:2	4:47:8	what 
244	4:47:51	4:47:56	slight 
247	4:52:22	4:52:23	ok

250	4:54:31	4:54:37	and then 
251	4:54:58	4:55:6	on sheet anyway 
252	4:58:31	4:58:31	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
253	4:58:45	4:58:52	ok 
255	5:1:16	5:1:23	like 
256	5:1:32	5:1:35	ok 
257	5:3:19	5:3:27	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
258	5:4:9	5:4:16	to the leave 
260	5:7:13	5:7:16	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
261	5:10:1	5:10:3	and IY be go straight up 
262	5:10:11	5:10:18	ok 
264	5:11:43	5:11:43	like maybe an inch 
265	5:12:51	5:12:54	IY go straight down 
266	5:15:7	5:15:15	uhm IY straighten out slope 
269	5:18:49	5:18:51	so anyway 
270	5:19:50	5:19:50	uhm 
271	5:20:53	5:20:54	well 
272	5:22:55	5:23:0	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
273	5:23:57	5:24:6	straight up 
274	5:26:51	5:26:57	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
277	5:30:4	5:30:9	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
278	5:30:9	5:30:14	IY be actually start like right 
279	5:32:44	5:32:47	from 
281	5:33:58	5:34:4	so IY be at the hot spring 
282	5:34:44	5:34:48	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
283	5:36:14	5:36:21	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
284	5:36:44	5:36:46	and then 
287	5:41:55	5:41:57	ok 
288	5:44:49	5:44:52	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
291	5:47:1	5:47:8	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
292	5:47:19	5:47:22	and 
293	5:48:4	5:48:6	couple mile or something 
294	5:48:47	5:48:47	IY be kind of go 
295	5:49:44	5:49:46	three inch 
297	5:51:15	5:51:21	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
298	5:53:40	5:53:40	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
299	5:54:31	5:54:37	IY slope down again 
300	5:54:37	5:54:39	ok plane crash be n there 
301	5:55:29	5:55:35	and then IY you go up 
302	5:59:3	5:59:10	the slate mountain be towards the right 
305	6:1:31	6:1:37	uhm
