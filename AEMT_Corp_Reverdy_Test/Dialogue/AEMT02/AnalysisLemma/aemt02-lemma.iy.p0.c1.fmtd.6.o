start
0:0:15	0:0:22	g	maybe 
0:1:9	0:1:17	f	and then what 
0:1:26	0:1:35	g	and then 
0:3:52	0:3:55	g	like IY be slope 
0:4:4	0:4:13	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
0:4:26	0:4:32	f	ok 
0:7:49	0:7:49	f	IY go to a lake 
0:8:0	0:8:6	g	slight 
0:10:8	0:10:15	f	no IY will go with hot spring IY have 
0:10:15	0:10:18	g	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
0:12:54	0:13:2	g	IY move to the leave 
0:16:7	0:16:9	g	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
0:16:37	0:16:41	g	ok 
0:20:22	0:20:26	g	then 
0:23:10	0:23:12	g	ok 
0:23:22	0:23:29	g	uhhh no 
0:23:56	0:24:2	g	IY go straight down 
0:24:28	0:24:33	g	ok 
0:25:31	0:25:39	g	IY wanna kind of curve 
0:25:45	0:25:48	g	around the bottom of it 
0:25:50	0:25:53	g	straight up 
0:26:47	0:26:49	g	from 
0:32:46	0:32:49	g	no IY do n have any rock 
0:34:29	0:34:32	g	on sheet anyway 
0:34:47	0:34:54	g	and then IY slope up 
0:34:50	0:34:54	f	but  like five six inch from where IY be now 
0:35:14	0:35:22	g	and then 
0:38:7	0:38:13	f	and there  a collapse shelter 
0:38:9	0:38:14	g	ok 
0:39:1	0:39:9	g	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
0:44:47	0:44:54	f	yeah IY see 
0:46:3	0:46:8	f	to the leave of the antelope 
0:48:10	0:48:10	f	ok 
0:48:16	0:48:22	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
0:49:33	0:49:35	g	couple mile or something 
0:51:57	0:52:2	g	ok 
0:55:12	0:55:16	g	ok and then IY be go 
0:57:26	0:57:28	g	and slope be about an inch long 
0:58:34	0:58:42	g	ok well 
0:59:39	0:59:48	f	ok 
1:0:27	1:0:30	g	be IY in like 
1:1:42	1:1:43	f	yep 
1:2:13	1:2:17	g	what 
1:5:7	1:5:14	f	ok 
1:6:10	1:6:11	g	uhm 
1:7:43	1:7:44	g	ok IY be at the savannah 
1:9:48	1:9:56	f	oh 
1:12:23	1:12:28	f	yeah and IY go straight up 
1:12:59	1:13:2	f	ok 
1:13:28	1:13:33	g	be IY 
1:14:14	1:14:22	g	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
1:14:32	1:14:38	g	go up like three three and a half inch 
1:14:54	1:15:0	g	ok 
1:15:37	1:15:38	f	ok 
1:19:29	1:19:32	g	and then 
1:21:15	1:21:17	g	and 
1:22:39	1:22:43	g	and be to the leave 
1:24:14	1:24:15	f	do IY go around it 
1:24:56	1:24:57	f	elephant 
1:25:42	1:25:46	f	mm hmm 
1:27:9	1:27:9	g	there  a there  
1:27:40	1:27:40	f	ok 
1:28:5	1:28:7	f	ok 
1:30:4	1:30:6	g	ok 
1:31:18	1:31:22	f	IY be three inch above the savannah 
1:32:0	1:32:4	f	how many inch do IY think 
1:32:1	1:32:7	g	and IY be slope to the leave 
1:33:5	1:33:5	f	uhm 
1:33:10	1:33:16	g	three inch 
1:36:37	1:36:40	g	ok 
1:36:46	1:36:51	g	uhm 
1:36:53	1:36:56	g	an inch maybe a little bit less 
1:37:56	1:38:4	f	yeah 
1:38:52	1:38:54	g	like 
1:38:55	1:39:1	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
1:39:28	1:39:35	g	hmm 
1:40:8	1:40:14	g	no IY do n have a waterhole 
1:40:47	1:40:50	g	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
1:40:53	1:41:2	g	IY 
1:41:9	1:41:12	g	and 
1:42:57	1:43:2	f	yeah 
1:43:31	1:43:39	g	IY do n know 
1:44:27	1:44:27	g	uhm 
1:44:49	1:44:55	g	alright 
1:45:16	1:45:18	f	mm mm 
1:45:53	1:45:57	g	for like 
1:46:4	1:46:7	g	IY be just go down 
1:46:22	1:46:29	g	to right 
1:46:31	1:46:40	f	plane crash IY do n think be yeah 
1:46:50	1:46:55	f	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
1:47:41	1:47:45	g	IY be go like 
1:48:13	1:48:17	f	ok 
1:49:15	1:49:22	g	and 
1:50:0	1:50:1	g	uhm IY straighten out slope 
1:50:18	1:50:22	g	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
1:50:49	1:50:54	g	IY just kind of slope down 
1:51:36	1:51:37	g	just do it like this ok 
1:51:48	1:51:56	g	ok 
1:53:17	1:53:25	g	ok 
1:54:56	1:55:0	g	like an inch 
1:55:28	1:55:30	g	be IY anywhere near there 
1:56:43	1:56:51	g	ok 
1:57:18	1:57:20	g	three inch straight across 
1:58:9	1:58:13	g	ok 
1:58:28	1:58:32	g	a quarter of an inch 
1:58:50	1:58:58	g	no 
1:59:59	2:0:1	g	uhm 
2:0:11	2:0:20	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
2:0:52	2:0:56	f	around the top of the lake 
2:1:10	2:1:16	g	so  about IY would say 
2:6:15	2:6:16	g	it  right next to it 
2:7:40	2:7:45	g	and IY just go straight up 
2:10:15	2:10:20	g	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
2:10:53	2:11:2	f	uh IY do n know know what to say 
2:12:2	2:12:8	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
2:13:13	2:13:13	g	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
2:13:48	2:13:52	g	the slate mountain be towards the right 
2:19:29	2:19:38	g	ok 
2:19:38	2:19:43	g	ok 
2:22:43	2:22:48	g	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
2:25:4	2:25:4	f	ok 
2:25:0	2:25:5	g	the 
2:27:52	2:28:0	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
2:28:8	2:28:8	f	ok 
2:29:44	2:29:53	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
2:31:5	2:31:5	g	and IY be go 
2:33:54	2:33:58	g	maybe IY have different thing 
2:34:7	2:34:8	g	ok 
2:36:0	2:36:9	g	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
2:36:11	2:36:17	g	so IY be at the hot spring 
2:40:1	2:40:6	f	ok 
2:42:37	2:42:43	g	so 
2:42:36	2:42:45	f	ok 
2:43:45	2:43:49	g	uhm 
2:43:54	2:44:0	g	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
2:44:14	2:44:19	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
2:44:45	2:44:50	g	and then IY will come to a savannah 
2:45:13	2:45:19	g	for like 
2:45:59	2:46:2	g	to the white mountain 
2:50:18	2:50:26	g	IY be actually start like right 
2:50:43	2:50:47	f	mm hmm 
2:50:58	2:50:58	f	so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
2:51:0	2:51:8	g	like 
2:51:48	2:51:51	g	IY be at the plane crash 
2:53:19	2:53:28	g	probably the same thing 
2:54:26	2:54:27	g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
2:55:29	2:55:33	g	be IY anywere near there 
2:56:38	2:56:44	g	uhm 
2:57:32	2:57:32	f	and to the right 
2:57:54	2:58:3	g	ok well 
2:58:27	2:58:36	f	IY be start yeah the stony desert 
2:58:54	2:58:56	f	ok 
3:1:2	3:1:9	g	ok 
3:1:18	3:1:25	g	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
3:2:1	3:2:9	g	a little 
3:2:10	3:2:14	g	like four or five inch to the leave 
3:2:51	3:2:53	g	for about two inch 
3:4:22	3:4:27	g	yes 
3:4:49	3:4:51	f	nope 
3:5:21	3:5:29	g	well 
3:7:45	3:7:48	g	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
3:9:52	3:9:54	f	ok 
3:10:38	3:10:45	g	after IY slope down IY will say 
3:13:34	3:13:39	g	and then IY you go up 
3:14:28	3:14:34	g	uhm 
3:16:1	3:16:4	g	be the plane crash 
3:16:45	3:16:50	g	ok 
3:17:11	3:17:18	f	IY hit some round rock 
3:19:22	3:19:28	g	yes IY be go towards the lake 
3:20:25	3:20:32	g	and then IY be 
3:21:40	3:21:47	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
3:22:3	3:22:9	g	uhm 
3:24:8	3:24:14	f	ok wait hold on 
3:25:17	3:25:24	f	and 
3:26:27	3:26:35	g	after IY go straight again 
3:26:44	3:26:52	g	ok 
3:28:20	3:28:29	f	IY have to back up a little bit 
3:28:27	3:28:30	g	ok 
3:30:34	3:30:39	g	ok 
3:31:38	3:31:46	g	about like 
3:32:22	3:32:25	g	so anyway 
3:33:28	3:33:28	f	yeah 
3:33:35	3:33:39	g	uh like 
3:34:15	3:34:21	g	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
3:35:26	3:35:31	f	it  not like in the same place IY be describe 
3:35:47	3:35:52	g	maybe like 
3:36:28	3:36:34	f	mm hmm 
3:36:39	3:36:42	g	IY have a waterhole on map 
3:38:13	3:38:17	f	yeah 
3:40:26	3:40:32	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
3:40:42	3:40:47	g	like maybe an inch 
3:43:35	3:43:39	g	uhm 
3:44:33	3:44:40	f	IY be at the savannah 
3:45:2	3:45:10	g	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
3:45:16	3:45:16	g	maybe like 
3:45:40	3:45:48	g	do IY have roman bath 
3:46:24	3:46:26	g	ok 
3:47:28	3:47:28	g	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
3:49:21	3:49:21	f	ok 
3:49:27	3:49:31	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
3:50:31	3:50:34	f	ok 
3:50:51	3:50:55	f	ok 
3:53:26	3:53:34	f	ok 
3:54:5	3:54:10	g	like 
3:55:52	3:55:59	g	uhm 
3:56:23	3:56:29	g	like 
3:56:43	3:56:45	g	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
3:57:37	3:57:40	g	ok 
3:58:57	3:59:5	f	ok 
3:59:12	3:59:17	g	no IY have 
3:59:24	3:59:28	g	IY be go about 
4:1:30	4:1:35	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
4:2:24	4:2:25	f	mm hmm 
4:4:46	4:4:50	f	to 
4:5:7	4:5:10	f	ok 
4:5:20	4:5:27	g	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
4:6:49	4:6:56	f	so wait 
4:7:11	4:7:15	f	to the leave 
4:7:39	4:7:39	g	and there  a plane crash 
4:7:46	4:7:55	g	yes 
4:8:45	4:8:47	g	alright well IY will keep go and see 
4:9:0	4:9:1	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
4:12:58	4:13:2	g	IY get 
4:13:49	4:13:57	g	well 
4:14:28	4:14:28	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
4:14:49	4:14:52	g	ok 
4:15:38	4:15:45	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
4:15:57	4:15:58	g	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
4:16:51	4:16:52	g	IY slope down again 
4:17:0	4:17:0	g	after the circle 
4:17:30	4:17:36	g	well just 
4:17:35	4:17:39	f	up tp the right 
4:18:52	4:18:57	g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
4:19:33	4:19:39	g	be IY in like almost the top of the 
4:19:42	4:19:47	f	ok 
4:20:1	4:20:2	g	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
4:20:26	4:20:31	f	ok 
4:21:7	4:21:8	g	uhm 
4:21:11	4:21:18	g	five 
4:22:37	4:22:41	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
4:23:31	4:23:35	g	to the lake 
4:24:52	4:24:55	g	but 
4:25:40	4:25:49	g	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
4:27:54	4:27:59	g	like three inch 
4:28:0	4:28:0	g	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
4:28:58	4:29:4	g	IY would say 
4:29:22	4:29:29	f	around the lake to the top 
4:29:59	4:30:5	f	yeah 
4:33:5	4:33:11	f	IY know IY have different thing so 
4:37:38	4:37:45	g	ok 
4:37:51	4:37:55	g	ok 
4:41:0	4:41:9	g	IY be start 
4:43:33	4:43:37	g	it  not a big curve 
4:44:5	4:44:7	g	uhm 
4:44:15	4:44:17	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
4:44:34	4:44:36	g	and IY be go up like 
4:47:39	4:47:45	f	yeah 
4:47:52	4:47:55	g	alright alright well just 
4:48:20	4:48:24	g	 little slope 
4:54:12	4:54:14	f	mm hmm 
4:55:21	4:55:23	g	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
4:55:43	4:55:50	g	maybe four inch on the paper 
4:55:49	4:55:51	g	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
4:57:14	4:57:17	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
4:57:33	4:57:33	f	to the right 
4:57:32	4:57:37	g	just a slight slope 
4:59:28	4:59:30	g	so IY make circle 
5:1:45	5:1:51	g	and then 
5:2:40	5:2:43	g	IY make 
5:4:26	5:4:32	g	and then 
5:7:34	5:7:39	g	and then IY slope down to the leave 
5:8:14	5:8:22	g	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
5:10:43	5:10:50	g	to the leave 
5:11:9	5:11:14	g	and then IY go straight 
5:11:43	5:11:47	g	IY be kind of go 
5:13:40	5:13:48	g	and then 
5:14:13	5:14:17	g	alright be IY start near the 
5:16:26	5:16:27	g	to the leave 
5:17:29	5:17:33	f	mm hmm 
5:17:29	5:17:36	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
5:18:46	5:18:54	g	 about five or six inch 
5:19:6	5:19:12	g	uhm 
5:19:24	5:19:31	g	plane crash 
5:23:19	5:23:28	g	have a s 
5:23:33	5:23:40	g	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
5:29:36	5:29:37	f	IY hit some rock though 
5:30:0	5:30:2	g	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
5:32:54	5:32:57	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
5:35:11	5:35:17	g	to the leave 
5:36:17	5:36:17	f	IY have a plane crash though 
5:39:30	5:39:32	g	kind of across from stony desert 
5:39:45	5:39:48	f	yeah 
5:39:53	5:39:59	g	not right at the stony desert 
5:40:31	5:40:34	g	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
5:41:59	5:42:7	g	no 
5:42:12	5:42:14	g	so IY go three inch straight 
5:44:40	5:44:48	g	to the right 
5:45:13	5:45:22	g	they be there 
5:46:6	5:46:11	g	away about like four inch four or five inch 
5:49:9	5:49:17	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
5:49:28	5:49:32	g	after plane crash 
5:50:27	5:50:27	g	four or five inch to the leave 
5:50:41	5:50:42	g	IY be slope 
5:51:20	5:51:20	g	and then IY be go down 
5:54:34	5:54:38	g	alright 
5:55:54	5:56:1	g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all
