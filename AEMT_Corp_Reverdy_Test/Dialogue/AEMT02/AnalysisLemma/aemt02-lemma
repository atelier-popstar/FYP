f	ok 
g	ok 
g	you be start 
g	uhm and there be a stony desert 
g	you be actually start like right 
g	uhm 
g	kind of across from stony desert 
g	and 
g	you be kind of go 
g	you be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then you kind of slope down 
g	and you be go 
g	I would say 
g	maybe 
g	couple mile or something 
g	from 
g	uhm 
g	where you be go down to a plane crash 
g	uhm 
g	there  a there  
f	ok wait hold on 
g	ok 
f	you have to back up a little bit 
g	ok 
g	so you be start and there  a stony desert right across from where you start 
f	ok 
g	and you go to the leave a little bit 
g	and then 
g	uhm 
g	you just kind of slope down 
g	a little bit too 
g	and you be slope down and then you stop and you go straight 
g	after you slope down I will say 
g	like 
g	maybe like 
g	couple inch you be slope down 
g	and then you go straight 
g	for like 
g	like 
g	five 
g	maybe four inch on the paper 
g	and there  a plane crash 
f	uhm 
f	uh I do n know know what to say 
f	plane crash I do n think be yeah 
f	it  not like in the same place you be describe 
g	plane crash 
f	mm mm 
g	uhm 
g	alright be you start near the 
f	I be start yeah the stony desert 
g	be you 
g	you be start at the stony desert 
f	yeah 
g	ok and you have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
f	and 
g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where you start 
g	not right at the stony desert 
f	yeah 
g	ok and then you be go 
f	ok 
g	to the leave 
g	like an inch 
g	and then you be go down 
g	like maybe an inch 
g	 little slope 
f	ok 
g	and then you go 
g	like four or five inch to the leave 
g	and  where the plane crash be 
g	be you anywhere near there 
f	plane crash be on the other side but I will just ok 
f	so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
g	four or five inch to the leave 
f	ok 
g	and then 
g	after plane crash 
f	be I suppose to start at the same place 
f	ok 
g	ok plane crash be n there 
g	uhm 
g	alright well we will keep go and see 
g	alright 
g	so 
g	uhm 
g	you be at the plane crash 
g	and 
g	you wanna kind of curve 
g	a little 
g	to the leave 
g	and then you you go up 
g	and you be go up like 
g	three inch 
f	mm hmm 
g	and 
g	in those three inch you be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
g	it  not a big curve 
f	ok 
g	ok 
g	and then 
g	uhm 
g	after you go straight again 
g	away about like four inch four or five inch 
g	and you come to a collapse shelter 
g	be you anywere near there 
f	yeah I see 
g	ok 
f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
g	yes 
f	and there  a collapse shelter 
g	yes 
f	ok 
g	ok 
g	now you be at the collapse shelter 
g	and you go down you slope to the right 
g	just a slight slope 
g	about like 
g	an inch maybe a little bit less 
f	to the right 
g	to the right 
g	you be slope 
f	ok 
f	and then what 
g	ok 
g	and then 
g	you 
g	have a s 
g	you go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
g	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
f	mm hmm 
g	slight 
g	uhm 
g	and then you will come to a savannah 
f	ok 
g	ok 
f	so I pass a waterhole or no 
g	uhhh no 
g	no you do n have a waterhole 
g	you have a waterhole on map 
f	yeah 
g	well 
g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be you near a savannah at all 
f	yeah 
g	ok 
f	I be at the savannah 
g	ok you be at the savannah 
g	now you be curve to the rigt and then you go like a straight up about 
g	like 
g	three inch 
f	ok 
g	and you be go straight up 
g	and then you be curve to the leave around slate mountain do you have a slate mountain 
f	nope I have a white mountain 
g	ok well 
g	probably the same thing 
f	but  like five six inch from where I be now 
f	to the leave 
g	where be you right now start at the savannah 
f	yeah and I go straight up 
g	straight up 
f	and then I have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
g	hmm 
g	well 
g	I do n know 
g	alright 
g	well just 
f	be I suppose to hit every spot on the map 
g	oh you know what the white oh the white mountain no you be way up there you should n be over there 
g	the slate mountain be towards the right 
g	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
g	be you in like 
g	be you in like almost the top of the 
f	I be three inch above the savannah 
g	no you have 
g	maybe you have different thing 
g	well alright 
f	I know we have different thing so 
g	alright alright well just 
g	just do it like this ok 
g	go up like three three and a half inch 
f	and curve down to the leave 
g	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
g	it  right next to it 
g	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
f	how many inch do you think 
g	maybe like 
g	a quarter of an inch 
g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
f	oh 
f	ok 
g	ok 
g	and then so you be curve to the leave and you go straight 
g	for like 
g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
f	yeah 
g	and then you slope down to the leave 
g	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
f	mm hmm 
g	ok 
g	and then 
g	as you be slope down you will come to hot well do you have hot well 
f	no we will go with hot spring I have 
g	ok 
g	so you be at the hot spring 
g	and you be slope to the leave 
g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as you be go by the hot well 
f	mm hmm 
g	ok 
g	and then 
g	uhm 
g	you slope down again 
f	elephant 
g	uhm 
g	no there  no elephant 
g	on sheet anyway 
f	ok 
f	do I hit anything when I go down 
g	no 
g	you be just go down 
g	like you be slope 
g	and slope be about an inch long 
g	and be to the leave 
f	ok 
g	ok 
g	and then 
g	uhm 
g	you finish out slope and you go about an inch straight 
g	to the leave 
f	ok 
g	ok 
g	and then after inch you gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
f	to 
g	to the white mountain 
f	ok 
g	ok 
g	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
g	but it  like a slight slope to the right as you be go up but it  steep 
f	ok 
g	ok 
g	so  about I would say 
g	 about five or six inch 
f	mm hmm 
g	ok and then as you be pass the white mountain 
f	mm hmm 
g	uhm you straighten out slope 
g	and you just go straight up 
g	for about two inch 
g	ok 
f	yep 
g	then 
f	I hit some round rock 
g	no I do n have any rock 
f	ok 
g	ok 
f	I hit some rock though 
g	ok 
g	uhm 
g	and then you be up straight and you have go the two inch 
g	and then you slope 
g	well you do n really slope you just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
f	I go to a lake 
g	yes you be go towards the lake 
f	ok 
g	but 
g	you be go about 
g	three inch straight across 
g	to the lake 
g	and then you be 
g	you get 
f	do I go through anything 
g	uhm 
g	no 
g	you be not through anything yet you be go actually around the lake 
g	so you go three inch straight 
g	and then you slope up 
g	and you go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
f	around the lake to the top 
g	the 
g	what 
f	around the top of the lake 
g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and you kinda make like a circle 
f	ok 
g	ok 
g	and then 
g	uhm 
g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
g	do you have roman bath 
f	nope 
g	ok well 
g	they be there 
g	so anyway 
g	you make 
f	I have a plane crash though 
g	what 
f	I have plane crash we be talk about earlier  up there 
g	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
g	so you make circle 
f	ok 
f	yeah 
g	and 
g	after the circle 
g	uhm 
g	you move to the leave 
g	so you bring the circle in like a couple inch 
f	ok 
g	and you do the curve again and you just go straight down 
g	like three inch 
g	and there do you have any like antelope or anything 
f	yeah 
g	ok 
g	you go straight down 
g	uh like 
g	a little past the antelope not much just so you go around it 
f	so wait 
f	do I go by the plane crash 
g	uhm 
f	do I go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
g	no the you go to the leave of the antelope 
f	to the leave of the antelope 
g	be the plane crash 
g	like 
g	to right 
f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
f	up tp the right 
g	yes yeah you just do n even go near there 
f	ok 
g	you be go like 
f	so I go to the leave of the antelope 
g	you go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
g	and you should have a straight line there 
f	ok 
f	ok 
g	ok 
g	and then right around the antelope you take a right 
f	do I go around it 
g	around the bottom of it 
f	ok 
g	ok 
f	and to the right 
g	and then to the right and then you go like two inch and  the finish 
f	ok 
g	ok
