0:7:52	0:7:53	f	mm mm 
0:8:31	0:8:35	g	uhm 
0:11:56	0:12:4	g	 little slope 
0:12:31	0:12:35	f	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
0:14:55	0:15:2	g	well just 
0:15:24	0:15:31	g	uh like 
0:15:40	0:15:42	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
0:18:18	0:18:23	g	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
0:21:38	0:21:46	g	uhm 
0:22:36	0:22:36	g	probably the same thing 
0:24:32	0:24:39	g	about like 
0:24:54	0:24:57	f	yeah 
0:25:56	0:25:58	g	they be there 
0:26:59	0:27:5	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
0:27:3	0:27:8	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
0:28:52	0:28:56	g	ok IY be at the savannah 
0:29:10	0:29:19	g	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
0:32:35	0:32:38	g	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
0:34:35	0:34:41	g	like an inch 
0:34:54	0:34:59	g	ok 
0:39:12	0:39:13	g	ok 
0:39:13	0:39:16	f	plane crash IY do n think be yeah 
0:41:5	0:41:9	g	and then IY go 
0:45:26	0:45:34	g	maybe 
0:47:37	0:47:46	g	after the circle 
0:49:23	0:49:27	g	and then 
0:51:5	0:51:12	g	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
0:52:27	0:52:34	f	yeah IY see 
0:53:49	0:53:56	f	ok 
0:55:29	0:55:29	f	and there  a collapse shelter 
0:56:44	0:56:47	g	ok well 
0:57:10	0:57:12	g	for about two inch 
0:57:22	0:57:23	f	IY go to a lake 
0:58:0	0:58:0	g	uhm 
0:59:29	0:59:32	g	five 
1:2:23	1:2:29	g	alright 
1:2:37	1:2:37	f	ok 
1:6:6	1:6:7	g	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
1:6:40	1:6:48	g	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
1:7:34	1:7:34	g	uhm and there be a stony desert 
1:9:43	1:9:51	f	around the top of the lake 
1:9:52	1:10:0	g	ok 
1:10:28	1:10:33	g	and IY be slope to the leave 
1:11:39	1:11:41	g	after plane crash 
1:12:2	1:12:10	g	no IY do n have any rock 
1:12:34	1:12:38	g	ok 
1:14:2	1:14:4	f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
1:13:57	1:14:5	g	alright well IY will keep go and see 
1:14:12	1:14:17	g	and be to the leave 
1:14:38	1:14:38	g	and 
1:14:44	1:14:51	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
1:19:20	1:19:20	g	uhm 
1:21:19	1:21:21	g	uhm 
1:22:14	1:22:21	g	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
1:22:25	1:22:30	g	an inch maybe a little bit less 
1:23:23	1:23:24	g	just a slight slope 
1:24:29	1:24:31	g	IY 
1:25:38	1:25:44	g	ok 
1:25:54	1:26:0	g	uhm 
1:28:33	1:28:33	g	ok 
1:28:32	1:28:40	g	after IY slope down IY will say 
1:29:27	1:29:30	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
1:29:57	1:29:58	g	like IY be slope 
1:30:47	1:30:48	g	like 
1:34:40	1:34:47	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
1:34:56	1:35:2	g	and IY be go up like 
1:35:28	1:35:31	g	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
1:35:31	1:35:31	g	and then IY will come to a savannah 
1:35:37	1:35:38	f	yeah 
1:37:13	1:37:14	g	be IY anywhere near there 
1:37:19	1:37:26	f	ok 
1:37:29	1:37:33	g	ok 
1:37:48	1:37:55	f	ok 
1:38:6	1:38:7	g	and then IY slope 
1:39:15	1:39:16	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
1:40:26	1:40:33	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
1:41:6	1:41:13	f	ok 
1:41:45	1:41:46	g	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
1:43:14	1:43:17	g	no 
1:44:56	1:45:1	f	ok 
1:45:30	1:45:31	g	and IY be go

1:46:40	1:46:42	g	there  a there  
1:47:53	1:47:59	g	so IY make circle 
1:50:26	1:50:35	f	ok 
1:50:35	1:50:41	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
1:50:58	1:51:0	g	for like 
1:51:28	1:51:35	g	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
1:53:29	1:53:35	g	uhm 
1:53:29	1:53:36	g	plane crash 
1:55:3	1:55:9	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
1:55:25	1:55:33	g	alright 
1:57:0	1:57:0	g	go up like three three and a half inch 
1:59:18	1:59:27	g	uhm 
2:0:7	2:0:14	g	uhm 
2:3:56	2:3:57	g	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
2:5:7	2:5:13	g	uhhh no

2:5:19	2:5:26	g	ok 
2:5:32	2:5:33	f	ok 
2:5:53	2:5:55	g	uhm 
2:5:56	2:6:4	g	IY wanna kind of curve 
2:6:52	2:6:59	f	ok 
2:7:12	2:7:16	g	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
2:8:56	2:9:3	g	IY be go about 
2:14:57	2:14:58	g	be IY in like 
2:15:38	2:15:45	g	ok

2:30:9	2:30:10	g	alright be IY start near the 
2:32:33	2:32:33	g	IY be start at the stony desert 
2:33:8	2:33:17	g	to the right 
2:35:24	2:35:33	g	and 
2:37:49	2:37:56	g	and there  a plane crash 
2:38:42	2:38:44	g	couple inch IY be slope down 
2:38:40	2:38:49	g	IY move to the leave 
2:39:33	2:39:37	g	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
2:39:56	2:40:5	g	ok 
2:41:55	2:42:1	g	three inch 
2:42:25	2:42:29	g	it  not a big curve

2:48:5	2:48:7	g	and then 
2:48:43	2:48:47	g	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
2:49:7	2:49:14	g	do IY have roman bath 
2:52:5	2:52:7	g	then 
2:52:33	2:52:36	g	to the lake 
2:53:47	2:53:48	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
2:59:10	2:59:10	g	the 
2:59:14	2:59:19	g	and then 
3:1:40	3:1:48	g	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
3:2:50	3:2:56	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
3:8:29	3:8:35	g	maybe IY have different thing 
3:10:8	3:10:15	g	and then IY slope up 
3:10:35	3:10:38	g	ok well 
3:11:24	3:11:25	g	be IY 
3:12:28	3:12:33	f	IY be start yeah the stony desert 
3:12:30	3:12:38	g	have a s 
3:12:45	3:12:48	g	a little 
3:13:6	3:13:13	f	do IY go around it 
3:13:8	3:13:14	f	mm hmm 
3:13:11	3:13:17	f	to the leave 
3:13:15	3:13:21	g	and IY just go straight up 
3:13:17	3:13:23	g	not right at the stony desert 
3:13:27	3:13:28	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
3:13:53	3:13:57	g	so  about IY would say 
3:14:51	3:14:52	f	yeah 
3:17:39	3:17:43	f	IY have to back up a little bit 
3:18:14	3:18:23	g	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
3:19:31	3:19:39	f	ok 
3:23:6	3:23:10	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
3:23:16	3:23:16	g	and 
3:23:58	3:24:1	g	just do it like this ok 
3:25:39	3:25:45	g	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there

3:32:48	3:32:53	g	to right 
3:33:11	3:33:13	f	IY have plane crash IY be talk about earlier  up there 
3:33:24	3:33:28	g	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
3:34:27	3:34:29	g	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
3:36:33	3:36:39	g	hmm 
3:38:35	3:38:39	f	nope 
3:39:0	3:39:8	f	and 
3:40:36	3:40:41	g	and slope be about an inch long 
3:40:46	3:40:52	g	to the leave 
3:44:25	3:44:26	f	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
3:45:50	3:45:51	g	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
3:47:18	3:47:20	g	like three inch 
3:47:20	3:47:20	g	uhm 
3:47:20	3:47:20	g	and  where the plane crash be 
3:48:0	3:48:3	f	mm hmm 
3:48:6	3:48:6	f	no IY will go with hot spring IY have 
3:48:0	3:48:9	f	ok 
3:48:55	3:49:0	g	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
3:50:36	3:50:37	f	ok 
3:51:3	3:51:5	f	around the lake to the top 
3:51:27	3:51:27	g	no there  no elephant 
3:52:21	3:52:21	g	yes 
3:53:31	3:53:36	f	IY know IY have different thing so 
3:59:0	3:59:9	g	and then 
4:0:31	4:0:33	f	IY be three inch above the savannah 
4:4:12	4:4:19	g	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
4:4:43	4:4:49	g	but 
4:5:51	4:5:52	g	yes IY be go towards the lake 
4:6:57	4:7:2	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
4:7:18	4:7:24	g	uhm 
4:8:49	4:8:50	g	ok 
4:10:33	4:10:39	g	what 
4:10:48	4:10:55	g	IY be at the plane crash 
4:11:43	4:11:45	f	ok 
4:12:11	4:12:16	f	ok 
4:14:3	4:14:8	g	maybe like 
4:14:25	4:14:31	f	IY hit some rock though

4:16:38	4:16:47	g	uhm 
4:17:14	4:17:17	g	and then IY slope down to the leave 
4:18:21	4:18:27	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
4:19:51	4:19:58	g	ok 
4:20:6	4:20:15	f	yeah and IY go straight up 
4:20:26	4:20:28	g	ok

4:22:38	4:22:41	g	ok 
4:23:28	4:23:30	g	IY just kind of slope down 
4:24:55	4:25:1	g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
4:24:59	4:25:4	g	IY be just go down 
4:25:5	4:25:11	g	a quarter of an inch 
4:25:44	4:25:47	g	after IY go straight again 
4:28:7	4:28:13	g	to the leave 
4:29:8	4:29:8	g	kind of across from stony desert 
4:30:11	4:30:17	g	be the plane crash 
4:30:31	4:30:37	g	it  right next to it 
4:31:31	4:31:39	g	and then 
4:32:26	4:32:33	g	away about like four inch four or five inch 
4:33:30	4:33:36	g	ok 
4:33:37	4:33:38	f	ok 
4:34:22	4:34:26	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
4:35:1	4:35:4	g	IY would say 
4:35:16	4:35:19	f	ok 
4:37:47	4:37:51	f	oh 
4:38:44	4:38:50	g	and then IY be go down 
4:39:2	4:39:5	g	ok 
4:39:55	4:39:59	f	yeah 
4:41:43	4:41:50	f	mm hmm 
4:42:30	4:42:34	f	ok 
4:42:57	4:43:1	g	a little bit too 
4:43:12	4:43:20	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
4:45:5	4:45:8	g	no IY do n have a waterhole 
4:45:44	4:45:47	f	ok 
4:46:13	4:46:20	g	IY have a waterhole on map 
4:46:48	4:46:54	g	to the white mountain 
4:47:2	4:47:8	g	what 
4:47:12	4:47:15	f	up tp the right 
4:47:51	4:47:56	g	slight 
4:50:3	4:50:4	f	yeah 
4:52:15	4:52:18	f	ok 
4:52:22	4:52:23	g	ok 
4:53:36	4:53:44	g	well alright 
4:53:44	4:53:49	g	and then 
4:54:31	4:54:37	g	and then 
4:54:58	4:55:6	g	on sheet anyway 
4:58:31	4:58:31	g	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
4:58:45	4:58:52	g	ok 
4:59:3	4:59:7	f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
5:1:16	5:1:23	g	like 
5:1:32	5:1:35	g	ok 
5:3:19	5:3:27	g	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
5:4:9	5:4:16	g	to the leave 
5:5:24	5:5:29	f	IY be at the savannah 
5:7:13	5:7:16	g	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
5:10:1	5:10:3	g	and IY be go straight up 
5:10:11	5:10:18	g	ok 
5:11:15	5:11:22	f	so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
5:11:43	5:11:43	g	like maybe an inch 
5:12:51	5:12:54	g	IY go straight down 
5:15:7	5:15:15	g	uhm IY straighten out slope 
5:16:51	5:16:59	f	yeah 
5:18:1	5:18:6	f	ok 
5:18:49	5:18:51	g	so anyway 
5:19:50	5:19:50	g	uhm 
5:20:53	5:20:54	g	well 
5:22:55	5:23:0	g	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
5:23:57	5:24:6	g	straight up 
5:26:51	5:26:57	g	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
5:29:28	5:29:33	f	elephant 
5:29:59	5:30:3	f	and then what 
5:30:4	5:30:9	g	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
5:30:9	5:30:14	g	IY be actually start like right 
5:32:44	5:32:47	g	from 
5:33:22	5:33:25	f	mm hmm 
5:33:58	5:34:4	g	so IY be at the hot spring 
5:34:44	5:34:48	g	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
5:36:14	5:36:21	g	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
5:36:44	5:36:46	g	and then 
5:38:4	5:38:12	f	and to the right 
5:39:3	5:39:8	f	how many inch do IY think 
5:41:55	5:41:57	g	ok 
5:44:49	5:44:52	g	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
5:45:53	5:45:56	f	uhm 
5:45:53	5:45:59	f	ok 
5:47:1	5:47:8	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
5:47:19	5:47:22	g	and 
5:48:4	5:48:6	g	couple mile or something 
5:48:47	5:48:47	g	IY be kind of go 
5:49:44	5:49:46	g	three inch 
5:50:48	5:50:53	f	ok 
5:51:15	5:51:21	g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
5:53:40	5:53:40	g	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
5:54:31	5:54:37	g	IY slope down again 
5:54:37	5:54:39	g	ok plane crash be n there 
5:55:29	5:55:35	g	and then IY you go up 
5:59:3	5:59:10	g	the slate mountain be towards the right 
6:0:12	6:0:20	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
