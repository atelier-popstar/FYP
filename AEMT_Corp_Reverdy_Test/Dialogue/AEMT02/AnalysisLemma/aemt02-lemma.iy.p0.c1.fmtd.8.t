start
start g
0	0:0:40	0:0:48	plane crash 
4	0:5:49	0:5:51	and IY be go up like 
5	0:6:46	0:6:55	uhm 
7	0:8:42	0:8:49	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
8	0:10:21	0:10:26	IY slope down again 
9	0:12:54	0:12:54	like an inch 
10	0:13:38	0:13:40	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
16	0:21:20	0:21:24	alright 
17	0:21:28	0:21:34	IY be go about 
18	0:22:25	0:22:33	and IY be go 
19	0:24:43	0:24:44	well 
21	0:25:44	0:25:50	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
22	0:26:8	0:26:15	ok 
23	0:28:0	0:28:2	ok 
24	0:29:10	0:29:19	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
26	0:38:2	0:38:10	like IY be slope 
27	0:39:27	0:39:27	ok 
28	0:40:12	0:40:19	ok 
30	0:42:6	0:42:15	but 
31	0:44:5	0:44:6	maybe IY have different thing 
32	0:44:15	0:44:23	then 
33	0:44:46	0:44:48	and 
34	0:46:12	0:46:21	like 
35	0:46:59	0:47:6	so IY go three inch straight 
36	0:47:28	0:47:31	no IY do n have a waterhole 
37	0:47:57	0:48:0	and then 
39	0:48:56	0:48:58	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
41	0:49:19	0:49:20	like four or five inch to the leave 
42	0:51:5	0:51:8	IY be actually start like right 
45	0:59:10	0:59:12	probably the same thing 
46	0:59:25	0:59:32	uhm 
47	0:59:32	0:59:39	four or five inch to the leave 
48	1:0:31	1:0:33	five 
50	1:3:2	1:3:7	IY be start at the stony desert 
51	1:3:54	1:4:2	be IY in like almost the top of the 
52	1:4:40	1:4:41	ok IY be at the savannah 
53	1:4:37	1:4:45	uhm 
54	1:5:43	1:5:50	ok 
55	1:8:2	1:8:9	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
60	1:9:45	1:9:51	maybe 
61	1:12:31	1:12:40	no IY have 
63	1:13:43	1:13:44	a quarter of an inch 
65	1:14:15	1:14:17	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
66	1:15:9	1:15:18	be IY 
67	1:16:4	1:16:12	uhm 
68	1:17:45	1:17:51	be IY anywhere near there 
70	1:20:26	1:20:32	ok well 
72	1:23:29	1:23:34	couple mile or something 
73	1:23:56	1:24:1	after IY go straight again 
74	1:26:25	1:26:26	just do it like this ok 
75	1:27:7	1:27:14	alright 
76	1:27:49	1:27:55	and IY should have a straight line there 
77	1:30:14	1:30:18	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
78	1:30:45	1:30:49	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
79	1:31:11	1:31:15	and then 
80	1:35:43	1:35:43	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
81	1:40:47	1:40:51	on sheet anyway 
82	1:44:0	1:44:9	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
83	1:44:11	1:44:13	for like 
84	1:44:35	1:44:39	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
86	1:47:59	1:48:4	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
87	1:49:41	1:49:44	uhm and there be a stony desert 
88	1:52:17	1:52:18	so  about IY would say 
89	1:53:11	1:53:17	uhm 
91	1:53:49	1:53:53	to the leave of little path where path should be 
93	1:55:10	1:55:13	ok 
94	1:55:30	1:55:32	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
95	1:56:0	1:56:2	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
96	1:57:43	1:57:46	straight up 
98	2:2:42	2:2:49	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
99	2:3:30	2:3:39	ok 
100	2:3:38	2:3:41	alright be IY start near the 
101	2:4:34	2:4:35	ok 
103	2:7:7	2:7:15	ok 
104	2:8:22	2:8:31	from 
105	2:9:14	2:9:16	to the leave 
106	2:9:37	2:9:45	and then 
107	2:9:51	2:9:54	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
111	2:18:21	2:18:21	to right 
112	2:18:29	2:18:33	ok 
115	2:19:13	2:19:20	just a slight slope 
116	2:22:51	2:22:57	kind of across from stony desert 
119	2:26:6	2:26:12	and then IY will come to a savannah 
121	2:26:47	2:26:50	no there  no elephant 
122	2:27:47	2:27:50	to the lake 
123	2:27:46	2:27:50	and then 
124	2:29:27	2:29:35	well alright 
125	2:29:55	2:30:3	uhm 
127	2:33:42	2:33:50	and then 
129	2:34:47	2:34:55	so IY be at the hot spring 
131	2:39:0	2:39:9	to the leave 
132	2:41:34	2:41:38	right next to circle should be roman bath 
136	2:48:10	2:48:10	ok 
137	2:48:10	2:48:14	after plane crash 
138	2:49:17	2:49:20	and then IY slope down to the leave 
139	2:49:49	2:49:58	uhm 
140	2:52:0	2:52:3	ok 
141	2:53:40	2:53:49	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
142	2:54:5	2:54:13	and IY be slope to the leave 
147	2:58:9	2:58:18	uhm 
148	3:0:19	3:0:23	IY have a waterhole on map 
149	3:1:43	3:1:48	yes IY be go towards the lake 
150	3:5:16	3:5:23	go up like three three and a half inch 
151	3:7:3	3:7:11	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
153	3:9:2	3:9:6	they be there 
154	3:9:40	3:9:40	and 
156	3:11:57	3:11:58	IY be kind of go 
158	3:15:23	3:15:26	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
160	3:15:38	3:15:38	it  right next to it 
162	3:17:27	3:17:36	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
163	3:18:9	3:18:16	ok 
164	3:18:16	3:18:24	and then IY be go down 
167	3:23:14	3:23:19	and it slope a little bit to the right 
168	3:24:26	3:24:30	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
169	3:24:50	3:24:55	and IY just go straight up 
170	3:24:57	3:25:2	ok and then IY be go 
171	3:25:29	3:25:36	IY go straight down 
173	3:27:43	3:27:47	slight 
174	3:28:23	3:28:30	ok 
175	3:28:33	3:28:40	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
176	3:30:42	3:30:44	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
178	3:33:2	3:33:7	yes 
179	3:34:40	3:34:46	ok 
180	3:35:12	3:35:14	IY would say 
182	3:37:39	3:37:45	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
183	3:37:49	3:37:54	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
184	3:38:57	3:39:5	uhm 
185	3:39:22	3:39:30	be the plane crash 
187	3:41:4	3:41:10	alright alright well just 
188	3:42:36	3:42:45	there  a there  
189	3:42:41	3:42:50	no 
190	3:45:32	3:45:32	be IY anywere near there 
191	3:46:42	3:46:48	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
192	3:46:51	3:46:51	IY be just go down 
193	3:47:3	3:47:12	ok 
194	3:47:26	3:47:28	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
195	3:48:56	3:48:56	no 
196	3:49:55	3:50:2	do IY have roman bath 
198	3:50:25	3:50:29	IY be at the plane crash 
199	3:51:23	3:51:29	well just 
201	3:53:44	3:53:52	 little slope 
202	3:54:6	3:54:14	like 
203	3:54:45	3:54:45	uhm IY straighten out slope 
204	3:55:1	3:55:2	and then 
206	3:58:40	3:58:48	 about five or six inch 
207	3:59:50	3:59:59	uhm 
208	4:0:57	4:1:2	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
209	4:2:55	4:2:58	three inch straight across 
210	4:3:2	4:3:2	three inch 
211	4:3:39	4:3:42	uhm 
212	4:4:5	4:4:7	ok 
215	4:7:8	4:7:12	to the right 
216	4:7:18	4:7:26	ok 
217	4:7:48	4:7:57	what 
218	4:8:40	4:8:40	have a s 
220	4:12:51	4:13:0	uhm 
221	4:13:32	4:13:33	and 
222	4:14:9	4:14:15	couple inch IY be slope down 
223	4:15:1	4:15:5	well 
224	4:15:19	4:15:22	so anyway 
225	4:15:54	4:15:57	so IY make circle 
226	4:18:27	4:18:28	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
227	4:19:12	4:19:19	maybe like 
230	4:21:21	4:21:27	ok 
231	4:21:31	4:21:33	maybe like 
232	4:21:40	4:21:43	away about like four inch four or five inch 
233	4:21:51	4:21:52	like maybe an inch 
234	4:22:8	4:22:9	after the circle 
235	4:23:47	4:23:53	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
236	4:26:20	4:26:26	a little 
237	4:28:50	4:28:56	a little bit too 
238	4:28:59	4:29:6	IY just kind of slope down 
239	4:29:8	4:29:17	ok 
241	4:31:27	4:31:29	and then IY go straight 
242	4:31:45	4:31:46	maybe four inch on the paper 
245	4:33:0	4:33:0	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
249	4:36:47	4:36:56	and then IY slope 
251	4:38:3	4:38:7	to the white mountain 
252	4:40:2	4:40:11	and then IY go 
253	4:43:53	4:43:56	for about two inch 
254	4:45:17	4:45:21	the 
255	4:45:21	4:45:24	for like 
256	4:50:13	4:50:16	uhm 
258	4:51:32	4:51:35	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
259	4:51:53	4:52:0	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
260	4:54:6	4:54:15	and there  a plane crash 
261	4:55:13	4:55:21	no IY do n have any rock 
263	4:55:35	4:55:36	uhm 
265	4:59:50	4:59:59	be IY in like 
266	5:1:49	5:1:58	IY get 
267	5:2:25	5:2:25	and then IY be 
268	5:3:2	5:3:9	about like 
269	5:3:50	5:3:54	IY be slope 
271	5:5:29	5:5:35	alright well IY will keep go and see 
272	5:5:52	5:5:57	and slope be about an inch long 
274	5:6:29	5:6:33	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
275	5:6:42	5:6:51	it  not a big curve 
277	5:10:23	5:10:28	what 
278	5:10:43	5:10:47	ok well 
279	5:13:50	5:13:58	an inch maybe a little bit less 
280	5:14:48	5:14:56	IY be go like 
281	5:15:35	5:15:42	after IY slope down IY will say 
282	5:16:16	5:16:21	ok 
283	5:16:21	5:16:23	and then 
284	5:18:22	5:18:29	not right at the stony desert 
285	5:19:59	5:20:2	yes 
286	5:21:36	5:21:40	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
287	5:21:48	5:21:55	IY move to the leave 
289	5:23:34	5:23:41	and 
290	5:23:58	5:24:3	and then IY you go up 
292	5:29:3	5:29:9	uhm 
297	5:37:38	5:37:47	ok 
298	5:37:49	5:37:54	ok plane crash be n there 
299	5:39:11	5:39:20	ok 
300	5:39:36	5:39:38	IY make 
301	5:40:45	5:40:45	and be to the leave 
303	5:42:39	5:42:40	uh like 
304	5:46:4	5:46:6	like three inch 
305	5:47:52	5:47:57	and  where the plane crash be 
306	5:49:4	5:49:7	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
307	5:49:18	5:49:18	three inch 
308	5:49:57	5:50:4	like 
309	5:50:5	5:50:5	like 
310	5:53:4	5:53:10	around the bottom of it 
311	5:56:41	5:56:42	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
312	5:56:41	5:56:50	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
313	5:58:1	5:58:9	uhm 
314	5:58:2	5:58:9	and then IY slope up 
315	5:58:25	5:58:30	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
317	6:0:10	6:0:17	the slate mountain be towards the right 
318	6:1:19	6:1:25	uhm 
321	6:7:23	6:7:24	IY be start 
322	6:7:29	6:7:31	and IY go to the leave a little bit

325	6:12:13	6:12:15	ok 
327	6:15:4	6:15:9	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
328	6:15:49	6:15:57	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
329	6:16:56	6:16:58	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
330	6:17:25	6:17:25	to the leave 
331	6:19:36	6:19:40	IY do n know 
332	6:20:34	6:20:42	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
333	6:21:30	6:21:32	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
334	6:21:30	6:21:37	IY wanna kind of curve 
335	6:22:39	6:22:42	so 
337	6:27:13	6:27:16	and IY be go straight up 
339	6:31:52	6:31:52	and then

342	6:35:46	6:35:54	hmm 
start f
1	0:1:10	0:1:11	do IY go by the plane crash 
2	0:1:49	0:1:56	ok 
3	0:5:43	0:5:44	ok 
6	0:8:35	0:8:40	ok

13	0:16:18	0:16:21	and then what 
14	0:18:30	0:18:34	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
15	0:21:18	0:21:22	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
20	0:25:7	0:25:13	elephant 
25	0:30:5	0:30:9	ok

62	1:12:51	1:12:59	ok 
64	1:14:1	1:14:5	around the top of the lake 
69	1:17:54	1:17:59	IY be three inch above the savannah

157	3:12:34	3:12:38	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
159	3:15:31	3:15:33	yep 
161	3:17:1	3:17:5	ok 
165	3:19:4	3:19:6	ok

229	4:21:0	4:21:3	and curve down to the leave 
240	4:31:18	4:31:25	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
243	4:31:43	4:31:52	yeah 
244	4:32:3	4:32:10	so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
246	4:33:24	4:33:28	IY have to back up a little bit 
247	4:33:30	4:33:36	but  like five six inch from where IY be now 
248	4:33:50	4:33:54	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
250	4:36:52	4:36:57	yeah IY see 
257	4:51:9	4:51:15	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
262	4:55:28	4:55:28	ok 
264	4:58:58	4:59:1	yeah 
270	5:5:14	5:5:20	IY have a plane crash though 
273	5:6:23	5:6:31	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
276	5:9:20	5:9:26	do IY go through anything 
288	5:22:44	5:22:46	yeah and IY go straight up 
291	5:28:6	5:28:6	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
293	5:29:42	5:29:47	how many inch do IY think 
294	5:30:1	5:30:5	mm hmm 
295	5:30:48	5:30:49	IY have plane crash IY be talk about earlier  up there 
296	5:33:23	5:33:29	ok 
302	5:42:37	5:42:39	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
316	5:59:2	5:59:11	ok 
319	6:1:45	6:1:49	ok 
320	6:6:10	6:6:19	ok

326	6:12:42	6:12:44	IY go to a lake 
336	6:24:17	6:24:23	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
338	6:28:21	6:28:23	uhm 
start g
0	0:0:40	0:0:48	plane crash 
4	0:5:49	0:5:51	and IY be go up like 
5	0:6:46	0:6:55	uhm 
7	0:8:42	0:8:49	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
8	0:10:21	0:10:26	IY slope down again 
9	0:12:54	0:12:54	like an inch 
10	0:13:38	0:13:40	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
16	0:21:20	0:21:24	alright 
17	0:21:28	0:21:34	IY be go about 
18	0:22:25	0:22:33	and IY be go 
19	0:24:43	0:24:44	well 
21	0:25:44	0:25:50	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
22	0:26:8	0:26:15	ok 
23	0:28:0	0:28:2	ok 
24	0:29:10	0:29:19	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish

34	0:46:12	0:46:21	like 
35	0:46:59	0:47:6	so IY go three inch straight 
36	0:47:28	0:47:31	no IY do n have a waterhole 
37	0:47:57	0:48:0	and then 
39	0:48:56	0:48:58	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
41	0:49:19	0:49:20	like four or five inch to the leave 
42	0:51:5	0:51:8	IY be actually start like right 
45	0:59:10	0:59:12	probably the same thing 
46	0:59:25	0:59:32	uhm 
47	0:59:32	0:59:39	four or five inch to the leave 
48	1:0:31	1:0:33	five 
50	1:3:2	1:3:7	IY be start at the stony desert 
51	1:3:54	1:4:2	be IY in like almost the top of the 
52	1:4:40	1:4:41	ok IY be at the savannah 
53	1:4:37	1:4:45	uhm 
54	1:5:43	1:5:50	ok 
55	1:8:2	1:8:9	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
60	1:9:45	1:9:51	maybe 
61	1:12:31	1:12:40	no IY have 
63	1:13:43	1:13:44	a quarter of an inch 
65	1:14:15	1:14:17	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
66	1:15:9	1:15:18	be IY 
67	1:16:4	1:16:12	uhm 
68	1:17:45	1:17:51	be IY anywhere near there 
70	1:20:26	1:20:32	ok well 
72	1:23:29	1:23:34	couple mile or something 
73	1:23:56	1:24:1	after IY go straight again 
74	1:26:25	1:26:26	just do it like this ok 
75	1:27:7	1:27:14	alright 
76	1:27:49	1:27:55	and IY should have a straight line there 
77	1:30:14	1:30:18	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
78	1:30:45	1:30:49	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
79	1:31:11	1:31:15	and then 
80	1:35:43	1:35:43	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
81	1:40:47	1:40:51	on sheet anyway 
82	1:44:0	1:44:9	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
83	1:44:11	1:44:13	for like 
84	1:44:35	1:44:39	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
86	1:47:59	1:48:4	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
87	1:49:41	1:49:44	uhm and there be a stony desert 
88	1:52:17	1:52:18	so  about IY would say 
89	1:53:11	1:53:17	uhm 
91	1:53:49	1:53:53	to the leave of little path where path should be 
93	1:55:10	1:55:13	ok 
94	1:55:30	1:55:32	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
95	1:56:0	1:56:2	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
96	1:57:43	1:57:46	straight up 
98	2:2:42	2:2:49	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
99	2:3:30	2:3:39	ok 
100	2:3:38	2:3:41	alright be IY start near the 
101	2:4:34	2:4:35	ok 
103	2:7:7	2:7:15	ok 
104	2:8:22	2:8:31	from 
105	2:9:14	2:9:16	to the leave 
106	2:9:37	2:9:45	and then 
107	2:9:51	2:9:54	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
111	2:18:21	2:18:21	to right 
112	2:18:29	2:18:33	ok 
115	2:19:13	2:19:20	just a slight slope 
116	2:22:51	2:22:57	kind of across from stony desert 
119	2:26:6	2:26:12	and then IY will come to a savannah 
121	2:26:47	2:26:50	no there  no elephant 
122	2:27:47	2:27:50	to the lake 
123	2:27:46	2:27:50	and then 
124	2:29:27	2:29:35	well alright 
125	2:29:55	2:30:3	uhm 
127	2:33:42	2:33:50	and then 
129	2:34:47	2:34:55	so IY be at the hot spring 
131	2:39:0	2:39:9	to the leave 
132	2:41:34	2:41:38	right next to circle should be roman bath 
136	2:48:10	2:48:10	ok 
137	2:48:10	2:48:14	after plane crash 
138	2:49:17	2:49:20	and then IY slope down to the leave 
139	2:49:49	2:49:58	uhm 
140	2:52:0	2:52:3	ok 
141	2:53:40	2:53:49	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
142	2:54:5	2:54:13	and IY be slope to the leave 
147	2:58:9	2:58:18	uhm 
148	3:0:19	3:0:23	IY have a waterhole on map 
149	3:1:43	3:1:48	yes IY be go towards the lake 
150	3:5:16	3:5:23	go up like three three and a half inch 
151	3:7:3	3:7:11	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
153	3:9:2	3:9:6	they be there 
154	3:9:40	3:9:40	and 
156	3:11:57	3:11:58	IY be kind of go 
158	3:15:23	3:15:26	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
160	3:15:38	3:15:38	it  right next to it 
162	3:17:27	3:17:36	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
163	3:18:9	3:18:16	ok 
164	3:18:16	3:18:24	and then IY be go down 
167	3:23:14	3:23:19	and it slope a little bit to the right 
168	3:24:26	3:24:30	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
169	3:24:50	3:24:55	and IY just go straight up 
170	3:24:57	3:25:2	ok and then IY be go 
171	3:25:29	3:25:36	IY go straight down 
173	3:27:43	3:27:47	slight 
174	3:28:23	3:28:30	ok 
175	3:28:33	3:28:40	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
176	3:30:42	3:30:44	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
178	3:33:2	3:33:7	yes 
179	3:34:40	3:34:46	ok 
180	3:35:12	3:35:14	IY would say 
182	3:37:39	3:37:45	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
183	3:37:49	3:37:54	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
184	3:38:57	3:39:5	uhm 
185	3:39:22	3:39:30	be the plane crash 
187	3:41:4	3:41:10	alright alright well just 
188	3:42:36	3:42:45	there  a there  
189	3:42:41	3:42:50	no 
190	3:45:32	3:45:32	be IY anywere near there 
191	3:46:42	3:46:48	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
192	3:46:51	3:46:51	IY be just go down 
193	3:47:3	3:47:12	ok 
194	3:47:26	3:47:28	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
195	3:48:56	3:48:56	no 
196	3:49:55	3:50:2	do IY have roman bath 
198	3:50:25	3:50:29	IY be at the plane crash 
199	3:51:23	3:51:29	well just 
201	3:53:44	3:53:52	 little slope 
202	3:54:6	3:54:14	like 
203	3:54:45	3:54:45	uhm IY straighten out slope 
204	3:55:1	3:55:2	and then 
206	3:58:40	3:58:48	 about five or six inch 
207	3:59:50	3:59:59	uhm 
208	4:0:57	4:1:2	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
209	4:2:55	4:2:58	three inch straight across 
210	4:3:2	4:3:2	three inch 
211	4:3:39	4:3:42	uhm 
212	4:4:5	4:4:7	ok 
215	4:7:8	4:7:12	to the right 
216	4:7:18	4:7:26	ok 
217	4:7:48	4:7:57	what 
218	4:8:40	4:8:40	have a s 
220	4:12:51	4:13:0	uhm 
221	4:13:32	4:13:33	and 
222	4:14:9	4:14:15	couple inch IY be slope down 
223	4:15:1	4:15:5	well 
224	4:15:19	4:15:22	so anyway 
225	4:15:54	4:15:57	so IY make circle 
226	4:18:27	4:18:28	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
227	4:19:12	4:19:19	maybe like 
230	4:21:21	4:21:27	ok 
231	4:21:31	4:21:33	maybe like 
232	4:21:40	4:21:43	away about like four inch four or five inch 
233	4:21:51	4:21:52	like maybe an inch 
234	4:22:8	4:22:9	after the circle 
235	4:23:47	4:23:53	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
236	4:26:20	4:26:26	a little 
237	4:28:50	4:28:56	a little bit too 
238	4:28:59	4:29:6	IY just kind of slope down 
239	4:29:8	4:29:17	ok 
241	4:31:27	4:31:29	and then IY go straight 
242	4:31:45	4:31:46	maybe four inch on the paper 
245	4:33:0	4:33:0	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
249	4:36:47	4:36:56	and then IY slope 
251	4:38:3	4:38:7	to the white mountain 
252	4:40:2	4:40:11	and then IY go 
253	4:43:53	4:43:56	for about two inch 
254	4:45:17	4:45:21	the 
255	4:45:21	4:45:24	for like 
256	4:50:13	4:50:16	uhm 
258	4:51:32	4:51:35	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
259	4:51:53	4:52:0	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
260	4:54:6	4:54:15	and there  a plane crash 
261	4:55:13	4:55:21	no IY do n have any rock 
263	4:55:35	4:55:36	uhm 
265	4:59:50	4:59:59	be IY in like 
266	5:1:49	5:1:58	IY get 
267	5:2:25	5:2:25	and then IY be 
268	5:3:2	5:3:9	about like 
269	5:3:50	5:3:54	IY be slope 
271	5:5:29	5:5:35	alright well IY will keep go and see 
272	5:5:52	5:5:57	and slope be about an inch long 
274	5:6:29	5:6:33	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
275	5:6:42	5:6:51	it  not a big curve 
277	5:10:23	5:10:28	what 
278	5:10:43	5:10:47	ok well 
279	5:13:50	5:13:58	an inch maybe a little bit less 
280	5:14:48	5:14:56	IY be go like 
281	5:15:35	5:15:42	after IY slope down IY will say 
282	5:16:16	5:16:21	ok 
283	5:16:21	5:16:23	and then 
284	5:18:22	5:18:29	not right at the stony desert 
285	5:19:59	5:20:2	yes 
286	5:21:36	5:21:40	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
287	5:21:48	5:21:55	IY move to the leave 
289	5:23:34	5:23:41	and 
290	5:23:58	5:24:3	and then IY you go up 
292	5:29:3	5:29:9	uhm 
297	5:37:38	5:37:47	ok 
298	5:37:49	5:37:54	ok plane crash be n there 
299	5:39:11	5:39:20	ok 
300	5:39:36	5:39:38	IY make 
301	5:40:45	5:40:45	and be to the leave 
303	5:42:39	5:42:40	uh like 
304	5:46:4	5:46:6	like three inch 
305	5:47:52	5:47:57	and  where the plane crash be 
306	5:49:4	5:49:7	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
307	5:49:18	5:49:18	three inch 
308	5:49:57	5:50:4	like 
309	5:50:5	5:50:5	like 
310	5:53:4	5:53:10	around the bottom of it 
311	5:56:41	5:56:42	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
312	5:56:41	5:56:50	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
313	5:58:1	5:58:9	uhm 
314	5:58:2	5:58:9	and then IY slope up
