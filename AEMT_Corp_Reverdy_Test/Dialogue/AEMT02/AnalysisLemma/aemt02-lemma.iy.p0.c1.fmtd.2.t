start g
2	0:2:42	0:2:43	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
3	0:4:30	0:4:33	not right at the stony desert 
4	0:6:59	0:7:1	and then 
7	0:8:48	0:8:55	they be there 
8	0:10:36	0:10:37	to the leave 
9	0:10:42	0:10:42	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
10	0:12:23	0:12:30	and be to the leave 
11	0:15:50	0:15:53	a little bit too 
12	0:17:37	0:17:45	ok and then IY be go 
13	0:19:13	0:19:18	alright well IY will keep go and see 
14	0:20:5	0:20:10	maybe four inch on the paper 
15	0:20:27	0:20:32	ok 
17	0:21:58	0:22:2	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
18	0:21:54	0:22:2	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
19	0:24:0	0:24:5	 little slope 
20	0:26:4	0:26:13	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
21	0:28:28	0:28:31	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
23	0:29:48	0:29:57	it  right next to it 
25	0:31:37	0:31:42	the slate mountain be towards the right 
26	0:31:39	0:31:42	uhhh no 
28	0:33:42	0:33:43	ok 
29	0:34:26	0:34:34	ok 
30	0:35:19	0:35:20	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
33	0:36:49	0:36:51	yes 
34	0:36:52	0:36:54	IY make 
35	0:37:15	0:37:17	uhm

40	0:41:28	0:41:33	do IY have roman bath 
42	0:43:17	0:43:26	alright 
43	0:43:30	0:43:34	so anyway 
45	0:45:57	0:46:1	uhm 
46	0:46:12	0:46:16	IY move to the leave 
49	0:49:18	0:49:24	IY have a waterhole on map 
50	0:51:28	0:51:31	ok 
52	0:53:20	0:53:28	ok 
53	0:55:58	0:56:6	to the leave of little path where path should be 
54	0:57:55	0:57:57	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
55	0:58:29	0:58:33	no IY have 
58	1:4:52	1:4:52	so IY go three inch straight 
60	1:5:53	1:5:56	ok 
62	1:6:33	1:6:37	well 
65	1:11:31	1:11:34	IY be just go down

68	1:17:20	1:17:21	uhm 
69	1:17:27	1:17:30	like 
70	1:18:1	1:18:4	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
71	1:18:35	1:18:43	just a slight slope 
72	1:19:5	1:19:14	like four or five inch to the leave 
73	1:20:56	1:21:0	to right 
76	1:25:56	1:25:59	IY be go about 
77	1:26:17	1:26:26	like an inch 
80	1:30:23	1:30:23	like 
81	1:32:54	1:32:59	no 
82	1:33:1	1:33:7	three inch straight across 
84	1:35:15	1:35:23	ok plane crash be n there 
85	1:38:1	1:38:6	IY be actually start like right 
86	1:38:7	1:38:14	no IY do n have any rock 
89	1:42:49	1:42:56	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
90	1:43:0	1:43:1	ok 
91	1:43:53	1:43:58	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
93	1:46:11	1:46:19	and slope be about an inch long 
94	1:53:44	1:53:52	about like 
95	1:58:14	1:58:22	but 
96	1:59:4	1:59:6	uhm 
97	1:59:3	1:59:7	uhm 
99	2:5:18	2:5:25	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
103	2:10:20	2:10:26	ok 
104	2:11:4	2:11:9	around the bottom of it 
105	2:12:7	2:12:9	and then IY be 
107	2:16:13	2:16:21	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
109	2:16:43	2:16:50	like 
110	2:17:19	2:17:22	a quarter of an inch 
111	2:19:2	2:19:9	uhm 
113	2:21:37	2:21:41	so IY make circle 
116	2:26:7	2:26:13	and 
118	2:26:57	2:26:58	to the right 
120	2:31:42	2:31:42	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
121	2:31:54	2:32:1	and then IY slope up 
122	2:32:9	2:32:10	yes IY be go towards the lake 
123	2:32:12	2:32:17	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
124	2:32:17	2:32:18	like three inch 
125	2:40:31	2:40:35	ok 
126	2:40:31	2:40:37	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
128	2:41:10	2:41:17	and then IY you go up 
130	2:43:24	2:43:24	like 
131	2:44:25	2:44:32	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
132	2:45:20	2:45:24	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
135	2:47:57	2:48:6	and then IY go 
136	2:48:36	2:48:41	uhm 
137	2:48:49	2:48:53	for like 
138	2:49:16	2:49:25	and 
139	2:50:3	2:50:4	well just 
140	2:51:24	2:51:26	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
141	2:51:56	2:52:1	IY would say 
142	2:51:57	2:52:6	ok 
143	2:52:45	2:52:48	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
145	2:55:9	2:55:15	alright be IY start near the 
147	3:1:43	3:1:47	like maybe an inch 
148	3:5:20	3:5:23	and IY should have a straight line there 
149	3:6:6	3:6:14	for about two inch 
152	3:10:32	3:10:39	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
153	3:10:55	3:11:0	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
154	3:11:51	3:11:55	and then 
155	3:12:0	3:12:7	and then 
156	3:13:51	3:13:58	be IY anywhere near there 
157	3:14:26	3:14:35	and 
159	3:16:40	3:16:41	after IY go straight again 
161	3:17:11	3:17:20	ok 
163	3:19:30	3:19:30	alright alright well just 
164	3:19:33	3:19:33	ok well 
165	3:20:8	3:20:9	and then 
166	3:22:59	3:23:6	to the lake 
169	3:25:42	3:25:49	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
170	3:26:28	3:26:34	be the plane crash 
171	3:27:3	3:27:9	maybe like 
173	3:28:34	3:28:38	after the circle 
176	3:29:29	3:29:35	no IY do n have a waterhole 
177	3:30:21	3:30:29	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
178	3:31:11	3:31:14	ok IY be at the savannah 
179	3:31:23	3:31:23	so 
180	3:32:0	3:32:2	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
181	3:34:20	3:34:20	an inch maybe a little bit less 
183	3:34:43	3:34:51	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
184	3:36:12	3:36:18	uhm 
185	3:36:28	3:36:30	be IY 
187	3:38:6	3:38:7	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
188	3:38:28	3:38:33	uhm 
190	3:40:2	3:40:4	be IY anywere near there 
191	3:41:55	3:42:1	alright 
192	3:42:7	3:42:14	after IY slope down IY will say 
194	3:45:0	3:45:3	uhm 
195	3:47:27	3:47:27	kind of across from stony desert 
196	3:48:58	3:49:2	IY be at the plane crash 
197	3:48:59	3:49:8	IY slope down again 
198	3:49:43	3:49:50	and IY just go straight up 
199	3:51:41	3:51:49	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
204	3:54:52	3:54:56	like IY be slope 
205	3:55:38	3:55:45	to the leave 
206	3:55:55	3:56:1	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
207	3:57:21	3:57:26	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
209	3:58:44	3:58:49	on sheet anyway 
210	3:58:51	3:58:56	uhm 
211	3:58:55	3:58:56	couple inch IY be slope down 
212	3:59:4	3:59:10	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
213	3:59:16	3:59:18	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
214	3:59:33	3:59:34	three inch 
216	4:0:40	4:0:45	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
217	4:1:5	4:1:10	no there  no elephant 
218	4:1:53	4:2:2	ok 
220	4:5:53	4:5:56	to the white mountain 
221	4:6:34	4:6:41	and then IY will come to a savannah 
223	4:7:6	4:7:15	and then 
224	4:7:27	4:7:33	and then 
225	4:9:13	4:9:20	ok 
226	4:10:17	4:10:20	and then IY go straight 
227	4:11:25	4:11:25	so IY be at the hot spring 
228	4:11:48	4:11:50	ok 
229	4:14:51	4:14:54	ok 
230	4:15:44	4:15:50	and then 
231	4:16:31	4:16:32	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
232	4:19:58	4:20:5	ok 
233	4:22:42	4:22:47	for like 
234	4:22:57	4:23:0	it  not a big curve 
236	4:26:27	4:26:29	what 
238	4:27:31	4:27:31	there  a there  
240	4:28:7	4:28:14	the

242	4:32:34	4:32:37	ok 
244	4:37:52	4:37:59	maybe IY have different thing 
245	4:39:8	4:39:16	 about five or six inch 
246	4:39:25	4:39:27	uhm 
247	4:40:58	4:41:6	ok 
249	4:44:7	4:44:15	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
251	4:45:34	4:45:40	and then IY slope down to the leave 
253	4:48:24	4:48:24	uhm 
254	4:48:44	4:48:44	have a s 
256	4:49:28	4:49:29	and then 
257	4:51:5	4:51:11	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
258	4:51:26	4:51:30	IY go straight down 
259	4:53:21	4:53:23	couple mile or something 
260	4:57:14	4:57:20	yes 
261	4:57:19	4:57:23	and  where the plane crash be 
262	4:57:21	4:57:25	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
263	4:57:52	4:57:57	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
264	4:58:30	4:58:35	probably the same thing 
265	4:59:10	4:59:12	hmm 
266	5:0:23	5:0:25	IY be slope 
267	5:2:34	5:2:40	and 
268	5:3:17	5:3:18	three inch 
269	5:3:30	5:3:33	then 
270	5:3:45	5:3:45	and there  a plane crash 
272	5:4:46	5:4:47	away about like four inch four or five inch 
273	5:4:48	5:4:56	what 
274	5:6:5	5:6:10	maybe like 
275	5:10:55	5:11:2	uhm 
277	5:11:45	5:11:52	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
279	5:17:3	5:17:10	ok 
281	5:20:38	5:20:41	be IY in like almost the top of the 
283	5:23:19	5:23:28	uhm and there be a stony desert 
284	5:24:37	5:24:37	be IY in like 
285	5:25:19	5:25:27	no 
287	5:28:5	5:28:11	and then IY be go down 
288	5:30:22	5:30:30	IY be go like 
290	5:31:59	5:32:0	and it slope a little bit to the right 
291	5:31:56	5:32:0	straight up 
292	5:33:21	5:33:26	ok 
293	5:38:35	5:38:44	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
294	5:41:1	5:41:2	ok 
295	5:41:55	5:41:59	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
296	5:42:0	5:42:3	five 
297	5:43:44	5:43:47	IY get 
301	5:47:12	5:47:19	plane crash 
302	5:48:21	5:48:22	ok 
303	5:48:45	5:48:48	ok 
304	5:50:4	5:50:7	and then IY slope 
305	5:50:7	5:50:14	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
306	5:51:42	5:51:48	and IY be slope to the leave 
307	5:52:10	5:52:19	IY wanna kind of curve 
308	5:52:25	5:52:28	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
309	5:53:21	5:53:27	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
310	5:54:43	5:54:48	and IY be go up like 
312	5:58:18	5:58:19	ok 
313	5:58:36	5:58:44	ok 
314	6:0:13	6:0:22	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
315	6:2:50	6:2:53	uhm 
318	6:6:8	6:6:14	IY be kind of go 
320	6:7:27	6:7:30	IY do n know 
321	6:10:24	6:10:32	IY just kind of slope down 
322	6:11:24	6:11:26	a little 
323	6:11:47	6:11:53	right next to circle should be roman bath 
325	6:16:14	6:16:14	so  about IY would say 
326	6:16:43	6:16:49	go up like three three and a half inch 
327	6:17:1	6:17:2	slight 
328	6:18:38	6:18:38	well alright 
330	6:19:13	6:19:19	IY be start at the stony desert 
331	6:21:40	6:21:41	from 
332	6:22:32	6:22:36	and IY be go straight up 
333	6:23:14	6:23:14	and IY be go 
334	6:24:49	6:24:56	maybe 
335	6:28:29	6:28:33	just do it like this ok 
336	6:31:11	6:31:16	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
337	6:35:44	6:35:53	uhm 
339	6:39:30	6:39:35	uhm IY straighten out slope 
340	6:40:21	6:40:28	well 
341	6:40:26	6:40:32	four or five inch to the leave 
342	6:42:15	6:42:21	after plane crash 
start f
0	0:1:14	0:1:18	ok 
1	0:2:35	0:2:35	do IY go through anything 
5	0:7:50	0:7:52	ok 
6	0:7:53	0:8:2	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
16	0:20:43	0:20:50	ok 
22	0:29:23	0:29:31	IY hit some rock though 
24	0:31:13	0:31:15	it  not like in the same place IY be describe 
27	0:31:59	0:32:7	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
31	0:35:29	0:35:30	ok 
32	0:35:41	0:35:43	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
36	0:37:43	0:37:44	yeah IY see 
41	0:41:30	0:41:39	uh IY do n know know what to say 
44	0:44:50	0:44:59	so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
47	0:47:58	0:48:6	ok 
48	0:48:13	0:48:22	nope 
51	0:52:16	0:52:18	yeah 
56	1:0:20	1:0:24	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
57	1:3:54	1:3:56	ok 
59	1:5:12	1:5:16	mm hmm 
61	1:6:8	1:6:12	ok

79	1:28:48	1:28:50	so wait 
83	1:33:59	1:34:8	but  like five six inch from where IY be now 
87	1:38:55	1:39:1	ok 
88	1:39:35	1:39:44	how many inch do IY think 
92	1:44:32	1:44:40	around the top of the lake 
98	2:1:7	2:1:9	ok 
100	2:5:29	2:5:33	yeah 
101	2:6:0	2:6:1	nope IY have a white mountain 
102	2:5:59	2:6:5	IY have a plane crash though 
106	2:15:13	2:15:13	ok 
108	2:16:45	2:16:45	and curve down to the leave

119	2:30:55	2:31:2	mm hmm 
127	2:41:13	2:41:16	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
129	2:42:59	2:43:8	up tp the right 
133	2:46:23	2:46:29	ok 
134	2:47:4	2:47:11	IY be three inch above the savannah 
144	2:53:0	2:53:5	and there  a collapse shelter 
146	2:58:37	2:58:46	do IY go by the plane crash 
150	3:6:13	3:6:19	ok 
151	3:9:3	3:9:6	ok 
158	3:14:40	3:14:42	ok

243	4:34:28	4:34:35	IY have plane crash IY be talk about earlier  up there 
248	4:44:10	4:44:12	IY have to back up a little bit 
250	4:45:38	4:45:39	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map

286	5:26:33	5:26:40	ok 
289	5:31:49	5:31:58	plane crash IY do n think be yeah 
298	5:44:14	5:44:20	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
299	5:44:51	5:44:59	ok

4	0:6:59	0:7:1	and then 
7	0:8:48	0:8:55	they be there 
8	0:10:36	0:10:37	to the leave 
9	0:10:42	0:10:42	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
10	0:12:23	0:12:30	and be to the leave 
11	0:15:50	0:15:53	a little bit too 
12	0:17:37	0:17:45	ok and then IY be go

53	0:55:58	0:56:6	to the leave of little path where path should be 
54	0:57:55	0:57:57	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
55	0:58:29	0:58:33	no IY have 
58	1:4:52	1:4:52	so IY go three inch straight 
60	1:5:53	1:5:56	ok

69	1:17:27	1:17:30	like 
70	1:18:1	1:18:4	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
71	1:18:35	1:18:43	just a slight slope 
72	1:19:5	1:19:14	like four or five inch to the leave 
73	1:20:56	1:21:0	to right 
76	1:25:56	1:25:59	IY be go about 
77	1:26:17	1:26:26	like an inch

82	1:33:1	1:33:7	three inch straight across 
84	1:35:15	1:35:23	ok plane crash be n there 
85	1:38:1	1:38:6	IY be actually start like right 
86	1:38:7	1:38:14	no IY do n have any rock 
89	1:42:49	1:42:56	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
90	1:43:0	1:43:1	ok 
91	1:43:53	1:43:58	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
93	1:46:11	1:46:19	and slope be about an inch long 
94	1:53:44	1:53:52	about like 
95	1:58:14	1:58:22	but 
96	1:59:4	1:59:6	uhm

104	2:11:4	2:11:9	around the bottom of it 
105	2:12:7	2:12:9	and then IY be 
107	2:16:13	2:16:21	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
109	2:16:43	2:16:50	like 
110	2:17:19	2:17:22	a quarter of an inch 
111	2:19:2	2:19:9	uhm

116	2:26:7	2:26:13	and 
118	2:26:57	2:26:58	to the right 
120	2:31:42	2:31:42	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
121	2:31:54	2:32:1	and then IY slope up 
122	2:32:9	2:32:10	yes IY be go towards the lake 
123	2:32:12	2:32:17	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
124	2:32:17	2:32:18	like three inch 
125	2:40:31	2:40:35	ok 
126	2:40:31	2:40:37	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
128	2:41:10	2:41:17	and then IY you go up 
130	2:43:24	2:43:24	like 
131	2:44:25	2:44:32	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
132	2:45:20	2:45:24	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
135	2:47:57	2:48:6	and then IY go 
136	2:48:36	2:48:41	uhm 
137	2:48:49	2:48:53	for like 
138	2:49:16	2:49:25	and

142	2:51:57	2:52:6	ok 
143	2:52:45	2:52:48	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
145	2:55:9	2:55:15	alright be IY start near the 
147	3:1:43	3:1:47	like maybe an inch 
148	3:5:20	3:5:23	and IY should have a straight line there 
149	3:6:6	3:6:14	for about two inch 
152	3:10:32	3:10:39	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
153	3:10:55	3:11:0	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
154	3:11:51	3:11:55	and then 
155	3:12:0	3:12:7	and then 
156	3:13:51	3:13:58	be IY anywhere near there 
157	3:14:26	3:14:35	and 
159	3:16:40	3:16:41	after IY go straight again 
161	3:17:11	3:17:20	ok

166	3:22:59	3:23:6	to the lake 
169	3:25:42	3:25:49	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
170	3:26:28	3:26:34	be the plane crash 
171	3:27:3	3:27:9	maybe like 
173	3:28:34	3:28:38	after the circle 
176	3:29:29	3:29:35	no IY do n have a waterhole 
177	3:30:21	3:30:29	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
178	3:31:11	3:31:14	ok IY be at the savannah 
179	3:31:23	3:31:23	so 
180	3:32:0	3:32:2	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
181	3:34:20	3:34:20	an inch maybe a little bit less 
183	3:34:43	3:34:51	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
184	3:36:12	3:36:18	uhm 
185	3:36:28	3:36:30	be IY 
187	3:38:6	3:38:7	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
188	3:38:28	3:38:33	uhm 
190	3:40:2	3:40:4	be IY anywere near there 
191	3:41:55	3:42:1	alright 
192	3:42:7	3:42:14	after IY slope down IY will say 
194	3:45:0	3:45:3	uhm 
195	3:47:27	3:47:27	kind of across from stony desert 
196	3:48:58	3:49:2	IY be at the plane crash 
197	3:48:59	3:49:8	IY slope down again 
198	3:49:43	3:49:50	and IY just go straight up 
199	3:51:41	3:51:49	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
204	3:54:52	3:54:56	like IY be slope 
205	3:55:38	3:55:45	to the leave 
206	3:55:55	3:56:1	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
207	3:57:21	3:57:26	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
209	3:58:44	3:58:49	on sheet anyway 
210	3:58:51	3:58:56	uhm 
211	3:58:55	3:58:56	couple inch IY be slope down 
212	3:59:4	3:59:10	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
213	3:59:16	3:59:18	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
214	3:59:33	3:59:34	three inch 
216	4:0:40	4:0:45	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
217	4:1:5	4:1:10	no there  no elephant 
218	4:1:53	4:2:2	ok 
220	4:5:53	4:5:56	to the white mountain 
221	4:6:34	4:6:41	and then IY will come to a savannah 
223	4:7:6	4:7:15	and then 
224	4:7:27	4:7:33	and then 
225	4:9:13	4:9:20	ok 
226	4:10:17	4:10:20	and then IY go straight 
227	4:11:25	4:11:25	so IY be at the hot spring 
228	4:11:48	4:11:50	ok 
229	4:14:51	4:14:54	ok 
230	4:15:44	4:15:50	and then 
231	4:16:31	4:16:32	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
232	4:19:58	4:20:5	ok 
233	4:22:42	4:22:47	for like 
234	4:22:57	4:23:0	it  not a big curve 
236	4:26:27	4:26:29	what 
238	4:27:31	4:27:31	there  a there  
240	4:28:7	4:28:14	the

247	4:40:58	4:41:6	ok 
249	4:44:7	4:44:15	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
251	4:45:34	4:45:40	and then IY slope down to the leave 
253	4:48:24	4:48:24	uhm 
254	4:48:44	4:48:44	have a s 
256	4:49:28	4:49:29	and then 
257	4:51:5	4:51:11	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
258	4:51:26	4:51:30	IY go straight down 
259	4:53:21	4:53:23	couple mile or something 
260	4:57:14	4:57:20	yes 
261	4:57:19	4:57:23	and  where the plane crash be 
262	4:57:21	4:57:25	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
263	4:57:52	4:57:57	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
264	4:58:30	4:58:35	probably the same thing 
265	4:59:10	4:59:12	hmm 
266	5:0:23	5:0:25	IY be slope 
267	5:2:34	5:2:40	and 
268	5:3:17	5:3:18	three inch 
269	5:3:30	5:3:33	then 
270	5:3:45	5:3:45	and there  a plane crash 
272	5:4:46	5:4:47	away about like four inch four or five inch 
273	5:4:48	5:4:56	what 
274	5:6:5	5:6:10	maybe like 
275	5:10:55	5:11:2	uhm 
277	5:11:45	5:11:52	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
279	5:17:3	5:17:10	ok 
281	5:20:38	5:20:41	be IY in like almost the top of the 
283	5:23:19	5:23:28	uhm and there be a stony desert 
284	5:24:37	5:24:37	be IY in like 
285	5:25:19	5:25:27	no 
287	5:28:5	5:28:11	and then IY be go down 
288	5:30:22	5:30:30	IY be go like 
290	5:31:59	5:32:0	and it slope a little bit to the right 
291	5:31:56	5:32:0	straight up 
292	5:33:21	5:33:26	ok 
293	5:38:35	5:38:44	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
294	5:41:1	5:41:2	ok 
295	5:41:55	5:41:59	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
296	5:42:0	5:42:3	five 
297	5:43:44	5:43:47	IY get 
301	5:47:12	5:47:19	plane crash 
302	5:48:21	5:48:22	ok 
303	5:48:45	5:48:48	ok 
304	5:50:4	5:50:7	and then IY slope 
305	5:50:7	5:50:14	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
306	5:51:42	5:51:48	and IY be slope to the leave 
307	5:52:10	5:52:19	IY wanna kind of curve 
308	5:52:25	5:52:28	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
309	5:53:21	5:53:27	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
310	5:54:43	5:54:48	and IY be go up like 
312	5:58:18	5:58:19	ok 
313	5:58:36	5:58:44	ok
