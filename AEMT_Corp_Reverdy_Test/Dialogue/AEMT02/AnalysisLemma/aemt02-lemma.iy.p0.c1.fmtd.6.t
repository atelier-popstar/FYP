0	0:0:15	0:0:22	maybe 
2	0:1:26	0:1:35	and then 
3	0:3:52	0:3:55	like IY be slope 
4	0:4:4	0:4:13	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
7	0:8:0	0:8:6	slight 
9	0:10:15	0:10:18	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
10	0:12:54	0:13:2	IY move to the leave 
11	0:16:7	0:16:9	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
12	0:16:37	0:16:41	ok 
13	0:20:22	0:20:26	then 
14	0:23:10	0:23:12	ok 
15	0:23:22	0:23:29	uhhh no 
16	0:23:56	0:24:2	IY go straight down 
17	0:24:28	0:24:33	ok 
18	0:25:31	0:25:39	IY wanna kind of curve 
19	0:25:45	0:25:48	around the bottom of it 
20	0:25:50	0:25:53	straight up 
21	0:26:47	0:26:49	from 
22	0:32:46	0:32:49	no IY do n have any rock 
23	0:34:29	0:34:32	on sheet anyway 
24	0:34:47	0:34:54	and then IY slope up 
26	0:35:14	0:35:22	and then 
28	0:38:9	0:38:14	ok 
29	0:39:1	0:39:9	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
34	0:49:33	0:49:35	couple mile or something 
35	0:51:57	0:52:2	ok 
36	0:55:12	0:55:16	ok and then IY be go 
37	0:57:26	0:57:28	and slope be about an inch long 
38	0:58:34	0:58:42	ok well 
40	1:0:27	1:0:30	be IY in like 
42	1:2:13	1:2:17	what 
44	1:6:10	1:6:11	uhm 
45	1:7:43	1:7:44	ok IY be at the savannah 
49	1:13:28	1:13:33	be IY 
50	1:14:14	1:14:22	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
51	1:14:32	1:14:38	go up like three three and a half inch 
52	1:14:54	1:15:0	ok 
54	1:19:29	1:19:32	and then 
55	1:21:15	1:21:17	and 
56	1:22:39	1:22:43	and be to the leave 
60	1:27:9	1:27:9	there  a there  
63	1:30:4	1:30:6	ok 
66	1:32:1	1:32:7	and IY be slope to the leave 
68	1:33:10	1:33:16	three inch 
69	1:36:37	1:36:40	ok 
70	1:36:46	1:36:51	uhm 
71	1:36:53	1:36:56	an inch maybe a little bit less 
73	1:38:52	1:38:54	like 
74	1:38:55	1:39:1	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
75	1:39:28	1:39:35	hmm 
76	1:40:8	1:40:14	no IY do n have a waterhole 
77	1:40:47	1:40:50	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
78	1:40:53	1:41:2	IY 
79	1:41:9	1:41:12	and 
81	1:43:31	1:43:39	IY do n know 
82	1:44:27	1:44:27	uhm 
83	1:44:49	1:44:55	alright 
85	1:45:53	1:45:57	for like 
86	1:46:4	1:46:7	IY be just go down 
87	1:46:22	1:46:29	to right 
90	1:47:41	1:47:45	IY be go like 
92	1:49:15	1:49:22	and 
93	1:50:0	1:50:1	uhm IY straighten out slope 
94	1:50:18	1:50:22	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
95	1:50:49	1:50:54	IY just kind of slope down 
96	1:51:36	1:51:37	just do it like this ok 
97	1:51:48	1:51:56	ok 
98	1:53:17	1:53:25	ok 
99	1:54:56	1:55:0	like an inch 
100	1:55:28	1:55:30	be IY anywhere near there 
101	1:56:43	1:56:51	ok 
102	1:57:18	1:57:20	three inch straight across 
103	1:58:9	1:58:13	ok 
104	1:58:28	1:58:32	a quarter of an inch 
105	1:58:50	1:58:58	no 
106	1:59:59	2:0:1	uhm 
107	2:0:11	2:0:20	to the leave of little path where path should be 
109	2:1:10	2:1:16	so  about IY would say 
110	2:6:15	2:6:16	it  right next to it 
111	2:7:40	2:7:45	and IY just go straight up 
112	2:10:15	2:10:20	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
114	2:12:2	2:12:8	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
115	2:13:13	2:13:13	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
116	2:13:48	2:13:52	the slate mountain be towards the right 
117	2:19:29	2:19:38	ok 
118	2:19:38	2:19:43	ok 
119	2:22:43	2:22:48	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
121	2:25:0	2:25:5	the 
122	2:27:52	2:28:0	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
124	2:29:44	2:29:53	and IY should have a straight line there 
125	2:31:5	2:31:5	and IY be go 
126	2:33:54	2:33:58	maybe IY have different thing 
127	2:34:7	2:34:8	ok 
128	2:36:0	2:36:9	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
129	2:36:11	2:36:17	so IY be at the hot spring 
131	2:42:37	2:42:43	so 
133	2:43:45	2:43:49	uhm 
134	2:43:54	2:44:0	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
136	2:44:45	2:44:50	and then IY will come to a savannah 
137	2:45:13	2:45:19	for like 
138	2:45:59	2:46:2	to the white mountain 
139	2:50:18	2:50:26	IY be actually start like right 
142	2:51:0	2:51:8	like 
143	2:51:48	2:51:51	IY be at the plane crash 
144	2:53:19	2:53:28	probably the same thing 
145	2:54:26	2:54:27	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
146	2:55:29	2:55:33	be IY anywere near there 
147	2:56:38	2:56:44	uhm 
149	2:57:54	2:58:3	ok well 
152	3:1:2	3:1:9	ok 
153	3:1:18	3:1:25	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
154	3:2:1	3:2:9	a little 
155	3:2:10	3:2:14	like four or five inch to the leave 
156	3:2:51	3:2:53	for about two inch 
157	3:4:22	3:4:27	yes 
159	3:5:21	3:5:29	well 
160	3:7:45	3:7:48	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
162	3:10:38	3:10:45	after IY slope down IY will say 
163	3:13:34	3:13:39	and then IY you go up 
164	3:14:28	3:14:34	uhm 
165	3:16:1	3:16:4	be the plane crash 
166	3:16:45	3:16:50	ok 
168	3:19:22	3:19:28	yes IY be go towards the lake 
169	3:20:25	3:20:32	and then IY be 
170	3:21:40	3:21:47	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
171	3:22:3	3:22:9	uhm 
174	3:26:27	3:26:35	after IY go straight again 
175	3:26:44	3:26:52	ok 
177	3:28:27	3:28:30	ok 
178	3:30:34	3:30:39	ok 
179	3:31:38	3:31:46	about like 
180	3:32:22	3:32:25	so anyway 
182	3:33:35	3:33:39	uh like 
183	3:34:15	3:34:21	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
185	3:35:47	3:35:52	maybe like 
187	3:36:39	3:36:42	IY have a waterhole on map 
189	3:40:26	3:40:32	right next to circle should be roman bath 
190	3:40:42	3:40:47	like maybe an inch 
191	3:43:35	3:43:39	uhm 
193	3:45:2	3:45:10	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
194	3:45:16	3:45:16	maybe like 
195	3:45:40	3:45:48	do IY have roman bath 
196	3:46:24	3:46:26	ok 
197	3:47:28	3:47:28	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
203	3:54:5	3:54:10	like 
204	3:55:52	3:55:59	uhm 
205	3:56:23	3:56:29	like 
206	3:56:43	3:56:45	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
207	3:57:37	3:57:40	ok 
209	3:59:12	3:59:17	no IY have 
210	3:59:24	3:59:28	IY be go about 
211	4:1:30	4:1:35	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
215	4:5:20	4:5:27	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
218	4:7:39	4:7:39	and there  a plane crash 
219	4:7:46	4:7:55	yes 
220	4:8:45	4:8:47	alright well IY will keep go and see 
222	4:12:58	4:13:2	IY get 
223	4:13:49	4:13:57	well 
224	4:14:28	4:14:28	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
225	4:14:49	4:14:52	ok 
226	4:15:38	4:15:45	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
227	4:15:57	4:15:58	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
228	4:16:51	4:16:52	IY slope down again 
229	4:17:0	4:17:0	after the circle 
230	4:17:30	4:17:36	well just 
232	4:18:52	4:18:57	and it slope a little bit to the right 
233	4:19:33	4:19:39	be IY in like almost the top of the 
235	4:20:1	4:20:2	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
237	4:21:7	4:21:8	uhm 
238	4:21:11	4:21:18	five 
240	4:23:31	4:23:35	to the lake 
241	4:24:52	4:24:55	but 
242	4:25:40	4:25:49	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
243	4:27:54	4:27:59	like three inch 
244	4:28:0	4:28:0	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
245	4:28:58	4:29:4	IY would say 
249	4:37:38	4:37:45	ok 
250	4:37:51	4:37:55	ok 
251	4:41:0	4:41:9	IY be start 
252	4:43:33	4:43:37	it  not a big curve 
253	4:44:5	4:44:7	uhm 
255	4:44:34	4:44:36	and IY be go up like 
257	4:47:52	4:47:55	alright alright well just 
258	4:48:20	4:48:24	 little slope 
260	4:55:21	4:55:23	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
261	4:55:43	4:55:50	maybe four inch on the paper 
262	4:55:49	4:55:51	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
265	4:57:32	4:57:37	just a slight slope 
266	4:59:28	4:59:30	so IY make circle 
267	5:1:45	5:1:51	and then 
268	5:2:40	5:2:43	IY make 
269	5:4:26	5:4:32	and then 
270	5:7:34	5:7:39	and then IY slope down to the leave 
271	5:8:14	5:8:22	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
272	5:10:43	5:10:50	to the leave 
273	5:11:9	5:11:14	and then IY go straight 
274	5:11:43	5:11:47	IY be kind of go 
275	5:13:40	5:13:48	and then 
276	5:14:13	5:14:17	alright be IY start near the 
277	5:16:26	5:16:27	to the leave 
279	5:17:29	5:17:36	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
280	5:18:46	5:18:54	 about five or six inch 
281	5:19:6	5:19:12	uhm 
282	5:19:24	5:19:31	plane crash 
283	5:23:19	5:23:28	have a s 
284	5:23:33	5:23:40	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
286	5:30:0	5:30:2	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
287	5:32:54	5:32:57	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
288	5:35:11	5:35:17	to the leave 
290	5:39:30	5:39:32	kind of across from stony desert 
292	5:39:53	5:39:59	not right at the stony desert 
293	5:40:31	5:40:34	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
294	5:41:59	5:42:7	no 
295	5:42:12	5:42:14	so IY go three inch straight 
296	5:44:40	5:44:48	to the right 
297	5:45:13	5:45:22	they be there 
298	5:46:6	5:46:11	away about like four inch four or five inch 
299	5:49:9	5:49:17	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
300	5:49:28	5:49:32	after plane crash 
301	5:50:27	5:50:27	four or five inch to the leave 
302	5:50:41	5:50:42	IY be slope 
303	5:51:20	5:51:20	and then IY be go down 
304	5:54:34	5:54:38	alright 
305	5:55:54	5:56:1	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
306	5:56:43	5:56:50	and then 
307	5:58:3	5:58:9	what 
309	5:59:34	5:59:41	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
310	6:2:6	6:2:8	well alright 
312	6:4:3	6:4:10	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
315	6:6:8	6:6:8	and  where the plane crash be 
316	6:7:10	6:7:11	uhm 
318	6:9:27	6:9:36	and IY be go straight up 
320	6:10:33	6:10:42	IY be start at the stony desert 
321	6:14:7	6:14:8	and 
325	6:19:34	6:19:36	and then IY go 
326	6:19:38	6:19:44	and then IY slope 
327	6:20:2	6:20:7	uhm and there be a stony desert 
328	6:20:50	6:20:56	uhm 
329	6:21:12	6:21:16	a little bit too 
331	6:24:7	6:24:11	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
332	6:25:18	6:25:20	uhm 
333	6:25:15	6:25:23	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
334	6:25:27	6:25:31	couple inch IY be slope down 
335	6:25:47	6:25:47	uhm 
336	6:26:33	6:26:39	ok plane crash be n there 
337	6:31:13	6:31:20	no there  no elephant 
339	6:32:47	6:32:51	three inch 
340	6:33:17	6:33:22	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
342	6:36:35	6:36:37	and then 
start f
1	0:1:9	0:1:17	and then what 
5	0:4:26	0:4:32	ok 
6	0:7:49	0:7:49	IY go to a lake 
8	0:10:8	0:10:15	no IY will go with hot spring IY have 
25	0:34:50	0:34:54	but  like five six inch from where IY be now 
27	0:38:7	0:38:13	and there  a collapse shelter 
30	0:44:47	0:44:54	yeah IY see 
31	0:46:3	0:46:8	to the leave of the antelope 
32	0:48:10	0:48:10	ok 
33	0:48:16	0:48:22	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
39	0:59:39	0:59:48	ok 
41	1:1:42	1:1:43	yep 
43	1:5:7	1:5:14	ok

65	1:32:0	1:32:4	how many inch do IY think 
67	1:33:5	1:33:5	uhm 
72	1:37:56	1:38:4	yeah

89	1:46:50	1:46:55	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
91	1:48:13	1:48:17	ok

141	2:50:58	2:50:58	so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
148	2:57:32	2:57:32	and to the right 
150	2:58:27	2:58:36	IY be start yeah the stony desert 
151	2:58:54	2:58:56	ok

259	4:54:12	4:54:14	mm hmm 
263	4:57:14	4:57:17	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
264	4:57:33	4:57:33	to the right 
278	5:17:29	5:17:33	mm hmm 
285	5:29:36	5:29:37	IY hit some rock though 
289	5:36:17	5:36:17	IY have a plane crash though 
291	5:39:45	5:39:48	yeah 
308	5:58:30	5:58:39	IY have plane crash IY be talk about earlier  up there 
311	6:2:14	6:2:15	ok 
313	6:4:24	6:4:28	ok 
314	6:4:57	6:5:1	do IY go by the plane crash 
317	6:8:7	6:8:14	ok 
319	6:9:42	6:9:44	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
322	6:16:8	6:16:11	do IY hit anything when IY go down

324	6:18:56	6:19:5	ok 
330	6:23:32	6:23:40	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
338	6:31:13	6:31:22	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
341	6:35:50	6:35:57	and curve down to the leave 
start g
0	0:0:15	0:0:22	maybe 
2	0:1:26	0:1:35	and then 
3	0:3:52	0:3:55	like IY be slope 
4	0:4:4	0:4:13	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
7	0:8:0	0:8:6	slight 
9	0:10:15	0:10:18	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
10	0:12:54	0:13:2	IY move to the leave 
11	0:16:7	0:16:9	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch

17	0:24:28	0:24:33	ok 
18	0:25:31	0:25:39	IY wanna kind of curve 
19	0:25:45	0:25:48	around the bottom of it 
20	0:25:50	0:25:53	straight up 
21	0:26:47	0:26:49	from 
22	0:32:46	0:32:49	no IY do n have any rock

35	0:51:57	0:52:2	ok 
36	0:55:12	0:55:16	ok and then IY be go 
37	0:57:26	0:57:28	and slope be about an inch long 
38	0:58:34	0:58:42	ok well 
40	1:0:27	1:0:30	be IY in like 
42	1:2:13	1:2:17	what

45	1:7:43	1:7:44	ok IY be at the savannah 
49	1:13:28	1:13:33	be IY 
50	1:14:14	1:14:22	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
51	1:14:32	1:14:38	go up like three three and a half inch 
52	1:14:54	1:15:0	ok 
54	1:19:29	1:19:32	and then

66	1:32:1	1:32:7	and IY be slope to the leave 
68	1:33:10	1:33:16	three inch 
69	1:36:37	1:36:40	ok 
70	1:36:46	1:36:51	uhm 
71	1:36:53	1:36:56	an inch maybe a little bit less 
73	1:38:52	1:38:54	like 
74	1:38:55	1:39:1	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
75	1:39:28	1:39:35	hmm 
76	1:40:8	1:40:14	no IY do n have a waterhole 
77	1:40:47	1:40:50	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
78	1:40:53	1:41:2	IY 
79	1:41:9	1:41:12	and 
81	1:43:31	1:43:39	IY do n know

83	1:44:49	1:44:55	alright 
85	1:45:53	1:45:57	for like 
86	1:46:4	1:46:7	IY be just go down 
87	1:46:22	1:46:29	to right 
90	1:47:41	1:47:45	IY be go like 
92	1:49:15	1:49:22	and 
93	1:50:0	1:50:1	uhm IY straighten out slope 
94	1:50:18	1:50:22	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
95	1:50:49	1:50:54	IY just kind of slope down 
96	1:51:36	1:51:37	just do it like this ok 
97	1:51:48	1:51:56	ok 
98	1:53:17	1:53:25	ok 
99	1:54:56	1:55:0	like an inch 
100	1:55:28	1:55:30	be IY anywhere near there 
101	1:56:43	1:56:51	ok 
102	1:57:18	1:57:20	three inch straight across 
103	1:58:9	1:58:13	ok 
104	1:58:28	1:58:32	a quarter of an inch 
105	1:58:50	1:58:58	no 
106	1:59:59	2:0:1	uhm 
107	2:0:11	2:0:20	to the leave of little path where path should be 
109	2:1:10	2:1:16	so  about IY would say 
110	2:6:15	2:6:16	it  right next to it 
111	2:7:40	2:7:45	and IY just go straight up 
112	2:10:15	2:10:20	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
114	2:12:2	2:12:8	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
115	2:13:13	2:13:13	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
116	2:13:48	2:13:52	the slate mountain be towards the right 
117	2:19:29	2:19:38	ok 
118	2:19:38	2:19:43	ok 
119	2:22:43	2:22:48	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
121	2:25:0	2:25:5	the 
122	2:27:52	2:28:0	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
124	2:29:44	2:29:53	and IY should have a straight line there 
125	2:31:5	2:31:5	and IY be go 
126	2:33:54	2:33:58	maybe IY have different thing 
127	2:34:7	2:34:8	ok 
128	2:36:0	2:36:9	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
129	2:36:11	2:36:17	so IY be at the hot spring 
131	2:42:37	2:42:43	so 
133	2:43:45	2:43:49	uhm 
134	2:43:54	2:44:0	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
136	2:44:45	2:44:50	and then IY will come to a savannah 
137	2:45:13	2:45:19	for like 
138	2:45:59	2:46:2	to the white mountain 
139	2:50:18	2:50:26	IY be actually start like right 
142	2:51:0	2:51:8	like 
143	2:51:48	2:51:51	IY be at the plane crash 
144	2:53:19	2:53:28	probably the same thing 
145	2:54:26	2:54:27	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
146	2:55:29	2:55:33	be IY anywere near there 
147	2:56:38	2:56:44	uhm 
149	2:57:54	2:58:3	ok well 
152	3:1:2	3:1:9	ok 
153	3:1:18	3:1:25	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
154	3:2:1	3:2:9	a little 
155	3:2:10	3:2:14	like four or five inch to the leave 
156	3:2:51	3:2:53	for about two inch 
157	3:4:22	3:4:27	yes 
159	3:5:21	3:5:29	well 
160	3:7:45	3:7:48	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
162	3:10:38	3:10:45	after IY slope down IY will say 
163	3:13:34	3:13:39	and then IY you go up 
164	3:14:28	3:14:34	uhm 
165	3:16:1	3:16:4	be the plane crash 
166	3:16:45	3:16:50	ok 
168	3:19:22	3:19:28	yes IY be go towards the lake 
169	3:20:25	3:20:32	and then IY be 
170	3:21:40	3:21:47	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
171	3:22:3	3:22:9	uhm 
174	3:26:27	3:26:35	after IY go straight again 
175	3:26:44	3:26:52	ok 
177	3:28:27	3:28:30	ok 
178	3:30:34	3:30:39	ok 
179	3:31:38	3:31:46	about like 
180	3:32:22	3:32:25	so anyway 
182	3:33:35	3:33:39	uh like 
183	3:34:15	3:34:21	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
185	3:35:47	3:35:52	maybe like 
187	3:36:39	3:36:42	IY have a waterhole on map 
189	3:40:26	3:40:32	right next to circle should be roman bath 
190	3:40:42	3:40:47	like maybe an inch 
191	3:43:35	3:43:39	uhm 
193	3:45:2	3:45:10	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
194	3:45:16	3:45:16	maybe like 
195	3:45:40	3:45:48	do IY have roman bath 
196	3:46:24	3:46:26	ok 
197	3:47:28	3:47:28	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
203	3:54:5	3:54:10	like 
204	3:55:52	3:55:59	uhm 
205	3:56:23	3:56:29	like 
206	3:56:43	3:56:45	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
207	3:57:37	3:57:40	ok 
209	3:59:12	3:59:17	no IY have 
210	3:59:24	3:59:28	IY be go about 
211	4:1:30	4:1:35	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
215	4:5:20	4:5:27	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
218	4:7:39	4:7:39	and there  a plane crash 
219	4:7:46	4:7:55	yes 
220	4:8:45	4:8:47	alright well IY will keep go and see 
222	4:12:58	4:13:2	IY get 
223	4:13:49	4:13:57	well 
224	4:14:28	4:14:28	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
225	4:14:49	4:14:52	ok 
226	4:15:38	4:15:45	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
227	4:15:57	4:15:58	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
228	4:16:51	4:16:52	IY slope down again 
229	4:17:0	4:17:0	after the circle 
230	4:17:30	4:17:36	well just 
232	4:18:52	4:18:57	and it slope a little bit to the right 
233	4:19:33	4:19:39	be IY in like almost the top of the 
235	4:20:1	4:20:2	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
237	4:21:7	4:21:8	uhm 
238	4:21:11	4:21:18	five 
240	4:23:31	4:23:35	to the lake 
241	4:24:52	4:24:55	but 
242	4:25:40	4:25:49	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
243	4:27:54	4:27:59	like three inch 
244	4:28:0	4:28:0	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
245	4:28:58	4:29:4	IY would say 
249	4:37:38	4:37:45	ok 
250	4:37:51	4:37:55	ok 
251	4:41:0	4:41:9	IY be start 
252	4:43:33	4:43:37	it  not a big curve 
253	4:44:5	4:44:7	uhm 
255	4:44:34	4:44:36	and IY be go up like 
257	4:47:52	4:47:55	alright alright well just 
258	4:48:20	4:48:24	 little slope 
260	4:55:21	4:55:23	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
261	4:55:43	4:55:50	maybe four inch on the paper 
262	4:55:49	4:55:51	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
265	4:57:32	4:57:37	just a slight slope 
266	4:59:28	4:59:30	so IY make circle 
267	5:1:45	5:1:51	and then 
268	5:2:40	5:2:43	IY make 
269	5:4:26	5:4:32	and then 
270	5:7:34	5:7:39	and then IY slope down to the leave 
271	5:8:14	5:8:22	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
272	5:10:43	5:10:50	to the leave 
273	5:11:9	5:11:14	and then IY go straight 
274	5:11:43	5:11:47	IY be kind of go 
275	5:13:40	5:13:48	and then 
276	5:14:13	5:14:17	alright be IY start near the 
277	5:16:26	5:16:27	to the leave 
279	5:17:29	5:17:36	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
280	5:18:46	5:18:54	 about five or six inch 
281	5:19:6	5:19:12	uhm 
282	5:19:24	5:19:31	plane crash 
283	5:23:19	5:23:28	have a s 
284	5:23:33	5:23:40	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
286	5:30:0	5:30:2	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
287	5:32:54	5:32:57	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
288	5:35:11	5:35:17	to the leave 
290	5:39:30	5:39:32	kind of across from stony desert 
292	5:39:53	5:39:59	not right at the stony desert 
293	5:40:31	5:40:34	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
294	5:41:59	5:42:7	no 
295	5:42:12	5:42:14	so IY go three inch straight 
296	5:44:40	5:44:48	to the right 
297	5:45:13	5:45:22	they be there 
298	5:46:6	5:46:11	away about like four inch four or five inch 
299	5:49:9	5:49:17	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
300	5:49:28	5:49:32	after plane crash 
301	5:50:27	5:50:27	four or five inch to the leave 
302	5:50:41	5:50:42	IY be slope 
303	5:51:20	5:51:20	and then IY be go down 
304	5:54:34	5:54:38	alright 
305	5:55:54	5:56:1	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
306	5:56:43	5:56:50	and then 
307	5:58:3	5:58:9	what 
309	5:59:34	5:59:41	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert
