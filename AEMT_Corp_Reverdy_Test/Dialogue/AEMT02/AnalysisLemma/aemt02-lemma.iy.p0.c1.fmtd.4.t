start g
0	0:0:28	0:0:29	IY be slope 
1	0:1:24	0:1:27	just do it like this ok 
4	0:4:30	0:4:39	no IY have 
6	0:6:9	0:6:17	and then 
7	0:7:32	0:7:35	uhm 
8	0:8:17	0:8:17	three inch straight across 
10	0:12:22	0:12:28	and then IY go 
13	0:16:1	0:16:1	uhm 
14	0:17:46	0:17:47	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
15	0:18:1	0:18:10	uhm 
17	0:20:1	0:20:9	so IY make circle 
18	0:20:25	0:20:27	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
19	0:21:41	0:21:42	and then IY be go down 
20	0:22:20	0:22:27	so anyway 
21	0:24:8	0:24:11	no IY do n have a waterhole 
22	0:24:37	0:24:46	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
23	0:26:42	0:26:51	well just 
24	0:27:11	0:27:20	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
26	0:27:41	0:27:41	IY 
27	0:29:25	0:29:30	what 
28	0:29:42	0:29:50	an inch maybe a little bit less 
30	0:32:40	0:32:45	uhm 
31	0:33:38	0:33:38	uhm 
32	0:38:33	0:38:40	maybe IY have different thing 
33	0:39:25	0:39:33	IY just kind of slope down 
34	0:40:33	0:40:42	ok 
36	0:41:43	0:41:46	have a s 
37	0:43:4	0:43:9	go up like three three and a half inch 
38	0:44:57	0:44:59	IY be go about 
39	0:45:26	0:45:27	for about two inch 
40	0:48:12	0:48:21	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
41	0:49:45	0:49:46	IY slope down again 
42	0:54:53	0:54:59	uhm 
43	0:57:29	0:57:33	to right 
45	0:58:3	0:58:7	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
46	0:58:19	0:58:27	it  right next to it 
47	0:59:52	0:59:57	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
50	1:1:52	1:1:56	around the bottom of it 
51	1:4:45	1:4:45	uhm 
52	1:7:31	1:7:32	IY would say 
53	1:8:13	1:8:17	ok 
55	1:12:47	1:12:48	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
57	1:13:31	1:13:31	alright 
58	1:14:32	1:14:35	ok 
60	1:15:17	1:15:22	uhm 
61	1:15:34	1:15:39	a little bit too 
62	1:15:34	1:15:41	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
63	1:20:56	1:21:1	uhm and there be a stony desert 
65	1:22:36	1:22:36	ok 
66	1:22:48	1:22:51	a quarter of an inch 
67	1:23:41	1:23:44	but 
69	1:25:48	1:25:54	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
70	1:28:42	1:28:51	IY be start 
71	1:29:5	1:29:14	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
72	1:30:48	1:30:48	about like 
73	1:33:52	1:33:56	like three inch 
74	1:34:23	1:34:32	right next to circle should be roman bath 
75	1:35:35	1:35:36	what 
77	1:38:9	1:38:12	uhm 
78	1:38:36	1:38:44	four or five inch to the leave 
80	1:40:11	1:40:16	maybe like 
82	1:42:32	1:42:36	uhm 
83	1:42:35	1:42:44	and IY just go straight up 
85	1:44:2	1:44:10	a little 
86	1:45:22	1:45:28	well 
88	1:47:40	1:47:41	and it slope a little bit to the right 
89	1:47:49	1:47:58	ok 
90	1:48:21	1:48:29	it  not a big curve 
91	1:49:23	1:49:29	and then IY be 
92	1:53:29	1:53:37	and then 
95	1:56:8	1:56:8	so 
96	1:57:19	1:57:23	and IY should have a straight line there 
97	1:57:36	1:57:42	IY be kind of go 
98	1:58:38	1:58:45	 about five or six inch 
99	2:0:54	2:0:54	IY be actually start like right 
100	2:3:13	2:3:17	and be to the leave 
102	2:3:20	2:3:28	couple inch IY be slope down 
103	2:5:8	2:5:16	no IY do n have any rock 
104	2:5:44	2:5:49	ok 
105	2:7:38	2:7:45	then 
106	2:9:59	2:10:2	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
107	2:10:28	2:10:37	to the lake 
108	2:11:25	2:11:34	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
109	2:12:29	2:12:29	be the plane crash 
110	2:13:56	2:14:5	ok 
111	2:14:36	2:14:42	IY get 
112	2:16:19	2:16:24	ok and then IY be go 
115	2:20:30	2:20:32	be IY 
116	2:22:15	2:22:17	to the leave of little path where path should be 
117	2:22:57	2:23:2	be IY in like 
118	2:23:9	2:23:14	yes 
120	2:23:43	2:23:50	and then 
121	2:24:29	2:24:33	and 
122	2:24:33	2:24:40	ok 
123	2:25:22	2:25:29	and 
125	2:26:21	2:26:27	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
126	2:26:40	2:26:40	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
128	2:30:4	2:30:11	like 
130	2:38:47	2:38:50	no 
131	2:42:22	2:42:24	the 
132	2:44:44	2:44:44	IY wanna kind of curve 
133	2:44:42	2:44:49	on sheet anyway 
134	2:44:56	2:44:59	and then 
136	2:47:45	2:47:53	alright be IY start near the 
138	2:50:53	2:50:57	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
139	2:50:54	2:50:58	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
140	2:51:9	2:51:14	ok IY be at the savannah 
142	2:52:13	2:52:13	like maybe an inch 
143	2:52:24	2:52:32	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
144	2:53:39	2:53:41	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
145	2:54:58	2:55:6	five 
147	2:55:37	2:55:41	to the white mountain 
149	2:57:10	2:57:12	and IY be go straight up 
150	2:57:55	2:58:1	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
151	2:58:4	2:58:6	they be there 
155	3:0:29	3:0:29	ok well 
157	3:4:19	3:4:27	three inch 
162	3:9:43	3:9:49	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
163	3:11:54	3:11:56	ok 
164	3:12:44	3:12:51	and slope be about an inch long 
165	3:12:49	3:12:58	and 
166	3:13:21	3:13:21	IY make 
168	3:14:25	3:14:29	ok 
169	3:14:46	3:14:46	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
170	3:15:50	3:15:56	for like 
171	3:17:12	3:17:17	uhm 
172	3:19:53	3:20:0	uhm 
173	3:19:54	3:20:1	and then 
174	3:19:59	3:20:5	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
177	3:25:18	3:25:27	from 
178	3:27:10	3:27:16	uhm 
180	3:28:56	3:29:4	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
181	3:29:56	3:30:4	no there  no elephant 
182	3:30:22	3:30:26	just a slight slope 
186	3:36:16	3:36:16	and IY be go 
187	3:36:37	3:36:38	uhm 
188	3:36:44	3:36:51	alright alright well just 
189	3:37:26	3:37:33	and then IY slope up 
191	3:38:35	3:38:43	after IY slope down IY will say 
192	3:38:43	3:38:47	and then IY you go up 
195	3:44:15	3:44:23	ok 
197	3:45:8	3:45:13	yes IY be go towards the lake 
199	3:48:54	3:48:56	and there  a plane crash 
200	3:48:52	3:48:58	ok 
201	3:50:21	3:50:23	no 
203	3:54:31	3:54:32	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
204	3:54:37	3:54:41	and 
205	3:58:8	3:58:15	and then 
206	3:58:43	3:58:52	ok 
207	3:59:8	3:59:15	after the circle 
208	3:59:20	3:59:25	and then IY will come to a savannah 
209	4:2:1	4:2:1	ok 
211	4:6:34	4:6:36	maybe 
212	4:7:46	4:7:54	like IY be slope 
213	4:9:14	4:9:19	not right at the stony desert 
214	4:9:48	4:9:54	ok 
215	4:11:59	4:12:6	straight up 
216	4:13:11	4:13:20	 little slope 
217	4:13:34	4:13:39	IY do n know 
218	4:15:21	4:15:28	there  a there  
219	4:16:24	4:16:27	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
220	4:18:18	4:18:25	do IY have roman bath 
223	4:21:24	4:21:29	maybe four inch on the paper 
224	4:24:15	4:24:19	ok 
226	4:25:0	4:25:8	and then 
227	4:25:24	4:25:33	ok 
229	4:29:56	4:29:59	couple mile or something 
230	4:31:31	4:31:39	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
232	4:32:8	4:32:16	ok 
233	4:32:42	4:32:51	alright 
235	4:33:35	4:33:44	uhm 
236	4:35:8	4:35:14	plane crash 
238	4:36:5	4:36:13	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
239	4:36:31	4:36:34	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
241	4:37:16	4:37:20	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
242	4:39:40	4:39:43	IY move to the leave 
243	4:41:28	4:41:28	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
244	4:46:18	4:46:27	like an inch 
245	4:48:9	4:48:15	kind of across from stony desert 
246	4:49:33	4:49:40	so IY be at the hot spring 
247	4:50:55	4:51:2	ok 
248	4:52:49	4:52:58	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
249	4:52:53	4:53:0	and then IY slope 
250	4:53:24	4:53:31	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
251	4:53:50	4:53:54	and IY be slope to the leave 
253	4:55:39	4:55:39	so  about IY would say 
254	4:56:30	4:56:37	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
256	4:57:38	4:57:42	uhm IY straighten out slope 
257	4:59:8	4:59:12	well 
259	5:1:11	5:1:19	ok 
262	5:2:24	5:2:26	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
263	5:4:10	5:4:10	slight 
264	5:4:8	5:4:15	ok plane crash be n there 
265	5:5:33	5:5:34	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
266	5:7:40	5:7:46	like 
267	5:9:36	5:9:37	to the leave 
268	5:9:57	5:10:1	ok 
269	5:10:30	5:10:39	to the leave 
270	5:11:39	5:11:39	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
272	5:19:56	5:20:5	uhm 
273	5:20:23	5:20:26	like four or five inch to the leave 
274	5:20:41	5:20:45	IY be go like 
275	5:22:29	5:22:35	and then 
276	5:22:53	5:22:57	yes 
277	5:24:22	5:24:31	hmm 
279	5:25:28	5:25:34	for like 
281	5:26:5	5:26:10	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
282	5:26:25	5:26:32	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
283	5:28:22	5:28:29	so IY go three inch straight 
285	5:31:20	5:31:20	IY be just go down 
286	5:35:13	5:35:18	IY have a waterhole on map 
287	5:36:22	5:36:23	ok 
288	5:36:31	5:36:37	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
289	5:36:58	5:37:5	be IY anywhere near there 
291	5:40:46	5:40:48	three inch 
292	5:41:16	5:41:24	like 
293	5:41:29	5:41:31	ok 
294	5:43:45	5:43:51	probably the same thing 
296	5:45:47	5:45:54	maybe like 
297	5:45:47	5:45:55	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
298	5:46:21	5:46:26	ok 
299	5:46:25	5:46:27	be IY in like almost the top of the 
300	5:46:38	5:46:40	uh like 
301	5:47:56	5:47:56	ok well 
302	5:48:1	5:48:5	and then IY slope down to the leave 
303	5:49:56	5:49:56	to the leave 
307	5:54:35	5:54:43	well alright 
308	5:57:30	5:57:37	away about like four inch four or five inch 
310	6:0:27	6:0:33	IY go straight down 
311	6:2:9	6:2:10	after IY go straight again 
312	6:2:33	6:2:33	to the right 
316	6:8:13	6:8:19	alright well IY will keep go and see 
317	6:14:19	6:14:21	like 
318	6:14:34	6:14:37	the slate mountain be towards the right 
319	6:15:45	6:15:53	and  where the plane crash be 
320	6:16:48	6:16:51	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
321	6:19:1	6:19:4	uhm 
322	6:19:16	6:19:16	after plane crash 
323	6:19:23	6:19:27	IY be at the plane crash 
325	6:19:59	6:20:5	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
326	6:27:45	6:27:46	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
327	6:27:51	6:27:54	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
329	6:29:9	6:29:10	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
330	6:29:17	6:29:22	and IY be go up like 
332	6:30:33	6:30:34	and then IY go straight 
333	6:31:35	6:31:42	be IY anywere near there 
338	6:38:2	6:38:7	ok 
339	6:38:28	6:38:28	IY be start at the stony desert 
341	6:40:55	6:41:4	uhhh no 
start f
2	0:2:7	0:2:12	yeah 
3	0:3:33	0:3:39	nope IY have a white mountain 
5	0:5:52	0:5:58	ok 
9	0:10:20	0:10:23	ok 
11	0:13:42	0:13:48	ok 
12	0:14:40	0:14:49	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
16	0:18:18	0:18:26	yep 
25	0:27:24	0:27:25	and then what 
29	0:29:59	0:30:6	ok 
35	0:41:39	0:41:39	yeah 
44	0:58:3	0:58:6	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
48	0:59:59	0:59:59	to the leave of the antelope 
49	1:0:49	1:0:55	ok 
54	1:10:5	1:10:6	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
56	1:13:13	1:13:14	elephant 
59	1:14:58	1:14:58	IY know IY have different thing so 
64	1:21:53	1:21:53	ok 
68	1:24:56	1:25:3	do IY go by the plane crash 
76	1:37:54	1:38:3	ok 
79	1:38:56	1:39:5	IY have a plane crash though 
81	1:41:44	1:41:47	ok 
84	1:43:11	1:43:15	ok 
87	1:46:36	1:46:43	yeah IY see

114	2:18:27	2:18:32	but  like five six inch from where IY be now 
119	2:23:38	2:23:39	IY have plane crash IY be talk about earlier  up there 
124	2:25:38	2:25:44	yeah and IY go straight up 
127	2:26:59	2:26:59	to the right 
129	2:30:53	2:30:56	ok 
135	2:47:46	2:47:46	and curve down to the leave 
137	2:48:26	2:48:28	IY be three inch above the savannah 
141	2:51:14	2:51:20	ok

start g
0	0:0:28	0:0:29	IY be slope 
1	0:1:24	0:1:27	just do it like this ok 
4	0:4:30	0:4:39	no IY have

20	0:22:20	0:22:27	so anyway 
21	0:24:8	0:24:11	no IY do n have a waterhole 
22	0:24:37	0:24:46	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
23	0:26:42	0:26:51	well just 
24	0:27:11	0:27:20	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
26	0:27:41	0:27:41	IY 
27	0:29:25	0:29:30	what 
28	0:29:42	0:29:50	an inch maybe a little bit less

36	0:41:43	0:41:46	have a s 
37	0:43:4	0:43:9	go up like three three and a half inch 
38	0:44:57	0:44:59	IY be go about 
39	0:45:26	0:45:27	for about two inch 
40	0:48:12	0:48:21	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
41	0:49:45	0:49:46	IY slope down again 
42	0:54:53	0:54:59	uhm 
43	0:57:29	0:57:33	to right 
45	0:58:3	0:58:7	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
46	0:58:19	0:58:27	it  right next to it 
47	0:59:52	0:59:57	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
50	1:1:52	1:1:56	around the bottom of it 
51	1:4:45	1:4:45	uhm 
52	1:7:31	1:7:32	IY would say 
53	1:8:13	1:8:17	ok

61	1:15:34	1:15:39	a little bit too 
62	1:15:34	1:15:41	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
63	1:20:56	1:21:1	uhm and there be a stony desert 
65	1:22:36	1:22:36	ok 
66	1:22:48	1:22:51	a quarter of an inch 
67	1:23:41	1:23:44	but 
69	1:25:48	1:25:54	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
70	1:28:42	1:28:51	IY be start 
71	1:29:5	1:29:14	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
72	1:30:48	1:30:48	about like 
73	1:33:52	1:33:56	like three inch 
74	1:34:23	1:34:32	right next to circle should be roman bath 
75	1:35:35	1:35:36	what 
77	1:38:9	1:38:12	uhm 
78	1:38:36	1:38:44	four or five inch to the leave

104	2:5:44	2:5:49	ok 
105	2:7:38	2:7:45	then 
106	2:9:59	2:10:2	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
107	2:10:28	2:10:37	to the lake 
108	2:11:25	2:11:34	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
109	2:12:29	2:12:29	be the plane crash 
110	2:13:56	2:14:5	ok 
111	2:14:36	2:14:42	IY get 
112	2:16:19	2:16:24	ok and then IY be go

125	2:26:21	2:26:27	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
126	2:26:40	2:26:40	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
128	2:30:4	2:30:11	like 
130	2:38:47	2:38:50	no 
131	2:42:22	2:42:24	the

140	2:51:9	2:51:14	ok IY be at the savannah 
142	2:52:13	2:52:13	like maybe an inch 
143	2:52:24	2:52:32	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
144	2:53:39	2:53:41	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
145	2:54:58	2:55:6	five 
147	2:55:37	2:55:41	to the white mountain 
149	2:57:10	2:57:12	and IY be go straight up 
150	2:57:55	2:58:1	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well

197	3:45:8	3:45:13	yes IY be go towards the lake 
199	3:48:54	3:48:56	and there  a plane crash 
200	3:48:52	3:48:58	ok 
201	3:50:21	3:50:23	no 
203	3:54:31	3:54:32	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
204	3:54:37	3:54:41	and 
205	3:58:8	3:58:15	and then 
206	3:58:43	3:58:52	ok 
207	3:59:8	3:59:15	after the circle 
208	3:59:20	3:59:25	and then IY will come to a savannah 
209	4:2:1	4:2:1	ok 
211	4:6:34	4:6:36	maybe 
212	4:7:46	4:7:54	like IY be slope

215	4:11:59	4:12:6	straight up 
216	4:13:11	4:13:20	 little slope 
217	4:13:34	4:13:39	IY do n know 
218	4:15:21	4:15:28	there  a there  
219	4:16:24	4:16:27	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
220	4:18:18	4:18:25	do IY have roman bath 
223	4:21:24	4:21:29	maybe four inch on the paper 
224	4:24:15	4:24:19	ok 
226	4:25:0	4:25:8	and then 
227	4:25:24	4:25:33	ok

235	4:33:35	4:33:44	uhm 
236	4:35:8	4:35:14	plane crash 
238	4:36:5	4:36:13	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
239	4:36:31	4:36:34	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
241	4:37:16	4:37:20	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
242	4:39:40	4:39:43	IY move to the leave

244	4:46:18	4:46:27	like an inch 
245	4:48:9	4:48:15	kind of across from stony desert 
246	4:49:33	4:49:40	so IY be at the hot spring 
247	4:50:55	4:51:2	ok 
248	4:52:49	4:52:58	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
249	4:52:53	4:53:0	and then IY slope 
250	4:53:24	4:53:31	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
251	4:53:50	4:53:54	and IY be slope to the leave 
253	4:55:39	4:55:39	so  about IY would say 
254	4:56:30	4:56:37	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
256	4:57:38	4:57:42	uhm IY straighten out slope 
257	4:59:8	4:59:12	well 
259	5:1:11	5:1:19	ok 
262	5:2:24	5:2:26	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
263	5:4:10	5:4:10	slight 
264	5:4:8	5:4:15	ok plane crash be n there 
265	5:5:33	5:5:34	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
266	5:7:40	5:7:46	like 
267	5:9:36	5:9:37	to the leave 
268	5:9:57	5:10:1	ok 
269	5:10:30	5:10:39	to the leave 
270	5:11:39	5:11:39	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
272	5:19:56	5:20:5	uhm 
273	5:20:23	5:20:26	like four or five inch to the leave 
274	5:20:41	5:20:45	IY be go like 
275	5:22:29	5:22:35	and then 
276	5:22:53	5:22:57	yes 
277	5:24:22	5:24:31	hmm 
279	5:25:28	5:25:34	for like 
281	5:26:5	5:26:10	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
282	5:26:25	5:26:32	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
283	5:28:22	5:28:29	so IY go three inch straight 
285	5:31:20	5:31:20	IY be just go down 
286	5:35:13	5:35:18	IY have a waterhole on map 
287	5:36:22	5:36:23	ok 
288	5:36:31	5:36:37	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
289	5:36:58	5:37:5	be IY anywhere near there 
291	5:40:46	5:40:48	three inch 
292	5:41:16	5:41:24	like 
293	5:41:29	5:41:31	ok

296	5:45:47	5:45:54	maybe like 
297	5:45:47	5:45:55	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
298	5:46:21	5:46:26	ok 
299	5:46:25	5:46:27	be IY in like almost the top of the 
300	5:46:38	5:46:40	uh like 
301	5:47:56	5:47:56	ok well 
302	5:48:1	5:48:5	and then IY slope down to the leave
