start
0:4:12	0:4:12	g	ok IY be at the savannah 
0:4:51	0:4:59	f	yeah IY see 
0:5:7	0:5:10	g	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
0:5:38	0:5:43	g	ok 
0:6:12	0:6:15	g	they be there 
0:6:58	0:7:3	g	ok and then IY be go 
0:7:15	0:7:24	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
0:8:26	0:8:34	g	three inch straight across 
0:8:51	0:8:53	g	go up like three three and a half inch 
0:9:17	0:9:17	f	yep 
0:9:23	0:9:23	g	and  where the plane crash be 
0:9:25	0:9:25	f	ok 
0:9:26	0:9:32	f	yeah 
0:10:46	0:10:53	g	maybe IY have different thing 
0:11:18	0:11:26	f	and to the right 
0:12:26	0:12:26	f	mm mm 
0:13:17	0:13:21	g	like IY be slope 
0:14:57	0:15:5	g	IY go straight down 
0:15:40	0:15:48	g	and 
0:18:13	0:18:20	f	nope 
0:18:55	0:19:2	g	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
0:19:56	0:20:5	f	yeah 
0:21:33	0:21:42	f	ok 
0:26:43	0:26:48	f	and curve down to the leave 
0:26:48	0:26:53	g	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
0:30:30	0:30:32	g	like 
0:30:30	0:30:34	g	IY just kind of slope down 
0:33:51	0:33:52	g	like three inch 
0:34:41	0:34:48	g	and then IY be go down 
0:38:14	0:38:16	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
0:39:18	0:39:27	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
0:39:38	0:39:38	g	not right at the stony desert 
0:39:45	0:39:51	g	ok 
0:40:50	0:40:53	g	ok 
0:41:56	0:42:2	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
0:42:6	0:42:12	f	ok 
0:45:2	0:45:4	f	yeah 
0:45:56	0:46:5	g	ok 
0:46:43	0:46:49	f	IY have plane crash IY be talk about earlier  up there 
0:47:20	0:47:21	g	well 
0:48:9	0:48:14	g	IY wanna kind of curve 
0:50:40	0:50:44	g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
0:52:2	0:52:2	f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
0:52:8	0:52:10	g	have a s 
0:52:31	0:52:34	g	IY make 
0:52:36	0:52:39	g	uhm 
0:54:16	0:54:17	f	ok 
0:55:46	0:55:53	f	IY be three inch above the savannah 
0:56:10	0:56:15	g	uhm 
1:0:8	1:0:11	g	well just 
1:1:41	1:1:50	g	maybe 
1:2:8	1:2:17	g	three inch 
1:2:46	1:2:53	f	ok 
1:3:14	1:3:23	g	and there  a plane crash 
1:5:1	1:5:4	g	like an inch 
1:6:26	1:6:31	g	no IY do n have any rock 
1:6:36	1:6:37	g	IY be start 
1:7:16	1:7:23	g	and IY be go straight up 
1:8:46	1:8:46	g	yes 
1:9:15	1:9:17	g	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
1:11:12	1:11:16	g	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
1:12:54	1:13:3	f	ok 
1:15:3	1:15:10	f	to the right 
1:15:13	1:15:17	f	IY know IY have different thing so 
1:17:8	1:17:14	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
1:18:30	1:18:32	g	straight up 
1:20:1	1:20:4	g	and be to the leave 
1:21:27	1:21:31	g	just a slight slope 
1:21:54	1:21:55	g	uhm 
1:21:49	1:21:56	f	and 
1:24:23	1:24:30	g	uhm 
1:24:25	1:24:33	g	uhm 
1:25:42	1:25:48	g	uhm 
1:26:32	1:26:38	g	be IY in like almost the top of the 
1:27:35	1:27:35	g	uhm 
1:29:34	1:29:39	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
1:30:32	1:30:41	f	IY hit some round rock 
1:31:27	1:31:31	g	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
1:32:16	1:32:24	g	IY be start at the stony desert 
1:35:0	1:35:2	g	alright alright well just 
1:35:47	1:35:55	g	for like 
1:36:29	1:36:38	g	and 
1:37:29	1:37:38	g	slight 
1:38:50	1:38:57	g	 about five or six inch 
1:39:27	1:39:35	f	ok 
1:39:35	1:39:40	f	yeah and IY go straight up 
1:40:9	1:40:9	g	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
1:40:15	1:40:22	g	be IY anywhere near there 
1:40:33	1:40:39	g	an inch maybe a little bit less 
1:41:34	1:41:40	g	so 
1:41:35	1:41:43	f	to 
1:41:58	1:42:6	g	uhm 
1:44:22	1:44:27	f	oh 
1:44:32	1:44:40	f	ok 
1:44:39	1:44:40	g	to the leave 
1:45:51	1:45:54	f	IY have to back up a little bit 
1:46:8	1:46:14	g	the 
1:48:49	1:48:51	g	and 
1:49:18	1:49:20	g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
1:50:40	1:50:49	g	and 
1:50:48	1:50:57	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
1:51:16	1:51:17	g	like 
1:54:7	1:54:13	g	three inch 
1:54:48	1:54:53	g	no there  no elephant 
1:57:16	1:57:22	g	to the leave 
1:57:32	1:57:36	g	no 
1:57:53	1:57:55	g	ok 
1:58:25	1:58:30	f	mm hmm 
1:58:56	1:59:5	g	a quarter of an inch 
1:59:1	1:59:10	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
1:59:26	1:59:35	f	uhm 
2:2:51	2:2:54	f	and then what 
2:2:56	2:3:2	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
2:4:17	2:4:21	g	uhm and there be a stony desert 
2:9:26	2:9:29	g	ok 
2:9:37	2:9:43	f	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
2:9:49	2:9:51	g	couple inch IY be slope down 
2:11:25	2:11:31	g	what 
2:11:30	2:11:36	f	ok 
2:11:38	2:11:46	g	like 
2:12:36	2:12:40	f	ok 
2:12:44	2:12:53	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
2:13:20	2:13:21	f	ok 
2:15:20	2:15:22	g	maybe four inch on the paper 
2:19:0	2:19:2	g	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
2:19:32	2:19:37	f	mm hmm 
2:20:22	2:20:28	g	just do it like this ok 
2:21:17	2:21:20	f	do IY go through anything 
2:21:54	2:21:58	g	and IY be go 
2:22:54	2:23:2	g	be IY 
2:24:23	2:24:30	g	ok 
2:25:33	2:25:41	g	and then IY slope 
2:25:53	2:25:53	g	be the plane crash 
2:25:53	2:25:56	g	uhhh no 
2:26:27	2:26:30	g	alright 
2:26:56	2:26:59	g	and IY be go up like 
2:27:37	2:27:44	g	ok 
2:27:51	2:27:57	f	ok 
2:31:3	2:31:3	g	for about two inch 
2:31:37	2:31:43	g	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
2:32:37	2:32:42	g	ok 
2:33:4	2:33:4	f	IY go to a lake 
2:33:21	2:33:28	f	around the top of the lake 
2:33:45	2:33:51	g	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
2:40:4	2:40:11	g	after IY go straight again 
2:42:14	2:42:15	g	after IY slope down IY will say 
2:45:22	2:45:27	g	IY do n know 
2:45:45	2:45:49	g	alright be IY start near the 
2:46:0	2:46:8	g	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
2:46:37	2:46:44	f	ok wait hold on 
2:46:45	2:46:49	g	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
2:47:15	2:47:17	g	uhm 
2:47:15	2:47:17	g	alright well IY will keep go and see 
2:47:29	2:47:38	g	so anyway 
2:49:47	2:49:51	g	yes IY be go towards the lake 
2:50:45	2:50:54	g	to the leave 
2:50:52	2:50:56	g	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
2:50:56	2:51:3	g	no 
2:51:19	2:51:26	g	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
2:51:45	2:51:53	g	so IY make circle 
2:52:7	2:52:13	g	after plane crash 
2:52:38	2:52:38	f	so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
2:56:54	2:56:57	g	it  not a big curve 
2:57:38	2:57:45	g	kind of across from stony desert 
2:58:9	2:58:15	g	hmm 
2:58:22	2:58:27	g	five 
2:59:19	2:59:27	f	ok 
2:59:47	2:59:55	g	and IY just go straight up 
3:2:9	3:2:9	g	like maybe an inch 
3:3:37	3:3:38	g	ok 
3:4:38	3:4:40	f	to the leave 
3:5:42	3:5:47	g	well alright 
3:6:15	3:6:19	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
3:6:34	3:6:41	g	ok 
3:10:27	3:10:31	g	uhm 
3:10:30	3:10:35	g	to the right 
3:11:47	3:11:49	g	uhm 
3:12:33	3:12:40	f	yeah 
3:12:52	3:12:54	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
3:13:0	3:13:6	g	IY be slope 
3:13:36	3:13:45	f	ok 
3:13:38	3:13:47	g	and then 
3:14:21	3:14:25	f	ok 
3:17:26	3:17:29	g	what 
3:17:28	3:17:37	g	and then 
3:17:33	3:17:41	f	IY be at the savannah 
3:18:27	3:18:36	g	like four or five inch to the leave 
3:20:14	3:20:18	g	no IY have 
3:21:13	3:21:22	g	and then IY be 
3:22:31	3:22:39	g	ok 
3:26:53	3:27:0	f	ok 
3:27:4	3:27:5	g	ok 
3:27:30	3:27:33	g	uhm 
3:28:37	3:28:42	g	yes 
3:32:56	3:32:58	f	around the lake to the top 
3:33:6	3:33:9	g	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
3:33:36	3:33:40	g	maybe like 
3:34:37	3:34:39	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
3:35:50	3:35:50	f	mm hmm 
3:36:11	3:36:15	g	ok 
3:37:38	3:37:43	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
3:39:13	3:39:14	f	plane crash IY do n think be yeah 
3:40:24	3:40:29	g	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
3:40:44	3:40:45	f	ok 
3:41:12	3:41:16	g	to the lake 
3:41:50	3:41:54	g	ok 
3:46:14	3:46:17	g	uhm 
3:46:37	3:46:46	g	and then 
3:47:50	3:47:53	g	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
3:49:3	3:49:4	g	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
3:49:20	3:49:23	g	and then 
3:50:21	3:50:23	f	yeah 
3:53:0	3:53:1	g	probably the same thing 
3:53:29	3:53:34	f	ok 
3:54:24	3:54:29	g	maybe like 
3:55:17	3:55:18	g	but 
3:55:49	3:55:49	g	ok 
3:57:5	3:57:9	g	and then IY go straight 
3:57:48	3:57:50	g	well 
3:58:34	3:58:39	g	then 
3:59:38	3:59:43	g	no IY do n have a waterhole 
3:59:41	3:59:47	g	IY slope down again 
4:0:30	4:0:38	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
4:0:36	4:0:41	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
4:0:58	4:1:3	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
4:1:16	4:1:21	g	plane crash 
4:2:38	4:2:40	f	ok 
4:7:24	4:7:32	f	how many inch do IY think 
4:9:33	4:9:40	g	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
4:11:3	4:11:9	g	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
4:11:43	4:11:51	f	up tp the right 
4:13:42	4:13:46	f	no IY will go with hot spring IY have 
4:14:8	4:14:14	f	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
4:15:29	4:15:29	g	IY be go about 
4:19:6	4:19:8	f	IY hit some rock though 
4:20:3	4:20:7	g	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
4:24:33	4:24:39	g	IY be go like 
4:24:51	4:24:55	g	away about like four inch four or five inch 
4:25:34	4:25:36	g	so IY be at the hot spring 
4:28:32	4:28:40	g	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
4:29:12	4:29:15	f	ok 
4:29:54	4:29:57	g	for like 
4:30:29	4:30:30	g	ok well 
4:30:50	4:30:56	g	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
4:31:30	4:31:33	g	about like 
4:33:38	4:33:46	g	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
4:33:59	4:34:0	f	yeah 
4:36:0	4:36:1	g	like 
4:40:38	4:40:42	f	ok 
4:43:17	4:43:17	g	ok 
4:43:35	4:43:39	f	mm hmm 
4:43:46	4:43:55	g	be IY anywere near there 
4:44:0	4:44:7	g	ok 
4:44:4	4:44:9	f	mm hmm 
4:44:41	4:44:49	g	IY 
4:44:47	4:44:51	g	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
4:48:16	4:48:20	f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
4:49:38	4:49:42	g	and then IY you go up 
4:50:35	4:50:38	g	uhm 
4:51:17	4:51:21	g	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
4:54:21	4:54:22	g	to right 
4:57:23	4:57:23	g	IY get 
4:57:31	4:57:35	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
4:57:51	4:57:57	g	IY be just go down 
4:57:59	4:58:1	g	do IY have roman bath 
4:57:59	4:58:3	g	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
4:58:31	4:58:34	g	and then IY go 
4:59:56	5:0:2	g	and then 
5:0:7	5:0:16	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
5:0:15	5:0:22	g	ok 
5:0:56	5:0:57	g	around the bottom of it 
5:1:23	5:1:25	g	IY be actually start like right 
5:3:27	5:3:30	g	and then 
5:6:52	5:6:58	g	so  about IY would say 
5:8:2	5:8:5	f	do IY go around it 
5:9:0	5:9:7	g	a little bit too 
5:11:15	5:11:23	g	ok plane crash be n there 
5:13:0	5:13:7	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
5:14:43	5:14:49	g	uh like 
5:15:15	5:15:21	f	but  like five six inch from where IY be now 
5:16:11	5:16:20	f	it  not like in the same place IY be describe 
5:19:0	5:19:7	g	ok well 
5:19:27	5:19:29	g	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
5:22:38	5:22:45	g	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
5:24:35	5:24:38	f	ok 
5:24:57	5:24:57	g	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
5:25:24	5:25:33	g	after the circle 
5:26:31	5:26:34	g	a little 
5:26:52	5:27:1	f	ok 
5:27:6	5:27:14	g	IY would say 
5:27:43	5:27:52	g	so IY go three inch straight 
5:28:10	5:28:14	f	and there  a collapse shelter 
5:28:28	5:28:36	g	uhm 
5:28:58	5:29:4	g	ok 
5:31:54	5:32:3	f	mm hmm 
5:33:11	5:33:20	g	to the white mountain 
5:38:26	5:38:35	g	and then IY slope up 
5:38:47	5:38:56	g	four or five inch to the leave 
5:39:41	5:39:43	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
5:40:41	5:40:43	g	and then 
5:45:9	5:45:9	g	IY be at the plane crash 
5:47:1	5:47:7	g	uhm 
5:47:4	5:47:10	g	IY have a waterhole on map 
5:47:35	5:47:42	g	and it slope a little bit to the right
