start
start g
0	0:4:12	0:4:12	ok IY be at the savannah 
2	0:5:7	0:5:10	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
3	0:5:38	0:5:43	ok 
4	0:6:12	0:6:15	they be there 
5	0:6:58	0:7:3	ok and then IY be go 
6	0:7:15	0:7:24	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
7	0:8:26	0:8:34	three inch straight across 
8	0:8:51	0:8:53	go up like three three and a half inch 
10	0:9:23	0:9:23	and  where the plane crash be 
13	0:10:46	0:10:53	maybe IY have different thing 
16	0:13:17	0:13:21	like IY be slope 
17	0:14:57	0:15:5	IY go straight down 
18	0:15:40	0:15:48	and 
20	0:18:55	0:19:2	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
24	0:26:48	0:26:53	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
25	0:30:30	0:30:32	like 
26	0:30:30	0:30:34	IY just kind of slope down 
27	0:33:51	0:33:52	like three inch 
28	0:34:41	0:34:48	and then IY be go down 
30	0:39:18	0:39:27	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
31	0:39:38	0:39:38	not right at the stony desert 
32	0:39:45	0:39:51	ok 
33	0:40:50	0:40:53	ok 
34	0:41:56	0:42:2	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
37	0:45:56	0:46:5	ok 
39	0:47:20	0:47:21	well 
40	0:48:9	0:48:14	IY wanna kind of curve 
41	0:50:40	0:50:44	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
43	0:52:8	0:52:10	have a s 
44	0:52:31	0:52:34	IY make 
45	0:52:36	0:52:39	uhm 
48	0:56:10	0:56:15	uhm 
49	1:0:8	1:0:11	well just 
50	1:1:41	1:1:50	maybe 
51	1:2:8	1:2:17	three inch 
53	1:3:14	1:3:23	and there  a plane crash 
54	1:5:1	1:5:4	like an inch 
55	1:6:26	1:6:31	no IY do n have any rock 
56	1:6:36	1:6:37	IY be start 
57	1:7:16	1:7:23	and IY be go straight up 
58	1:8:46	1:8:46	yes 
59	1:9:15	1:9:17	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
60	1:11:12	1:11:16	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
65	1:18:30	1:18:32	straight up 
66	1:20:1	1:20:4	and be to the leave 
67	1:21:27	1:21:31	just a slight slope 
68	1:21:54	1:21:55	uhm 
70	1:24:23	1:24:30	uhm 
71	1:24:25	1:24:33	uhm 
72	1:25:42	1:25:48	uhm 
73	1:26:32	1:26:38	be IY in like almost the top of the 
74	1:27:35	1:27:35	uhm 
75	1:29:34	1:29:39	right next to circle should be roman bath 
77	1:31:27	1:31:31	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
78	1:32:16	1:32:24	IY be start at the stony desert 
79	1:35:0	1:35:2	alright alright well just 
80	1:35:47	1:35:55	for like 
81	1:36:29	1:36:38	and 
82	1:37:29	1:37:38	slight 
83	1:38:50	1:38:57	 about five or six inch 
86	1:40:9	1:40:9	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
87	1:40:15	1:40:22	be IY anywhere near there 
88	1:40:33	1:40:39	an inch maybe a little bit less 
89	1:41:34	1:41:40	so 
91	1:41:58	1:42:6	uhm 
94	1:44:39	1:44:40	to the leave 
96	1:46:8	1:46:14	the 
97	1:48:49	1:48:51	and 
98	1:49:18	1:49:20	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
99	1:50:40	1:50:49	and 
101	1:51:16	1:51:17	like 
102	1:54:7	1:54:13	three inch 
103	1:54:48	1:54:53	no there  no elephant 
104	1:57:16	1:57:22	to the leave 
105	1:57:32	1:57:36	no 
106	1:57:53	1:57:55	ok 
108	1:58:56	1:59:5	a quarter of an inch 
109	1:59:1	1:59:10	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
112	2:2:56	2:3:2	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
113	2:4:17	2:4:21	uhm and there be a stony desert 
114	2:9:26	2:9:29	ok 
116	2:9:49	2:9:51	couple inch IY be slope down 
117	2:11:25	2:11:31	what 
119	2:11:38	2:11:46	like 
123	2:15:20	2:15:22	maybe four inch on the paper 
124	2:19:0	2:19:2	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
126	2:20:22	2:20:28	just do it like this ok 
128	2:21:54	2:21:58	and IY be go 
129	2:22:54	2:23:2	be IY 
130	2:24:23	2:24:30	ok 
131	2:25:33	2:25:41	and then IY slope 
132	2:25:53	2:25:53	be the plane crash 
133	2:25:53	2:25:56	uhhh no 
134	2:26:27	2:26:30	alright 
135	2:26:56	2:26:59	and IY be go up like 
136	2:27:37	2:27:44	ok 
138	2:31:3	2:31:3	for about two inch 
139	2:31:37	2:31:43	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
140	2:32:37	2:32:42	ok 
143	2:33:45	2:33:51	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
144	2:40:4	2:40:11	after IY go straight again 
145	2:42:14	2:42:15	after IY slope down IY will say 
146	2:45:22	2:45:27	IY do n know 
147	2:45:45	2:45:49	alright be IY start near the 
148	2:46:0	2:46:8	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
150	2:46:45	2:46:49	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
151	2:47:15	2:47:17	uhm 
152	2:47:15	2:47:17	alright well IY will keep go and see 
153	2:47:29	2:47:38	so anyway 
154	2:49:47	2:49:51	yes IY be go towards the lake 
155	2:50:45	2:50:54	to the leave 
156	2:50:52	2:50:56	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
157	2:50:56	2:51:3	no 
158	2:51:19	2:51:26	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
159	2:51:45	2:51:53	so IY make circle 
160	2:52:7	2:52:13	after plane crash 
162	2:56:54	2:56:57	it  not a big curve 
163	2:57:38	2:57:45	kind of across from stony desert 
164	2:58:9	2:58:15	hmm 
165	2:58:22	2:58:27	five 
167	2:59:47	2:59:55	and IY just go straight up 
168	3:2:9	3:2:9	like maybe an inch 
169	3:3:37	3:3:38	ok 
171	3:5:42	3:5:47	well alright 
173	3:6:34	3:6:41	ok 
174	3:10:27	3:10:31	uhm 
175	3:10:30	3:10:35	to the right 
176	3:11:47	3:11:49	uhm 
178	3:12:52	3:12:54	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
179	3:13:0	3:13:6	IY be slope 
181	3:13:38	3:13:47	and then 
183	3:17:26	3:17:29	what 
184	3:17:28	3:17:37	and then 
186	3:18:27	3:18:36	like four or five inch to the leave 
187	3:20:14	3:20:18	no IY have 
188	3:21:13	3:21:22	and then IY be 
189	3:22:31	3:22:39	ok 
191	3:27:4	3:27:5	ok 
192	3:27:30	3:27:33	uhm 
193	3:28:37	3:28:42	yes 
195	3:33:6	3:33:9	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
196	3:33:36	3:33:40	maybe like 
197	3:34:37	3:34:39	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
199	3:36:11	3:36:15	ok 
200	3:37:38	3:37:43	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
202	3:40:24	3:40:29	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
204	3:41:12	3:41:16	to the lake 
205	3:41:50	3:41:54	ok 
206	3:46:14	3:46:17	uhm 
207	3:46:37	3:46:46	and then 
208	3:47:50	3:47:53	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
209	3:49:3	3:49:4	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
210	3:49:20	3:49:23	and then 
212	3:53:0	3:53:1	probably the same thing 
214	3:54:24	3:54:29	maybe like 
215	3:55:17	3:55:18	but 
216	3:55:49	3:55:49	ok 
217	3:57:5	3:57:9	and then IY go straight 
218	3:57:48	3:57:50	well 
219	3:58:34	3:58:39	then 
220	3:59:38	3:59:43	no IY do n have a waterhole 
221	3:59:41	3:59:47	IY slope down again 
223	4:0:36	4:0:41	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
224	4:0:58	4:1:3	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
225	4:1:16	4:1:21	plane crash 
228	4:9:33	4:9:40	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
229	4:11:3	4:11:9	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
233	4:15:29	4:15:29	IY be go about 
235	4:20:3	4:20:7	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
236	4:24:33	4:24:39	IY be go like 
237	4:24:51	4:24:55	away about like four inch four or five inch 
238	4:25:34	4:25:36	so IY be at the hot spring 
239	4:28:32	4:28:40	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
241	4:29:54	4:29:57	for like 
242	4:30:29	4:30:30	ok well 
243	4:30:50	4:30:56	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
244	4:31:30	4:31:33	about like 
245	4:33:38	4:33:46	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
247	4:36:0	4:36:1	like 
249	4:43:17	4:43:17	ok 
251	4:43:46	4:43:55	be IY anywere near there 
252	4:44:0	4:44:7	ok 
254	4:44:41	4:44:49	IY 
255	4:44:47	4:44:51	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
257	4:49:38	4:49:42	and then IY you go up 
258	4:50:35	4:50:38	uhm 
259	4:51:17	4:51:21	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
260	4:54:21	4:54:22	to right 
261	4:57:23	4:57:23	IY get 
263	4:57:51	4:57:57	IY be just go down 
264	4:57:59	4:58:1	do IY have roman bath 
265	4:57:59	4:58:3	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
266	4:58:31	4:58:34	and then IY go 
267	4:59:56	5:0:2	and then 
268	5:0:7	5:0:16	and IY should have a straight line there 
269	5:0:15	5:0:22	ok 
270	5:0:56	5:0:57	around the bottom of it 
271	5:1:23	5:1:25	IY be actually start like right 
272	5:3:27	5:3:30	and then 
273	5:6:52	5:6:58	so  about IY would say 
275	5:9:0	5:9:7	a little bit too 
276	5:11:15	5:11:23	ok plane crash be n there 
278	5:14:43	5:14:49	uh like 
281	5:19:0	5:19:7	ok well 
282	5:19:27	5:19:29	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
283	5:22:38	5:22:45	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
285	5:24:57	5:24:57	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
286	5:25:24	5:25:33	after the circle 
287	5:26:31	5:26:34	a little 
289	5:27:6	5:27:14	IY would say 
290	5:27:43	5:27:52	so IY go three inch straight 
292	5:28:28	5:28:36	uhm 
293	5:28:58	5:29:4	ok 
295	5:33:11	5:33:20	to the white mountain 
296	5:38:26	5:38:35	and then IY slope up 
297	5:38:47	5:38:56	four or five inch to the leave 
299	5:40:41	5:40:43	and then 
300	5:45:9	5:45:9	IY be at the plane crash 
301	5:47:1	5:47:7	uhm 
302	5:47:4	5:47:10	IY have a waterhole on map 
303	5:47:35	5:47:42	and it slope a little bit to the right 
304	5:49:19	5:49:28	ok 
305	5:49:59	5:50:5	IY be kind of go 
307	5:51:4	5:51:8	on sheet anyway 
308	5:51:1	5:51:9	and slope be about an inch long 
309	5:52:5	5:52:5	alright 
310	5:53:51	5:53:57	there  a there  
312	5:56:42	5:56:48	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
313	5:56:53	5:56:59	ok 
314	5:59:10	5:59:14	and then IY slope down to the leave 
315	5:59:36	5:59:43	ok 
316	5:59:36	5:59:43	and IY be slope to the leave 
318	6:0:18	6:0:27	to the leave of little path where path should be 
319	6:0:49	6:0:52	it  right next to it 
320	6:2:2	6:2:5	uhm 
323	6:7:21	6:7:30	IY move to the leave 
324	6:7:30	6:7:35	the slate mountain be towards the right 
325	6:9:18	6:9:21	and then 
327	6:14:54	6:15:3	ok 
328	6:17:42	6:17:44	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
331	6:20:39	6:20:46	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
332	6:21:34	6:21:41	 little slope 
333	6:22:10	6:22:12	couple mile or something 
334	6:23:32	6:23:32	uhm IY straighten out slope 
337	6:25:28	6:25:28	be IY in like 
338	6:28:6	6:28:14	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
339	6:29:9	6:29:9	from 
340	6:31:33	6:31:38	and then IY will come to a savannah 
341	6:33:30	6:33:31	ok 
start f
1	0:4:51	0:4:59	yeah IY see 
9	0:9:17	0:9:17	yep

19	0:18:13	0:18:20	nope 
21	0:19:56	0:20:5	yeah 
22	0:21:33	0:21:42	ok 
23	0:26:43	0:26:48	and curve down to the leave 
29	0:38:14	0:38:16	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
35	0:42:6	0:42:12	ok 
36	0:45:2	0:45:4	yeah 
38	0:46:43	0:46:49	IY have plane crash IY be talk about earlier  up there 
42	0:52:2	0:52:2	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
46	0:54:16	0:54:17	ok 
47	0:55:46	0:55:53	IY be three inch above the savannah 
52	1:2:46	1:2:53	ok 
61	1:12:54	1:13:3	ok 
62	1:15:3	1:15:10	to the right 
63	1:15:13	1:15:17	IY know IY have different thing so 
64	1:17:8	1:17:14	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
69	1:21:49	1:21:56	and 
76	1:30:32	1:30:41	IY hit some round rock 
84	1:39:27	1:39:35	ok 
85	1:39:35	1:39:40	yeah and IY go straight up 
90	1:41:35	1:41:43	to

95	1:45:51	1:45:54	IY have to back up a little bit 
100	1:50:48	1:50:57	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
107	1:58:25	1:58:30	mm hmm 
110	1:59:26	1:59:35	uhm 
111	2:2:51	2:2:54	and then what 
115	2:9:37	2:9:43	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
118	2:11:30	2:11:36	ok 
120	2:12:36	2:12:40	ok 
121	2:12:44	2:12:53	nope IY have a white mountain 
122	2:13:20	2:13:21	ok

149	2:46:37	2:46:44	ok wait hold on 
161	2:52:38	2:52:38	so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
166	2:59:19	2:59:27	ok 
170	3:4:38	3:4:40	to the leave 
172	3:6:15	3:6:19	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
177	3:12:33	3:12:40	yeah 
180	3:13:36	3:13:45	ok 
182	3:14:21	3:14:25	ok

190	3:26:53	3:27:0	ok 
194	3:32:56	3:32:58	around the lake to the top 
198	3:35:50	3:35:50	mm hmm 
201	3:39:13	3:39:14	plane crash IY do n think be yeah 
203	3:40:44	3:40:45	ok 
211	3:50:21	3:50:23	yeah 
213	3:53:29	3:53:34	ok

253	4:44:4	4:44:9	mm hmm 
256	4:48:16	4:48:20	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
262	4:57:31	4:57:35	do IY go by the plane crash 
274	5:8:2	5:8:5	do IY go around it 
277	5:13:0	5:13:7	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
279	5:15:15	5:15:21	but  like five six inch from where IY be now 
280	5:16:11	5:16:20	it  not like in the same place IY be describe 
284	5:24:35	5:24:38	ok 
288	5:26:52	5:27:1	ok 
291	5:28:10	5:28:14	and there  a collapse shelter 
294	5:31:54	5:32:3	mm hmm 
298	5:39:41	5:39:43	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
306	5:50:21	5:50:23	yeah 
311	5:54:4	5:54:7	IY be start yeah the stony desert 
317	6:0:22	6:0:22	ok 
321	6:4:11	6:4:12	ok 
322	6:7:2	6:7:7	elephant

330	6:19:26	6:19:26	so wait 
335	6:24:29	6:24:29	IY have a plane crash though 
336	6:25:6	6:25:10	ok 
342	6:34:36	6:34:37	uh IY do n know know what to say 
start g
0	0:4:12	0:4:12	ok IY be at the savannah 
2	0:5:7	0:5:10	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
3	0:5:38	0:5:43	ok 
4	0:6:12	0:6:15	they be there 
5	0:6:58	0:7:3	ok and then IY be go 
6	0:7:15	0:7:24	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
7	0:8:26	0:8:34	three inch straight across 
8	0:8:51	0:8:53	go up like three three and a half inch 
10	0:9:23	0:9:23	and  where the plane crash be 
13	0:10:46	0:10:53	maybe IY have different thing 
16	0:13:17	0:13:21	like IY be slope 
17	0:14:57	0:15:5	IY go straight down 
18	0:15:40	0:15:48	and 
20	0:18:55	0:19:2	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
24	0:26:48	0:26:53	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
25	0:30:30	0:30:32	like 
26	0:30:30	0:30:34	IY just kind of slope down 
27	0:33:51	0:33:52	like three inch 
28	0:34:41	0:34:48	and then IY be go down 
30	0:39:18	0:39:27	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
31	0:39:38	0:39:38	not right at the stony desert 
32	0:39:45	0:39:51	ok 
33	0:40:50	0:40:53	ok 
34	0:41:56	0:42:2	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
37	0:45:56	0:46:5	ok 
39	0:47:20	0:47:21	well 
40	0:48:9	0:48:14	IY wanna kind of curve 
41	0:50:40	0:50:44	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
43	0:52:8	0:52:10	have a s 
44	0:52:31	0:52:34	IY make 
45	0:52:36	0:52:39	uhm

51	1:2:8	1:2:17	three inch 
53	1:3:14	1:3:23	and there  a plane crash 
54	1:5:1	1:5:4	like an inch 
55	1:6:26	1:6:31	no IY do n have any rock 
56	1:6:36	1:6:37	IY be start 
57	1:7:16	1:7:23	and IY be go straight up 
58	1:8:46	1:8:46	yes 
59	1:9:15	1:9:17	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
60	1:11:12	1:11:16	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
65	1:18:30	1:18:32	straight up 
66	1:20:1	1:20:4	and be to the leave 
67	1:21:27	1:21:31	just a slight slope 
68	1:21:54	1:21:55	uhm 
70	1:24:23	1:24:30	uhm 
71	1:24:25	1:24:33	uhm

74	1:27:35	1:27:35	uhm 
75	1:29:34	1:29:39	right next to circle should be roman bath 
77	1:31:27	1:31:31	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
78	1:32:16	1:32:24	IY be start at the stony desert 
79	1:35:0	1:35:2	alright alright well just 
80	1:35:47	1:35:55	for like 
81	1:36:29	1:36:38	and 
82	1:37:29	1:37:38	slight 
83	1:38:50	1:38:57	 about five or six inch 
86	1:40:9	1:40:9	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
87	1:40:15	1:40:22	be IY anywhere near there 
88	1:40:33	1:40:39	an inch maybe a little bit less 
89	1:41:34	1:41:40	so 
91	1:41:58	1:42:6	uhm 
94	1:44:39	1:44:40	to the leave

97	1:48:49	1:48:51	and 
98	1:49:18	1:49:20	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
99	1:50:40	1:50:49	and 
101	1:51:16	1:51:17	like 
102	1:54:7	1:54:13	three inch

114	2:9:26	2:9:29	ok 
116	2:9:49	2:9:51	couple inch IY be slope down 
117	2:11:25	2:11:31	what 
119	2:11:38	2:11:46	like 
123	2:15:20	2:15:22	maybe four inch on the paper 
124	2:19:0	2:19:2	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
126	2:20:22	2:20:28	just do it like this ok 
128	2:21:54	2:21:58	and IY be go

130	2:24:23	2:24:30	ok 
131	2:25:33	2:25:41	and then IY slope 
132	2:25:53	2:25:53	be the plane crash 
133	2:25:53	2:25:56	uhhh no 
134	2:26:27	2:26:30	alright 
135	2:26:56	2:26:59	and IY be go up like

140	2:32:37	2:32:42	ok 
143	2:33:45	2:33:51	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
144	2:40:4	2:40:11	after IY go straight again 
145	2:42:14	2:42:15	after IY slope down IY will say 
146	2:45:22	2:45:27	IY do n know 
147	2:45:45	2:45:49	alright be IY start near the 
148	2:46:0	2:46:8	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
150	2:46:45	2:46:49	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
151	2:47:15	2:47:17	uhm 
152	2:47:15	2:47:17	alright well IY will keep go and see 
153	2:47:29	2:47:38	so anyway

155	2:50:45	2:50:54	to the leave 
156	2:50:52	2:50:56	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
157	2:50:56	2:51:3	no 
158	2:51:19	2:51:26	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
159	2:51:45	2:51:53	so IY make circle 
160	2:52:7	2:52:13	after plane crash 
162	2:56:54	2:56:57	it  not a big curve 
163	2:57:38	2:57:45	kind of across from stony desert 
164	2:58:9	2:58:15	hmm 
165	2:58:22	2:58:27	five 
167	2:59:47	2:59:55	and IY just go straight up

176	3:11:47	3:11:49	uhm 
178	3:12:52	3:12:54	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
179	3:13:0	3:13:6	IY be slope 
181	3:13:38	3:13:47	and then 
183	3:17:26	3:17:29	what 
184	3:17:28	3:17:37	and then

193	3:28:37	3:28:42	yes 
195	3:33:6	3:33:9	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
196	3:33:36	3:33:40	maybe like 
197	3:34:37	3:34:39	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
199	3:36:11	3:36:15	ok 
200	3:37:38	3:37:43	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
202	3:40:24	3:40:29	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
204	3:41:12	3:41:16	to the lake 
205	3:41:50	3:41:54	ok 
206	3:46:14	3:46:17	uhm

208	3:47:50	3:47:53	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
209	3:49:3	3:49:4	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
210	3:49:20	3:49:23	and then 
212	3:53:0	3:53:1	probably the same thing 
214	3:54:24	3:54:29	maybe like

216	3:55:49	3:55:49	ok 
217	3:57:5	3:57:9	and then IY go straight 
218	3:57:48	3:57:50	well 
219	3:58:34	3:58:39	then 
220	3:59:38	3:59:43	no IY do n have a waterhole 
221	3:59:41	3:59:47	IY slope down again 
223	4:0:36	4:0:41	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
224	4:0:58	4:1:3	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
225	4:1:16	4:1:21	plane crash 
228	4:9:33	4:9:40	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
229	4:11:3	4:11:9	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
233	4:15:29	4:15:29	IY be go about 
235	4:20:3	4:20:7	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
236	4:24:33	4:24:39	IY be go like 
237	4:24:51	4:24:55	away about like four inch four or five inch 
238	4:25:34	4:25:36	so IY be at the hot spring 
239	4:28:32	4:28:40	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
241	4:29:54	4:29:57	for like 
242	4:30:29	4:30:30	ok well 
243	4:30:50	4:30:56	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
244	4:31:30	4:31:33	about like 
245	4:33:38	4:33:46	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
247	4:36:0	4:36:1	like 
249	4:43:17	4:43:17	ok 
251	4:43:46	4:43:55	be IY anywere near there 
252	4:44:0	4:44:7	ok 
254	4:44:41	4:44:49	IY 
255	4:44:47	4:44:51	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
257	4:49:38	4:49:42	and then IY you go up 
258	4:50:35	4:50:38	uhm 
259	4:51:17	4:51:21	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
260	4:54:21	4:54:22	to right 
261	4:57:23	4:57:23	IY get 
263	4:57:51	4:57:57	IY be just go down 
264	4:57:59	4:58:1	do IY have roman bath 
265	4:57:59	4:58:3	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
266	4:58:31	4:58:34	and then IY go 
267	4:59:56	5:0:2	and then 
268	5:0:7	5:0:16	and IY should have a straight line there 
269	5:0:15	5:0:22	ok 
270	5:0:56	5:0:57	around the bottom of it 
271	5:1:23	5:1:25	IY be actually start like right 
272	5:3:27	5:3:30	and then 
273	5:6:52	5:6:58	so  about IY would say 
275	5:9:0	5:9:7	a little bit too 
276	5:11:15	5:11:23	ok plane crash be n there 
278	5:14:43	5:14:49	uh like 
281	5:19:0	5:19:7	ok well 
282	5:19:27	5:19:29	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
283	5:22:38	5:22:45	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
285	5:24:57	5:24:57	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
286	5:25:24	5:25:33	after the circle 
287	5:26:31	5:26:34	a little 
289	5:27:6	5:27:14	IY would say 
290	5:27:43	5:27:52	so IY go three inch straight 
292	5:28:28	5:28:36	uhm 
293	5:28:58	5:29:4	ok 
295	5:33:11	5:33:20	to the white mountain 
296	5:38:26	5:38:35	and then IY slope up 
297	5:38:47	5:38:56	four or five inch to the leave 
299	5:40:41	5:40:43	and then 
300	5:45:9	5:45:9	IY be at the plane crash 
301	5:47:1	5:47:7	uhm 
302	5:47:4	5:47:10	IY have a waterhole on map 
303	5:47:35	5:47:42	and it slope a little bit to the right 
304	5:49:19	5:49:28	ok 
305	5:49:59	5:50:5	IY be kind of go 
307	5:51:4	5:51:8	on sheet anyway 
308	5:51:1	5:51:9	and slope be about an inch long 
309	5:52:5	5:52:5	alright 
310	5:53:51	5:53:57	there  a there  
312	5:56:42	5:56:48	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain
