start
0:0:28	0:0:29	g	IY be slope 
0:1:24	0:1:27	g	just do it like this ok 
0:2:7	0:2:12	f	yeah 
0:3:33	0:3:39	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
0:4:30	0:4:39	g	no IY have 
0:5:52	0:5:58	f	ok 
0:6:9	0:6:17	g	and then 
0:7:32	0:7:35	g	uhm 
0:8:17	0:8:17	g	three inch straight across 
0:10:20	0:10:23	f	ok 
0:12:22	0:12:28	g	and then IY go 
0:13:42	0:13:48	f	ok 
0:14:40	0:14:49	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
0:16:1	0:16:1	g	uhm 
0:17:46	0:17:47	g	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
0:18:1	0:18:10	g	uhm 
0:18:18	0:18:26	f	yep 
0:20:1	0:20:9	g	so IY make circle 
0:20:25	0:20:27	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
0:21:41	0:21:42	g	and then IY be go down 
0:22:20	0:22:27	g	so anyway 
0:24:8	0:24:11	g	no IY do n have a waterhole 
0:24:37	0:24:46	g	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
0:26:42	0:26:51	g	well just 
0:27:11	0:27:20	g	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
0:27:24	0:27:25	f	and then what 
0:27:41	0:27:41	g	IY 
0:29:25	0:29:30	g	what 
0:29:42	0:29:50	g	an inch maybe a little bit less 
0:29:59	0:30:6	f	ok 
0:32:40	0:32:45	g	uhm 
0:33:38	0:33:38	g	uhm 
0:38:33	0:38:40	g	maybe IY have different thing 
0:39:25	0:39:33	g	IY just kind of slope down 
0:40:33	0:40:42	g	ok 
0:41:39	0:41:39	f	yeah 
0:41:43	0:41:46	g	have a s 
0:43:4	0:43:9	g	go up like three three and a half inch 
0:44:57	0:44:59	g	IY be go about 
0:45:26	0:45:27	g	for about two inch 
0:48:12	0:48:21	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
0:49:45	0:49:46	g	IY slope down again 
0:54:53	0:54:59	g	uhm 
0:57:29	0:57:33	g	to right 
0:58:3	0:58:6	f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
0:58:3	0:58:7	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
0:58:19	0:58:27	g	it  right next to it 
0:59:52	0:59:57	g	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
0:59:59	0:59:59	f	to the leave of the antelope 
1:0:49	1:0:55	f	ok 
1:1:52	1:1:56	g	around the bottom of it 
1:4:45	1:4:45	g	uhm 
1:7:31	1:7:32	g	IY would say 
1:8:13	1:8:17	g	ok 
1:10:5	1:10:6	f	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
1:12:47	1:12:48	g	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
1:13:13	1:13:14	f	elephant 
1:13:31	1:13:31	g	alright 
1:14:32	1:14:35	g	ok 
1:14:58	1:14:58	f	IY know IY have different thing so 
1:15:17	1:15:22	g	uhm 
1:15:34	1:15:39	g	a little bit too 
1:15:34	1:15:41	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
1:20:56	1:21:1	g	uhm and there be a stony desert 
1:21:53	1:21:53	f	ok 
1:22:36	1:22:36	g	ok 
1:22:48	1:22:51	g	a quarter of an inch 
1:23:41	1:23:44	g	but 
1:24:56	1:25:3	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
1:25:48	1:25:54	g	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
1:28:42	1:28:51	g	IY be start 
1:29:5	1:29:14	g	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
1:30:48	1:30:48	g	about like 
1:33:52	1:33:56	g	like three inch 
1:34:23	1:34:32	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
1:35:35	1:35:36	g	what 
1:37:54	1:38:3	f	ok 
1:38:9	1:38:12	g	uhm 
1:38:36	1:38:44	g	four or five inch to the leave 
1:38:56	1:39:5	f	IY have a plane crash though 
1:40:11	1:40:16	g	maybe like 
1:41:44	1:41:47	f	ok 
1:42:32	1:42:36	g	uhm 
1:42:35	1:42:44	g	and IY just go straight up 
1:43:11	1:43:15	f	ok 
1:44:2	1:44:10	g	a little 
1:45:22	1:45:28	g	well 
1:46:36	1:46:43	f	yeah IY see 
1:47:40	1:47:41	g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
1:47:49	1:47:58	g	ok 
1:48:21	1:48:29	g	it  not a big curve 
1:49:23	1:49:29	g	and then IY be 
1:53:29	1:53:37	g	and then 
1:53:49	1:53:54	f	ok 
1:55:50	1:55:56	f	IY hit some round rock 
1:56:8	1:56:8	g	so 
1:57:19	1:57:23	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
1:57:36	1:57:42	g	IY be kind of go 
1:58:38	1:58:45	g	 about five or six inch 
2:0:54	2:0:54	g	IY be actually start like right 
2:3:13	2:3:17	g	and be to the leave 
2:3:16	2:3:19	f	mm mm 
2:3:20	2:3:28	g	couple inch IY be slope down 
2:5:8	2:5:16	g	no IY do n have any rock 
2:5:44	2:5:49	g	ok 
2:7:38	2:7:45	g	then 
2:9:59	2:10:2	g	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
2:10:28	2:10:37	g	to the lake 
2:11:25	2:11:34	g	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
2:12:29	2:12:29	g	be the plane crash 
2:13:56	2:14:5	g	ok 
2:14:36	2:14:42	g	IY get 
2:16:19	2:16:24	g	ok and then IY be go 
2:17:32	2:17:35	f	yeah 
2:18:27	2:18:32	f	but  like five six inch from where IY be now 
2:20:30	2:20:32	g	be IY 
2:22:15	2:22:17	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
2:22:57	2:23:2	g	be IY in like 
2:23:9	2:23:14	g	yes 
2:23:38	2:23:39	f	IY have plane crash IY be talk about earlier  up there 
2:23:43	2:23:50	g	and then 
2:24:29	2:24:33	g	and 
2:24:33	2:24:40	g	ok 
2:25:22	2:25:29	g	and 
2:25:38	2:25:44	f	yeah and IY go straight up 
2:26:21	2:26:27	g	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
2:26:40	2:26:40	g	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
2:26:59	2:26:59	f	to the right 
2:30:4	2:30:11	g	like 
2:30:53	2:30:56	f	ok 
2:38:47	2:38:50	g	no 
2:42:22	2:42:24	g	the 
2:44:44	2:44:44	g	IY wanna kind of curve 
2:44:42	2:44:49	g	on sheet anyway 
2:44:56	2:44:59	g	and then 
2:47:46	2:47:46	f	and curve down to the leave 
2:47:45	2:47:53	g	alright be IY start near the 
2:48:26	2:48:28	f	IY be three inch above the savannah 
2:50:53	2:50:57	g	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
2:50:54	2:50:58	g	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
2:51:9	2:51:14	g	ok IY be at the savannah 
2:51:14	2:51:20	f	ok 
2:52:13	2:52:13	g	like maybe an inch 
2:52:24	2:52:32	g	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
2:53:39	2:53:41	g	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
2:54:58	2:55:6	g	five 
2:55:32	2:55:37	f	ok 
2:55:37	2:55:41	g	to the white mountain 
2:56:44	2:56:47	f	mm hmm 
2:57:10	2:57:12	g	and IY be go straight up 
2:57:55	2:58:1	g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
2:58:4	2:58:6	g	they be there 
2:58:20	2:58:27	f	ok 
2:58:58	2:59:3	f	so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
2:59:10	2:59:10	f	no IY will go with hot spring IY have 
3:0:29	3:0:29	g	ok well 
3:2:32	3:2:35	f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
3:4:19	3:4:27	g	three inch 
3:5:19	3:5:19	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
3:6:10	3:6:11	f	to the leave 
3:7:33	3:7:37	f	ok 
3:8:7	3:8:10	f	ok wait hold on 
3:9:43	3:9:49	g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
3:11:54	3:11:56	g	ok 
3:12:44	3:12:51	g	and slope be about an inch long 
3:12:49	3:12:58	g	and 
3:13:21	3:13:21	g	IY make 
3:13:23	3:13:32	f	uhm 
3:14:25	3:14:29	g	ok 
3:14:46	3:14:46	g	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
3:15:50	3:15:56	g	for like 
3:17:12	3:17:17	g	uhm 
3:19:53	3:20:0	g	uhm 
3:19:54	3:20:1	g	and then 
3:19:59	3:20:5	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
3:20:18	3:20:20	f	ok 
3:21:55	3:21:59	f	how many inch do IY think 
3:25:18	3:25:27	g	from 
3:27:10	3:27:16	g	uhm 
3:27:55	3:27:58	f	ok 
3:28:56	3:29:4	g	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
3:29:56	3:30:4	g	no there  no elephant 
3:30:22	3:30:26	g	just a slight slope 
3:33:14	3:33:18	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
3:34:48	3:34:49	f	mm hmm 
3:35:10	3:35:14	f	ok 
3:36:16	3:36:16	g	and IY be go 
3:36:37	3:36:38	g	uhm 
3:36:44	3:36:51	g	alright alright well just 
3:37:26	3:37:33	g	and then IY slope up 
3:38:24	3:38:29	f	IY be start yeah the stony desert 
3:38:35	3:38:43	g	after IY slope down IY will say 
3:38:43	3:38:47	g	and then IY you go up 
3:41:13	3:41:20	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
3:42:7	3:42:15	f	ok 
3:44:15	3:44:23	g	ok 
3:44:23	3:44:29	f	ok 
3:45:8	3:45:13	g	yes IY be go towards the lake 
3:46:27	3:46:30	f	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
3:48:54	3:48:56	g	and there  a plane crash 
3:48:52	3:48:58	g	ok 
3:50:21	3:50:23	g	no 
3:51:29	3:51:33	f	mm hmm 
3:54:31	3:54:32	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
3:54:37	3:54:41	g	and 
3:58:8	3:58:15	g	and then 
3:58:43	3:58:52	g	ok 
3:59:8	3:59:15	g	after the circle 
3:59:20	3:59:25	g	and then IY will come to a savannah 
4:2:1	4:2:1	g	ok 
4:5:42	4:5:43	f	ok 
4:6:34	4:6:36	g	maybe 
4:7:46	4:7:54	g	like IY be slope 
4:9:14	4:9:19	g	not right at the stony desert 
4:9:48	4:9:54	g	ok 
4:11:59	4:12:6	g	straight up 
4:13:11	4:13:20	g	 little slope 
4:13:34	4:13:39	g	IY do n know 
4:15:21	4:15:28	g	there  a there  
4:16:24	4:16:27	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
4:18:18	4:18:25	g	do IY have roman bath 
4:19:17	4:19:22	f	and 
4:20:5	4:20:10	f	yeah 
4:21:24	4:21:29	g	maybe four inch on the paper 
4:24:15	4:24:19	g	ok 
4:24:40	4:24:40	f	and there  a collapse shelter 
4:25:0	4:25:8	g	and then 
4:25:24	4:25:33	g	ok 
4:25:41	4:25:50	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
4:29:56	4:29:59	g	couple mile or something 
4:31:31	4:31:39	g	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
4:31:46	4:31:51	f	IY have to back up a little bit 
4:32:8	4:32:16	g	ok 
4:32:42	4:32:51	g	alright 
4:33:36	4:33:42	f	ok 
4:33:35	4:33:44	g	uhm 
4:35:8	4:35:14	g	plane crash 
4:35:17	4:35:26	f	ok 
4:36:5	4:36:13	g	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
4:36:31	4:36:34	g	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
4:36:59	4:37:7	f	IY go to a lake 
4:37:16	4:37:20	g	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
4:39:40	4:39:43	g	IY move to the leave 
4:41:28	4:41:28	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
4:46:18	4:46:27	g	like an inch 
4:48:9	4:48:15	g	kind of across from stony desert 
4:49:33	4:49:40	g	so IY be at the hot spring 
4:50:55	4:51:2	g	ok 
4:52:49	4:52:58	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
4:52:53	4:53:0	g	and then IY slope 
4:53:24	4:53:31	g	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
4:53:50	4:53:54	g	and IY be slope to the leave 
4:55:15	4:55:15	f	plane crash IY do n think be yeah 
4:55:39	4:55:39	g	so  about IY would say 
4:56:30	4:56:37	g	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
4:57:29	4:57:36	f	yeah 
4:57:38	4:57:42	g	uhm IY straighten out slope 
4:59:8	4:59:12	g	well 
4:59:11	4:59:20	f	ok 
5:1:11	5:1:19	g	ok 
5:1:58	5:1:58	f	yeah 
5:1:54	5:2:2	f	IY be at the savannah 
5:2:24	5:2:26	g	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
5:4:10	5:4:10	g	slight 
5:4:8	5:4:15	g	ok plane crash be n there 
5:5:33	5:5:34	g	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
5:7:40	5:7:46	g	like 
5:9:36	5:9:37	g	to the leave 
5:9:57	5:10:1	g	ok 
5:10:30	5:10:39	g	to the leave 
5:11:39	5:11:39	g	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
5:15:42	5:15:44	f	nope 
5:19:56	5:20:5	g	uhm 
5:20:23	5:20:26	g	like four or five inch to the leave 
5:20:41	5:20:45	g	IY be go like 
5:22:29	5:22:35	g	and then 
5:22:53	5:22:57	g	yes 
5:24:22	5:24:31	g	hmm 
5:24:39	5:24:39	f	mm hmm 
5:25:28	5:25:34	g	for like 
5:25:39	5:25:40	f	ok 
5:26:5	5:26:10	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
5:26:25	5:26:32	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
5:28:22	5:28:29	g	so IY go three inch straight 
5:29:32	5:29:35	f	so wait 
5:31:20	5:31:20	g	IY be just go down 
5:35:13	5:35:18	g	IY have a waterhole on map 
5:36:22	5:36:23	g	ok 
5:36:31	5:36:37	g	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
5:36:58	5:37:5	g	be IY anywhere near there 
5:38:47	5:38:50	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
5:40:46	5:40:48	g	three inch 
5:41:16	5:41:24	g	like 
5:41:29	5:41:31	g	ok 
5:43:45	5:43:51	g	probably the same thing 
5:44:59	5:45:4	f	mm hmm 
5:45:47	5:45:54	g	maybe like 
5:45:47	5:45:55	g	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
5:46:21	5:46:26	g	ok 
5:46:25	5:46:27	g	be IY in like almost the top of the 
5:46:38	5:46:40	g	uh like 
5:47:56	5:47:56	g	ok well 
5:48:1	5:48:5	g	and then IY slope down to the leave 
5:49:56	5:49:56	g	to the leave 
5:50:34	5:50:43	f	IY hit some rock though
