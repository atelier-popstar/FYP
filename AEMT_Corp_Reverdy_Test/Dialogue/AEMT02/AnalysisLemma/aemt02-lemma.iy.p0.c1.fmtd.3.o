start
0:0:18	0:0:23	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
0:1:8	0:1:9	g	IY just kind of slope down 
0:3:59	0:4:3	f	ok 
0:6:1	0:6:2	g	maybe 
0:6:54	0:6:57	f	IY be start yeah the stony desert 
0:6:55	0:6:58	f	ok 
0:10:20	0:10:21	f	yeah 
0:10:41	0:10:41	g	ok 
0:11:19	0:11:19	g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
0:11:32	0:11:40	g	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
0:11:38	0:11:41	g	IY have a waterhole on map 
0:13:33	0:13:33	f	ok 
0:14:27	0:14:35	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
0:14:45	0:14:45	f	ok wait hold on 
0:15:23	0:15:28	g	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
0:16:31	0:16:33	f	IY have a plane crash though 
0:18:56	0:19:2	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
0:19:5	0:19:7	f	to the leave of the antelope 
0:24:14	0:24:15	f	ok 
0:24:13	0:24:22	f	ok 
0:24:20	0:24:23	g	and slope be about an inch long 
0:24:36	0:24:40	g	IY be start at the stony desert 
0:24:50	0:24:58	g	IY move to the leave 
0:26:27	0:26:31	f	to 
0:27:3	0:27:3	g	ok 
0:28:47	0:28:48	f	to the leave 
0:29:9	0:29:10	f	and 
0:29:26	0:29:35	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
0:29:48	0:29:54	g	after plane crash 
0:34:5	0:34:13	g	hmm 
0:37:25	0:37:25	g	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
0:37:47	0:37:48	g	for like 
0:38:32	0:38:32	g	and then 
0:38:36	0:38:44	f	ok 
0:39:4	0:39:13	g	 about five or six inch 
0:40:2	0:40:9	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
0:41:2	0:41:6	f	yeah 
0:41:40	0:41:44	g	alright well IY will keep go and see 
0:41:50	0:41:57	f	IY be three inch above the savannah 
0:42:47	0:42:48	g	and IY be slope to the leave 
0:43:41	0:43:45	g	yes 
0:47:32	0:47:32	f	ok 
0:49:29	0:49:29	g	four or five inch to the leave 
0:51:46	0:51:55	g	ok 
0:52:23	0:52:32	g	it  not a big curve 
0:53:10	0:53:14	f	but  like five six inch from where IY be now 
0:54:25	0:54:31	f	ok 
0:54:51	0:54:52	g	so anyway 
0:56:24	0:56:25	f	plane crash IY do n think be yeah 
0:56:22	0:56:29	g	IY make 
0:56:32	0:56:35	g	so IY make circle 
0:56:38	0:56:40	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
0:56:39	0:56:44	g	and then IY be 
0:57:14	0:57:22	g	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
0:59:13	0:59:17	f	so wait 
0:59:57	1:0:5	f	ok 
1:0:51	1:0:54	g	from 
1:2:5	1:2:6	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
1:2:49	1:2:52	g	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
1:3:13	1:3:15	g	and then 
1:3:20	1:3:27	f	ok 
1:4:19	1:4:24	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
1:5:4	1:5:5	g	and then IY will come to a savannah 
1:8:9	1:8:16	g	for about two inch 
1:8:21	1:8:25	g	and IY be go up like 
1:14:25	1:14:28	g	and then IY you go up 
1:14:45	1:14:45	f	and curve down to the leave 
1:15:1	1:15:10	g	IY slope down again 
1:15:58	1:16:2	g	and 
1:17:29	1:17:33	g	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
1:19:8	1:19:12	g	have a s 
1:19:38	1:19:46	g	to the lake 
1:20:41	1:20:50	g	IY be kind of go 
1:21:35	1:21:43	g	ok plane crash be n there 
1:21:52	1:21:52	f	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
1:24:35	1:24:35	f	to the right 
1:27:32	1:27:39	g	slight 
1:30:41	1:30:42	g	straight up 
1:31:3	1:31:6	g	uhm 
1:32:37	1:32:44	g	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
1:32:41	1:32:48	g	kind of across from stony desert 
1:34:6	1:34:7	g	and there  a plane crash 
1:38:36	1:38:38	g	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
1:48:11	1:48:18	g	after IY go straight again 
1:49:27	1:49:29	g	and then IY slope up 
1:49:59	1:49:59	g	IY be go like 
1:53:7	1:53:11	g	ok 
1:53:55	1:53:58	f	ok 
1:54:13	1:54:17	g	well just 
1:55:42	1:55:48	g	ok 
1:57:9	1:57:14	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
1:57:48	1:57:51	g	be IY in like almost the top of the 
2:1:52	2:1:58	g	three inch straight across 
2:2:39	2:2:45	f	up tp the right 
2:3:22	2:3:25	g	ok 
2:4:55	2:4:58	g	ok 
2:5:29	2:5:36	g	three inch

2:17:47	2:17:52	g	ok 
2:19:53	2:19:55	g	a quarter of an inch 
2:20:22	2:20:31	g	IY be actually start like right 
2:20:42	2:20:49	g	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
2:20:47	2:20:53	g	ok 
2:21:15	2:21:19	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
2:21:38	2:21:45	f	and then what 
2:21:55	2:21:55	f	ok 
2:22:28	2:22:37	g	and then

2:25:55	2:26:3	g	and then 
2:27:15	2:27:16	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
2:28:25	2:28:32	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
2:29:4	2:29:11	g	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
2:29:19	2:29:24	g	the slate mountain be towards the right 
2:29:17	2:29:25	g	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
2:32:12	2:32:13	g	and  where the plane crash be 
2:33:55	2:34:2	g	uhm 
2:34:12	2:34:12	g	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
2:35:10	2:35:16	g	 little slope 
2:36:12	2:36:13	g	uhm 
2:36:13	2:36:14	g	IY be slope 
2:36:12	2:36:20	g	like four or five inch to the leave 
2:37:36	2:37:42	g	uhhh no 
2:38:53	2:38:57	g	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve

2:42:14	2:42:16	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
2:42:18	2:42:25	g	ok 
2:43:8	2:43:15	g	to the white mountain 
2:45:35	2:45:44	g	ok

2:58:24	2:58:29	g	then 
3:3:42	3:3:45	g	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
3:3:53	3:3:56	g	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
3:6:29	3:6:29	f	so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
3:6:35	3:6:41	g	ok 
3:6:43	3:6:49	g	ok well 
3:7:20	3:7:28	g	uhm

6:5:19	6:5:25	g	be IY in like 
6:5:41	6:5:45	g	IY get 
6:6:17	6:6:25	g	be the plane crash 
6:7:31	6:7:34	g	and then 
6:7:56	6:8:0	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
6:8:7	6:8:12	g	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
6:8:43	6:8:52	f	mm hmm 
6:11:34	6:11:41	g	be IY 
6:14:28	6:14:36	g	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
6:18:31	6:18:31	g	like maybe an inch 
6:18:55	6:18:58	g	like 
6:21:3	6:21:9	g	so IY be at the hot spring 
6:21:23	6:21:27	f	IY have plane crash IY be talk about earlier  up there 
6:21:59	6:22:1	g	to the leave 
6:23:28	6:23:36	f	ok 
6:23:45	6:23:45	g	no 
6:26:47	6:26:50	f	mm hmm 
6:27:11	6:27:12	g	be IY anywere near there 
6:27:51	6:27:51	g	like 
6:29:59	6:30:6	g	and then IY go straight 
6:30:18	6:30:18	g	and then IY be go down 
6:30:20	6:30:29	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
6:30:51	6:30:56	g	and IY be go straight up 
6:30:47	6:30:56	g	ok 
6:31:58	6:32:1	g	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
6:32:26	6:32:31	g	uhm 
6:32:38	6:32:41	f	ok 
6:33:7	6:33:12	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
6:33:32	6:33:40	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
6:33:47	6:33:48	g	ok 
6:33:53	6:33:56	g	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
6:34:59	6:35:2	f	yeah 
6:36:53	6:37:1	f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
6:38:55	6:38:57	g	and then 
6:38:55	6:39:0	f	ok 
6:42:20	6:42:26	g	after IY slope down IY will say
