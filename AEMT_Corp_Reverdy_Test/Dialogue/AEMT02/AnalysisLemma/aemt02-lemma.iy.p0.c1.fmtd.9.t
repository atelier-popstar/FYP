start
start g
0	0:0:42	0:0:51	on sheet anyway 
2	0:3:30	0:3:30	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
3	0:3:45	0:3:46	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
4	0:4:15	0:4:24	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
6	0:7:52	0:7:55	like 
7	0:7:52	0:7:59	and 
8	0:8:42	0:8:50	maybe like 
9	0:8:49	0:8:55	for like 
10	0:9:4	0:9:12	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
11	0:9:9	0:9:18	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
12	0:10:0	0:10:7	IY go straight down 
14	0:12:21	0:12:22	slight 
16	0:12:49	0:12:54	and IY be slope to the leave 
17	0:13:0	0:13:0	to the lake 
19	0:14:10	0:14:17	from 
21	0:18:29	0:18:30	well alright 
22	0:20:37	0:20:37	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
24	0:21:45	0:21:54	ok 
25	0:23:25	0:23:34	three inch 
27	0:25:55	0:26:3	like 
28	0:26:39	0:26:44	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
29	0:27:35	0:27:36	uhm 
30	0:33:1	0:33:4	to the leave 
31	0:34:2	0:34:2	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
32	0:38:55	0:38:58	and then IY slope up 
33	0:39:13	0:39:16	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
35	0:41:22	0:41:31	ok 
36	0:41:54	0:41:54	it  right next to it 
39	0:46:15	0:46:18	uhm IY straighten out slope 
41	0:47:2	0:47:10	IY be start at the stony desert 
43	0:47:12	0:47:15	so anyway 
44	0:47:13	0:47:20	be IY anywhere near there 
45	0:48:37	0:48:41	a quarter of an inch 
46	0:48:56	0:49:4	do IY have roman bath 
50	0:52:13	0:52:17	uhm 
51	0:52:26	0:52:34	IY be actually start like right 
52	0:53:0	0:53:4	not right at the stony desert 
53	0:53:0	0:53:6	to the white mountain 
54	0:53:23	0:53:27	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
55	0:53:30	0:53:36	ok 
56	0:53:39	0:53:42	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
58	0:56:19	0:56:24	like IY be slope 
59	0:58:50	0:58:54	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
60	0:59:42	0:59:47	ok 
61	1:0:3	1:0:6	ok 
62	1:0:31	1:0:33	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
64	1:1:48	1:1:52	after the circle 
65	1:2:35	1:2:40	no 
66	1:5:9	1:5:10	be IY 
67	1:5:36	1:5:40	IY be just go down 
69	1:7:43	1:7:48	like three inch 
70	1:8:49	1:8:54	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
72	1:9:35	1:9:44	three inch straight across 
73	1:10:30	1:10:31	uhm 
74	1:10:46	1:10:48	ok well 
75	1:10:54	1:10:57	and slope be about an inch long 
77	1:11:35	1:11:37	away about like four inch four or five inch 
78	1:13:7	1:13:14	have a s 
80	1:15:28	1:15:30	about like 
81	1:15:53	1:15:57	and then 
82	1:19:16	1:19:17	ok 
83	1:20:11	1:20:17	no IY do n have a waterhole 
85	1:22:36	1:22:39	and then 
86	1:22:57	1:23:2	ok 
87	1:24:0	1:24:9	and be to the leave 
91	1:28:7	1:28:11	IY do n know 
93	1:30:48	1:30:50	IY wanna kind of curve 
94	1:32:33	1:32:40	and 
96	1:32:50	1:32:51	and then IY slope 
98	1:39:14	1:39:19	like maybe an inch 
99	1:40:39	1:40:46	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
101	1:44:58	1:45:3	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
102	1:45:7	1:45:12	like four or five inch to the leave 
104	1:46:25	1:46:30	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
105	1:50:8	1:50:14	 little slope 
106	1:54:17	1:54:24	alright be IY start near the 
108	1:59:43	1:59:44	ok 
109	2:0:7	2:0:15	and IY should have a straight line there 
110	2:0:17	2:0:21	IY be kind of go 
111	2:0:24	2:0:32	uh like 
112	2:1:44	2:1:51	IY slope down again

114	2:4:8	2:4:15	ok 
116	2:5:32	2:5:36	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
118	2:6:46	2:6:51	alright well IY will keep go and see 
119	2:7:31	2:7:38	it  like a slight little upwards to the right

128	2:15:4	2:15:11	uhm 
130	2:17:13	2:17:14	uhm and there be a stony desert 
131	2:17:42	2:17:42	be IY in like almost the top of the 
133	2:20:54	2:21:2	around the bottom of it 
134	2:27:53	2:27:57	and then 
135	2:28:16	2:28:19	uhm 
136	2:30:38	2:30:44	straight up 
138	2:35:34	2:35:34	and IY be go straight up 
139	2:35:37	2:35:43	no IY have 
140	2:37:51	2:37:51	so 
142	2:40:16	2:40:20	yes

148	2:46:29	2:46:38	just do it like this ok 
151	2:53:28	2:53:34	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
152	2:54:33	2:54:38	and then IY slope down to the leave 
153	2:58:13	2:58:19	they be there 
155	2:58:22	2:58:27	kind of across from stony desert 
156	2:58:41	2:58:44	to right 
157	3:0:35	3:0:38	no 
158	3:1:26	3:1:35	ok 
159	3:4:36	3:4:43	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
160	3:5:35	3:5:40	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
161	3:6:6	3:6:11	uhm 
162	3:8:44	3:8:47	and then 
164	3:12:24	3:12:31	there  a there  
165	3:13:0	3:13:3	IY be start 
168	3:16:10	3:16:19	and there  a plane crash 
169	3:16:37	3:16:37	uhm 
170	3:17:27	3:17:36	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
171	3:17:57	3:18:0	and then IY will come to a savannah 
172	3:18:27	3:18:36	ok 
175	3:22:10	3:22:18	be the plane crash 
176	3:22:43	3:22:45	ok 
178	3:25:4	3:25:13	and then IY be 
179	3:26:2	3:26:8	 about five or six inch 
180	3:29:48	3:29:54	so IY make circle 
181	3:30:55	3:30:56	IY would say 
182	3:31:16	3:31:19	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
184	3:31:34	3:31:37	uhm 
186	3:33:48	3:33:55	an inch maybe a little bit less 
189	3:40:23	3:40:24	to the leave 
190	3:40:55	3:41:0	and IY just go straight up 
192	3:44:55	3:44:56	after IY go straight again 
193	3:45:22	3:45:31	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
194	3:47:38	3:47:43	just a slight slope 
195	3:52:52	3:52:58	uhm 
196	3:54:2	3:54:6	ok 
197	3:54:13	3:54:14	for like

199	3:55:13	3:55:19	and 
200	3:56:36	3:56:44	and IY be go up like 
201	3:58:39	3:58:46	and it slope a little bit to the right 
202	4:1:31	4:1:36	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
204	4:4:0	4:4:2	and 
207	4:8:43	4:8:43	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
208	4:9:51	4:9:59	ok 
211	4:12:33	4:12:37	couple mile or something 
212	4:12:56	4:13:4	right next to circle should be roman bath 
213	4:14:57	4:15:2	three inch 
214	4:17:57	4:18:0	IY be at the plane crash 
215	4:18:13	4:18:14	no IY do n have any rock 
216	4:20:22	4:20:30	couple inch IY be slope down 
217	4:20:48	4:20:51	ok plane crash be n there 
219	4:22:59	4:23:5	and then 
221	4:23:23	4:23:27	uhm 
222	4:24:25	4:24:25	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
223	4:24:48	4:24:55	IY be go like 
224	4:25:45	4:25:54	ok 
225	4:28:19	4:28:21	alright 
227	4:29:10	4:29:15	ok 
228	4:29:16	4:29:24	after IY slope down IY will say 
230	4:30:55	4:30:57	ok 
231	4:31:4	4:31:10	ok and then IY be go 
232	4:32:6	4:32:14	to the right 
234	4:33:54	4:33:54	like 
235	4:34:39	4:34:46	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
236	4:34:50	4:34:55	uhm 
237	4:38:1	4:38:5	ok 
240	4:41:32	4:41:33	maybe like 
241	4:43:14	4:43:20	IY have a waterhole on map 
242	4:45:36	4:45:42	maybe 
244	4:45:48	4:45:52	the slate mountain be towards the right 
245	4:46:38	4:46:45	so  about IY would say 
247	4:47:45	4:47:46	what 
248	4:48:16	4:48:23	ok 
251	4:50:39	4:50:45	uhm 
253	4:53:28	4:53:31	maybe IY have different thing 
254	4:53:59	4:54:0	ok IY be at the savannah 
255	4:55:7	4:55:16	ok 
256	4:55:38	4:55:46	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
258	4:58:43	4:58:49	so IY go three inch straight 
259	4:59:10	4:59:12	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
260	5:1:40	5:1:45	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
261	5:6:16	5:6:19	yes 
262	5:9:10	5:9:17	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
263	5:9:26	5:9:35	to the leave of little path where path should be 
264	5:10:25	5:10:31	well just 
265	5:11:52	5:11:59	IY 
267	5:12:35	5:12:41	and IY be go 
268	5:13:2	5:13:11	a little 
269	5:14:55	5:15:0	so IY be at the hot spring 
271	5:15:49	5:15:50	IY make 
272	5:16:20	5:16:25	uhm 
273	5:18:58	5:18:59	and  where the plane crash be 
274	5:18:55	5:19:2	and then IY you go up 
276	5:20:42	5:20:47	what 
277	5:22:15	5:22:19	like an inch 
278	5:22:21	5:22:22	probably the same thing 
279	5:22:24	5:22:26	after plane crash 
280	5:22:23	5:22:30	ok 
282	5:24:9	5:24:17	the 
284	5:24:54	5:24:55	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
285	5:25:4	5:25:6	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
286	5:25:27	5:25:30	four or five inch to the leave 
287	5:26:34	5:26:34	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
290	5:32:40	5:32:49	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
291	5:32:49	5:32:58	uhm 
293	5:36:17	5:36:22	be IY in like 
295	5:39:4	5:39:9	IY just kind of slope down 
296	5:41:19	5:41:20	IY move to the leave 
297	5:42:19	5:42:19	yes IY be go towards the lake 
298	5:43:3	5:43:3	then 
299	5:43:6	5:43:7	for about two inch 
300	5:43:9	5:43:17	and then IY go straight 
301	5:44:12	5:44:12	ok well 
302	5:45:33	5:45:38	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
303	5:47:59	5:48:4	but 
306	5:50:7	5:50:8	five 
307	5:51:9	5:51:15	uhm 
308	5:55:55	5:56:0	IY be slope 
310	5:58:13	5:58:21	and then 
311	5:59:4	5:59:13	well 
312	6:3:21	6:3:27	maybe four inch on the paper 
313	6:5:31	6:5:35	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
314	6:5:38	6:5:41	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
315	6:7:10	6:7:18	alright alright well just 
317	6:9:14	6:9:21	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
318	6:10:4	6:10:4	plane crash 
319	6:13:43	6:13:43	it  not a big curve 
320	6:16:15	6:16:16	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
321	6:17:11	6:17:12	and then 
322	6:18:8	6:18:11	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
324	6:20:54	6:21:0	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
325	6:21:3	6:21:3	ok 
326	6:22:19	6:22:23	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
328	6:25:7	6:25:12	uhhh no 
330	6:25:54	6:25:58	a little bit too 
332	6:28:16	6:28:23	uhm

337	6:29:30	6:29:30	uhm 
339	6:31:24	6:31:33	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
341	6:34:56	6:34:59	and then IY go 
342	6:35:8	6:35:12	go up like three three and a half inch 
start f
1	0:3:21	0:3:25	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
5	0:6:3	0:6:11	yeah 
13	0:11:31	0:11:32	mm hmm 
15	0:12:15	0:12:23	ok

20	0:17:42	0:17:51	ok 
23	0:21:25	0:21:34	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
26	0:24:32	0:24:33	yeah 
34	0:39:31	0:39:31	around the lake to the top 
37	0:43:18	0:43:18	to the leave of the antelope 
38	0:45:8	0:45:13	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
40	0:46:19	0:46:26	IY hit some round rock 
42	0:47:13	0:47:13	do IY go around it 
47	0:49:29	0:49:31	no IY will go with hot spring IY have 
48	0:51:15	0:51:23	and curve down to the leave 
49	0:51:44	0:51:48	ok 
57	0:54:48	0:54:55	ok 
63	1:0:52	1:0:59	yeah

76	1:10:58	1:11:1	ok 
79	1:14:43	1:14:50	IY have to back up a little bit 
84	1:21:10	1:21:16	and to the right 
88	1:25:10	1:25:15	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
89	1:25:6	1:25:15	ok 
90	1:27:45	1:27:53	IY have a plane crash though 
92	1:28:22	1:28:24	how many inch do IY think 
95	1:32:34	1:32:43	oh 
97	1:38:57	1:39:0	nope 
100	1:42:32	1:42:36	ok 
103	1:46:0	1:46:9	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
107	1:55:36	1:55:36	around the top of the lake 
115	2:4:26	2:4:31	nope IY have a white mountain 
117	2:6:9	2:6:10	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
120	2:9:26	2:9:30	yeah

187	3:35:29	3:35:31	IY be at the savannah 
188	3:37:25	3:37:33	uhm

206	4:7:54	4:7:56	and 
209	4:10:46	4:10:51	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
210	4:12:16	4:12:22	elephant 
218	4:22:24	4:22:29	ok

243	4:45:40	4:45:44	it  not like in the same place IY be describe 
246	4:47:42	4:47:45	do IY go by the plane crash 
249	4:48:23	4:48:27	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
250	4:49:37	4:49:45	ok 
252	4:52:42	4:52:49	yeah and IY go straight up 
257	4:57:35	4:57:44	so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
266	5:12:13	5:12:21	mm hmm 
270	5:14:57	5:15:5	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
275	5:19:0	5:19:3	ok 
281	5:22:45	5:22:52	IY go to a lake 
283	5:24:46	5:24:50	ok

316	6:7:19	6:7:22	yep 
323	6:20:12	6:20:16	plane crash IY do n think be yeah 
327	6:22:41	6:22:41	ok 
329	6:25:16	6:25:21	ok 
331	6:27:41	6:27:41	but  like five six inch from where IY be now

0	0:0:42	0:0:51	on sheet anyway 
2	0:3:30	0:3:30	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
3	0:3:45	0:3:46	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
4	0:4:15	0:4:24	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
6	0:7:52	0:7:55	like 
7	0:7:52	0:7:59	and 
8	0:8:42	0:8:50	maybe like 
9	0:8:49	0:8:55	for like 
10	0:9:4	0:9:12	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
11	0:9:9	0:9:18	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
12	0:10:0	0:10:7	IY go straight down 
14	0:12:21	0:12:22	slight 
16	0:12:49	0:12:54	and IY be slope to the leave 
17	0:13:0	0:13:0	to the lake 
19	0:14:10	0:14:17	from 
21	0:18:29	0:18:30	well alright 
22	0:20:37	0:20:37	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
24	0:21:45	0:21:54	ok 
25	0:23:25	0:23:34	three inch 
27	0:25:55	0:26:3	like 
28	0:26:39	0:26:44	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
29	0:27:35	0:27:36	uhm 
30	0:33:1	0:33:4	to the leave 
31	0:34:2	0:34:2	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
32	0:38:55	0:38:58	and then IY slope up 
33	0:39:13	0:39:16	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
35	0:41:22	0:41:31	ok 
36	0:41:54	0:41:54	it  right next to it 
39	0:46:15	0:46:18	uhm IY straighten out slope 
41	0:47:2	0:47:10	IY be start at the stony desert 
43	0:47:12	0:47:15	so anyway 
44	0:47:13	0:47:20	be IY anywhere near there 
45	0:48:37	0:48:41	a quarter of an inch 
46	0:48:56	0:49:4	do IY have roman bath 
50	0:52:13	0:52:17	uhm 
51	0:52:26	0:52:34	IY be actually start like right 
52	0:53:0	0:53:4	not right at the stony desert 
53	0:53:0	0:53:6	to the white mountain 
54	0:53:23	0:53:27	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
55	0:53:30	0:53:36	ok 
56	0:53:39	0:53:42	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
58	0:56:19	0:56:24	like IY be slope 
59	0:58:50	0:58:54	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there

61	1:0:3	1:0:6	ok 
62	1:0:31	1:0:33	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
64	1:1:48	1:1:52	after the circle 
65	1:2:35	1:2:40	no 
66	1:5:9	1:5:10	be IY 
67	1:5:36	1:5:40	IY be just go down 
69	1:7:43	1:7:48	like three inch 
70	1:8:49	1:8:54	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
72	1:9:35	1:9:44	three inch straight across 
73	1:10:30	1:10:31	uhm 
74	1:10:46	1:10:48	ok well 
75	1:10:54	1:10:57	and slope be about an inch long 
77	1:11:35	1:11:37	away about like four inch four or five inch 
78	1:13:7	1:13:14	have a s 
80	1:15:28	1:15:30	about like

94	1:32:33	1:32:40	and 
96	1:32:50	1:32:51	and then IY slope 
98	1:39:14	1:39:19	like maybe an inch 
99	1:40:39	1:40:46	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
101	1:44:58	1:45:3	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
102	1:45:7	1:45:12	like four or five inch to the leave 
104	1:46:25	1:46:30	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
105	1:50:8	1:50:14	 little slope

128	2:15:4	2:15:11	uhm 
130	2:17:13	2:17:14	uhm and there be a stony desert 
131	2:17:42	2:17:42	be IY in like almost the top of the 
133	2:20:54	2:21:2	around the bottom of it 
134	2:27:53	2:27:57	and then 
135	2:28:16	2:28:19	uhm

148	2:46:29	2:46:38	just do it like this ok 
151	2:53:28	2:53:34	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
152	2:54:33	2:54:38	and then IY slope down to the leave 
153	2:58:13	2:58:19	they be there 
155	2:58:22	2:58:27	kind of across from stony desert 
156	2:58:41	2:58:44	to right 
157	3:0:35	3:0:38	no 
158	3:1:26	3:1:35	ok 
159	3:4:36	3:4:43	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it

161	3:6:6	3:6:11	uhm 
162	3:8:44	3:8:47	and then 
164	3:12:24	3:12:31	there  a there  
165	3:13:0	3:13:3	IY be start 
168	3:16:10	3:16:19	and there  a plane crash 
169	3:16:37	3:16:37	uhm 
170	3:17:27	3:17:36	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
171	3:17:57	3:18:0	and then IY will come to a savannah 
172	3:18:27	3:18:36	ok 
175	3:22:10	3:22:18	be the plane crash 
176	3:22:43	3:22:45	ok 
178	3:25:4	3:25:13	and then IY be 
179	3:26:2	3:26:8	 about five or six inch 
180	3:29:48	3:29:54	so IY make circle 
181	3:30:55	3:30:56	IY would say 
182	3:31:16	3:31:19	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
184	3:31:34	3:31:37	uhm 
186	3:33:48	3:33:55	an inch maybe a little bit less 
189	3:40:23	3:40:24	to the leave 
190	3:40:55	3:41:0	and IY just go straight up 
192	3:44:55	3:44:56	after IY go straight again 
193	3:45:22	3:45:31	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
194	3:47:38	3:47:43	just a slight slope 
195	3:52:52	3:52:58	uhm 
196	3:54:2	3:54:6	ok

200	3:56:36	3:56:44	and IY be go up like 
201	3:58:39	3:58:46	and it slope a little bit to the right 
202	4:1:31	4:1:36	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
204	4:4:0	4:4:2	and 
207	4:8:43	4:8:43	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
208	4:9:51	4:9:59	ok 
211	4:12:33	4:12:37	couple mile or something 
212	4:12:56	4:13:4	right next to circle should be roman bath 
213	4:14:57	4:15:2	three inch 
214	4:17:57	4:18:0	IY be at the plane crash 
215	4:18:13	4:18:14	no IY do n have any rock 
216	4:20:22	4:20:30	couple inch IY be slope down 
217	4:20:48	4:20:51	ok plane crash be n there 
219	4:22:59	4:23:5	and then 
221	4:23:23	4:23:27	uhm 
222	4:24:25	4:24:25	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
223	4:24:48	4:24:55	IY be go like 
224	4:25:45	4:25:54	ok 
225	4:28:19	4:28:21	alright 
227	4:29:10	4:29:15	ok 
228	4:29:16	4:29:24	after IY slope down IY will say 
230	4:30:55	4:30:57	ok 
231	4:31:4	4:31:10	ok and then IY be go 
232	4:32:6	4:32:14	to the right 
234	4:33:54	4:33:54	like 
235	4:34:39	4:34:46	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
236	4:34:50	4:34:55	uhm 
237	4:38:1	4:38:5	ok 
240	4:41:32	4:41:33	maybe like 
241	4:43:14	4:43:20	IY have a waterhole on map 
242	4:45:36	4:45:42	maybe 
244	4:45:48	4:45:52	the slate mountain be towards the right 
245	4:46:38	4:46:45	so  about IY would say 
247	4:47:45	4:47:46	what 
248	4:48:16	4:48:23	ok 
251	4:50:39	4:50:45	uhm 
253	4:53:28	4:53:31	maybe IY have different thing 
254	4:53:59	4:54:0	ok IY be at the savannah 
255	4:55:7	4:55:16	ok 
256	4:55:38	4:55:46	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
258	4:58:43	4:58:49	so IY go three inch straight 
259	4:59:10	4:59:12	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
260	5:1:40	5:1:45	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
261	5:6:16	5:6:19	yes 
262	5:9:10	5:9:17	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
263	5:9:26	5:9:35	to the leave of little path where path should be 
264	5:10:25	5:10:31	well just 
265	5:11:52	5:11:59	IY 
267	5:12:35	5:12:41	and IY be go 
268	5:13:2	5:13:11	a little 
269	5:14:55	5:15:0	so IY be at the hot spring 
271	5:15:49	5:15:50	IY make 
272	5:16:20	5:16:25	uhm 
273	5:18:58	5:18:59	and  where the plane crash be 
274	5:18:55	5:19:2	and then IY you go up 
276	5:20:42	5:20:47	what 
277	5:22:15	5:22:19	like an inch 
278	5:22:21	5:22:22	probably the same thing 
279	5:22:24	5:22:26	after plane crash 
280	5:22:23	5:22:30	ok 
282	5:24:9	5:24:17	the 
284	5:24:54	5:24:55	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
285	5:25:4	5:25:6	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
286	5:25:27	5:25:30	four or five inch to the leave 
287	5:26:34	5:26:34	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
290	5:32:40	5:32:49	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
291	5:32:49	5:32:58	uhm 
293	5:36:17	5:36:22	be IY in like 
295	5:39:4	5:39:9	IY just kind of slope down 
296	5:41:19	5:41:20	IY move to the leave 
297	5:42:19	5:42:19	yes IY be go towards the lake 
298	5:43:3	5:43:3	then 
299	5:43:6	5:43:7	for about two inch 
300	5:43:9	5:43:17	and then IY go straight 
301	5:44:12	5:44:12	ok well 
302	5:45:33	5:45:38	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
303	5:47:59	5:48:4	but 
306	5:50:7	5:50:8	five 
307	5:51:9	5:51:15	uhm 
308	5:55:55	5:56:0	IY be slope 
310	5:58:13	5:58:21	and then 
311	5:59:4	5:59:13	well 
312	6:3:21	6:3:27	maybe four inch on the paper
