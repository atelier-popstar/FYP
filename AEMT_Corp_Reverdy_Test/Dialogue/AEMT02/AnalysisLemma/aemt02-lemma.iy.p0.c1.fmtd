01:01:01	1:1:4	f					ok 
1:1:4	1:1:14	g					ok 
1:1:14	1:2:38	g					IY be start 
1:2:38	1:4:3	g					uhm and there be a stony desert 
1:4:3	1:5:30	g					IY be actually start like right 
1:5:30	1:6:36	g					uhm 
1:6:36	1:7:12	g					kind of across from stony desert 
1:7:12	1:7:49	g					and 
1:7:49	1:9:16	g					IY be kind of go 
1:9:16	1:10:21	g					IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
1:10:21	1:11:58	g					and IY be go 
1:11:58	1:11:58	g					IY would say 
1:11:58	1:13:13	g					maybe 
1:13:13	1:14:48	g					couple mile or something 
1:14:48	1:16:24	g					from 
1:16:24	1:18:18	g					uhm 
1:18:18	1:19:54	g					where IY be go down to a plane crash 
1:19:54	1:20:28	g					uhm 
1:20:28	1:20:47	g					there  a there  
1:20:47	1:21:7	f					ok wait hold on 
1:21:7	1:21:27	g					ok 
1:21:27	1:23:13	f					IY have to back up a little bit 
1:23:13	1:24:43	g					ok 
1:24:43	1:26:21	g					so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
1:26:21	1:26:32	f					ok 
1:26:32	1:27:30	g					and IY go to the leave a little bit 
1:27:30	1:29:27	g					and then 
1:29:27	1:31:2	g					uhm 
1:31:2	1:31:57	g					IY just kind of slope down 
1:31:57	1:33:3	g					a little bit too 
1:33:3	1:35:1	g					and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
1:35:1	1:36:42	g					after IY slope down IY will say 
1:36:42	1:37:23	g					like 
1:37:23	1:38:36	g					maybe like 
1:38:36	1:39:45	g					couple inch IY be slope down 
1:39:45	1:40:4	g					and then IY go straight 
1:40:4	1:41:12	g					for like 
1:41:12	1:42:38	g					like 
1:42:38	1:43:7	g					five 
1:43:7	1:44:52	g					maybe four inch on the paper 
1:44:52	1:46:41	g					and there  a plane crash 
1:46:41	1:47:3	f					uhm 
1:47:3	1:47:22	f					uh IY do n know know what to say 
1:47:22	1:49:2	f					plane crash IY do n think be yeah 
1:49:2	1:51:1	f					it  not like in the same place IY be describe 
1:51:1	1:51:8	g					plane crash 
1:51:8	1:52:54	f					mm mm 
1:52:54	1:54:39	g					uhm 
1:54:39	1:56:10	g					alright be IY start near the 
1:56:10	1:57:50	f					IY be start yeah the stony desert 
1:57:50	1:58:49	g					be IY 
1:58:49	2:0:15	g					IY be start at the stony desert 
2:0:15	2:1:27	f					yeah 
2:1:27	2:2:43	g					ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
2:2:43	2:2:45	f					and 
2:2:45	2:3:0	g					like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
2:3:0	2:4:49	g					not right at the stony desert 
2:4:49	2:6:20	f					yeah 
2:6:20	2:7:7	g					ok and then IY be go 
2:7:7	2:8:6	f					ok 
2:8:6	2:8:22	g					to the leave 
2:8:22	2:8:52	g					like an inch 
2:8:52	2:9:33	g					and then IY be go down 
2:9:33	2:10:23	g					like maybe an inch 
2:10:23	2:11:16	g					 little slope 
2:11:16	2:11:26	f					ok 
2:11:26	2:12:7	g					and then IY go 
2:12:7	2:14:6	g					like four or five inch to the leave 
2:14:6	2:15:36	g					and  where the plane crash be 
2:15:36	2:16:54	g					be IY anywhere near there 
2:16:54	2:17:28	f					plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
2:17:28	2:17:55	f					so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
2:17:55	2:19:7	g					four or five inch to the leave 
2:19:7	2:19:19	f					ok 
2:19:19	2:19:26	g					and then 
2:19:26	2:20:37	g					after plane crash 
2:20:37	2:22:17	f					be IY suppose to start at the same place 
2:22:17	2:23:6	f					ok 
2:23:6	2:24:3	g					ok plane crash be n there 
2:24:3	2:25:11	g					uhm 
2:25:11	2:25:42	g					alright well IY will keep go and see 
2:25:42	2:26:2	g					alright 
2:26:2	2:27:21	g					so 
2:27:21	2:27:33	g					uhm 
2:27:33	2:28:23	g					IY be at the plane crash 
2:28:23	2:29:22	g					and 
2:29:22	2:29:56	g					IY wanna kind of curve 
2:29:56	2:30:21	g					a little 
2:30:21	2:31:28	g					to the leave 
2:31:28	2:31:28	g					and then IY you go up 
2:31:28	2:32:58	g					and IY be go up like 
2:32:58	2:33:33	g					three inch 
2:33:33	2:33:53	f					mm hmm 
2:33:53	2:35:37	g					and 
2:35:37	2:35:51	g					in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
2:35:51	2:36:0	g					it  not a big curve 
2:36:0	2:37:25	f					ok 
2:37:25	2:39:2	g					ok 
2:39:2	2:39:23	g					and then 
2:39:23	2:40:59	g					uhm 
2:40:59	2:42:34	g					after IY go straight again 
2:42:34	2:44:28	g					away about like four inch four or five inch 
2:44:28	2:46:4	g					and IY come to a collapse shelter 
2:46:4	2:46:22	g					be IY anywere near there 
2:46:22	2:47:25	f					yeah IY see 
2:47:25	2:48:55	g					ok 
2:48:55	2:50:25	f					so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
2:50:25	2:51:31	g					yes 
2:51:31	2:52:13	f					and there  a collapse shelter 
2:52:13	2:53:51	g					yes 
2:53:51	2:54:3	f					ok 
2:54:3	2:55:40	g					ok 
2:55:40	2:56:6	g					now IY be at the collapse shelter 
2:56:6	2:57:58	g					and IY go down IY slope to the right 
2:57:58	2:58:33	g					just a slight slope 
2:58:33	3:0:21	g					about like 
3:0:21	3:0:48	g					an inch maybe a little bit less 
3:0:48	3:1:13	f					to the right 
3:1:13	3:2:59	g					to the right 
3:2:59	3:3:12	g					IY be slope 
3:3:12	3:3:40	f					ok 
3:3:40	3:4:36	f					and then what 
3:4:36	3:5:15	g					ok 
3:5:15	3:7:9	g					and then 
3:7:9	3:7:56	g					IY 
3:7:56	3:9:32	g					have a s 
3:9:32	3:11:23	g					IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
3:11:23	3:12:51	g					it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
3:12:51	3:14:47	f					mm hmm 
3:14:47	3:15:39	g					slight 
3:15:39	3:16:45	g					uhm 
3:16:45	3:17:37	g					and then IY will come to a savannah 
3:17:37	3:18:42	f					ok 
3:18:42	3:20:37	g					ok 
3:20:37	3:22:16	f					so IY pass a waterhole or no 
3:22:16	3:23:20	g					uhhh no 
3:23:20	3:25:10	g					no IY do n have a waterhole 
3:25:10	3:26:33	g					IY have a waterhole on map 
3:26:33	3:26:58	f					yeah 
3:26:58	3:27:34	g					well 
3:27:34	3:27:52	g					alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
3:27:52	3:28:27	f					yeah 
3:28:27	3:29:12	g					ok 
3:29:12	3:30:32	f					IY be at the savannah 
3:30:32	3:32:30	g					ok IY be at the savannah 
3:32:30	3:32:33	g					now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
3:32:33	3:32:52	g					like 
3:32:52	3:34:36	g					three inch 
3:34:36	3:35:55	f					ok 
3:35:55	3:37:9	g					and IY be go straight up 
3:37:9	3:38:26	g					and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
3:38:26	3:39:1	f					nope IY have a white mountain 
3:39:1	3:40:56	g					ok well 
3:40:56	3:41:0	g					probably the same thing 
3:41:0	3:42:27	f					but  like five six inch from where IY be now 
3:42:27	3:42:47	f					to the leave 
3:42:47	3:44:39	g					where be IY right now start at the savannah 
3:44:39	3:45:32	f					yeah and IY go straight up 
3:45:32	3:47:29	g					straight up 
3:47:29	3:48:18	f					and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
3:48:18	3:49:4	g					hmm 
3:49:4	3:49:23	g					well 
3:49:23	3:50:53	g					IY do n know 
3:50:53	3:50:57	g					alright 
3:50:57	3:51:32	g					well just 
3:51:32	3:51:44	f					be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
3:51:44	3:52:54	g					oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
3:52:54	3:53:18	g					the slate mountain be towards the right 
3:53:18	3:53:18	g					the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
3:53:18	3:54:59	g					be IY in like 
3:54:59	3:55:57	g					be IY in like almost the top of the 
3:55:57	3:56:35	f					IY be three inch above the savannah 
3:56:35	3:56:43	g					no IY have 
3:56:43	3:58:15	g					maybe IY have different thing 
3:58:15	3:59:13	g					well alright 
3:59:13	4:0:54	f					IY know IY have different thing so 
4:0:54	4:2:42	g					alright alright well just 
4:2:42	4:2:55	g					just do it like this ok 
4:2:55	4:4:29	g					go up like three three and a half inch 
4:4:29	4:5:26	f					and curve down to the leave 
4:5:26	4:6:53	g					and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
4:6:53	4:8:37	f					curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
4:8:37	4:9:28	g					it  right next to it 
4:9:28	4:11:4	g					it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
4:11:4	4:12:8	f					how many inch do IY think 
4:12:8	4:12:49	g					maybe like 
4:12:49	4:14:10	g					a quarter of an inch 
4:14:10	4:15:44	g					to the leave of little path where path should be 
4:15:44	4:17:37	f					oh 
4:17:37	4:18:41	f					ok 
4:18:41	4:20:15	g					ok 
4:20:15	4:20:30	g					and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
4:20:30	4:20:58	g					for like 
4:20:58	4:22:22	g					maybe an inch and a half two inch 
4:22:22	4:23:0	f					yeah 
4:23:0	4:23:39	g					and then IY slope down to the leave 
4:23:39	4:25:31	g					and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
4:25:31	4:25:52	f					mm hmm 
4:25:52	4:27:8	g					ok 
4:27:8	4:28:7	g					and then 
4:28:7	4:29:56	g					as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
4:29:56	4:31:9	f					no IY will go with hot spring IY have 
4:31:9	4:31:54	g					ok 
4:31:54	4:33:41	g					so IY be at the hot spring 
4:33:41	4:34:47	g					and IY be slope to the leave 
4:34:47	4:34:50	g					and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
4:34:50	4:36:29	f					mm hmm 
4:36:29	4:36:50	g					ok 
4:36:50	4:38:25	g					and then 
4:38:25	4:38:56	g					uhm 
4:38:56	4:39:19	g					IY slope down again 
4:39:19	4:39:27	f					elephant 
4:39:27	4:40:20	g					uhm 
4:40:20	4:42:2	g					no there  no elephant 
4:42:2	4:43:6	g					on sheet anyway 
4:43:6	4:44:7	f					ok 
4:44:7	4:44:11	f					do IY hit anything when IY go down 
4:44:11	4:44:38	g					no 
4:44:38	4:45:16	g					IY be just go down 
4:45:16	4:46:31	g					like IY be slope 
4:46:31	4:47:20	g					and slope be about an inch long 
4:47:20	4:49:4	g					and be to the leave 
4:49:4	4:50:2	f					ok 
4:50:2	4:51:58	g					ok 
4:51:58	4:53:35	g					and then 
4:53:35	4:55:5	g					uhm 
4:55:5	4:56:26	g					IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
4:56:26	4:57:48	g					to the leave 
4:57:48	4:59:22	f					ok 
4:59:22	4:59:22	g					ok 
4:59:22	4:59:43	g					and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
4:59:43	5:0:13	f					to 
5:0:13	5:1:9	g					to the white mountain 
5:1:9	5:2:31	f					ok 
5:2:31	5:2:43	g					ok 
5:2:43	5:2:43	g					so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
5:2:43	5:3:37	g					and it slope a little bit to the right 
5:3:37	5:4:8	g					but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
5:4:8	5:5:9	f					ok 
5:5:9	5:6:3	g					ok 
5:6:3	5:6:3	g					so  about IY would say 
5:6:3	5:6:34	g					 about five or six inch 
5:6:34	5:6:55	f					mm hmm 
5:6:55	5:6:59	g					ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
5:6:59	5:7:47	f					mm hmm 
5:7:47	5:8:25	g					uhm IY straighten out slope 
5:8:25	5:9:22	g					and IY just go straight up 
5:9:22	5:11:13	g					for about two inch 
5:11:13	5:12:14	g					ok 
5:12:14	5:13:49	f					yep 
5:13:49	5:15:25	g					then 
5:15:25	5:16:25	f					IY hit some round rock 
5:16:25	5:17:11	g					no IY do n have any rock 
5:17:11	5:18:38	f					ok 
5:18:38	5:18:40	g					ok 
5:18:40	5:20:29	f					IY hit some rock though 
5:20:29	5:20:51	g					ok 
5:20:51	5:21:16	g					uhm 
5:21:16	5:22:33	g					and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
5:22:33	5:23:38	g					and then IY slope 
5:23:38	5:24:27	g					well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
5:24:27	5:24:41	f					IY go to a lake 
5:24:41	5:26:27	g					yes IY be go towards the lake 
5:26:27	5:27:42	f					ok 
5:27:42	5:28:36	g					but 
5:28:36	5:29:54	g					IY be go about 
5:29:54	5:30:40	g					three inch straight across 
5:30:40	5:31:50	g					to the lake 
5:31:50	5:32:32	g					and then IY be 
5:32:32	5:33:47	g					IY get 
5:33:47	5:35:46	f					do IY go through anything 
5:35:46	5:36:23	g					uhm 
5:36:23	5:37:22	g					no 
5:37:22	5:39:21	g					IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
5:39:21	5:40:36	g					so IY go three inch straight 
5:40:36	5:41:36	g					and then IY slope up 
5:41:36	5:42:40	g					and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
5:42:40	5:43:0	f					around the lake to the top 
5:43:0	5:44:10	g					the 
5:44:10	5:44:27	g					what 
5:44:27	5:45:7	f					around the top of the lake 
5:45:7	5:46:52	g					yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
5:46:52	5:47:51	f					ok 
5:47:51	5:49:37	g					ok 
5:49:37	5:49:53	g					and then 
5:49:53	5:51:21	g					uhm 
5:51:21	5:53:11	g					right next to circle should be roman bath 
5:53:11	5:54:50	g					do IY have roman bath 
5:54:50	5:55:17	f					nope 
5:55:17	5:57:5	g					ok well 
5:57:5	5:57:30	g					they be there 
5:57:30	5:58:34	g					so anyway 
5:58:34	5:58:43	g					IY make 
5:58:43	6:0:27	f					IY have a plane crash though 
6:0:27	6:2:23	g					what 
6:2:23	6:2:55	f					IY have plane crash IY be talk about earlier  up there 
6:2:55	6:4:8	g					yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
6:4:8	6:4:42	g					so IY make circle 
6:4:42	6:5:31	f					ok 
6:5:31	6:6:55	f					yeah 
6:6:55	6:7:13	g					and 
6:7:13	6:8:5	g					after the circle 
6:8:5	6:9:5	g					uhm 
6:9:5	6:10:12	g					IY move to the leave 
6:10:12	6:10:58	g					so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch
