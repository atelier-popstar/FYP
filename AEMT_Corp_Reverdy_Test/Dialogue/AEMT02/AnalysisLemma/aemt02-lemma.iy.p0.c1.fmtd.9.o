start
0:0:42	0:0:51	g	on sheet anyway 
0:3:21	0:3:25	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
0:3:30	0:3:30	g	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
0:3:45	0:3:46	g	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
0:4:15	0:4:24	g	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
0:6:3	0:6:11	f	yeah 
0:7:52	0:7:55	g	like 
0:7:52	0:7:59	g	and 
0:8:42	0:8:50	g	maybe like 
0:8:49	0:8:55	g	for like 
0:9:4	0:9:12	g	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
0:9:9	0:9:18	g	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
0:10:0	0:10:7	g	IY go straight down 
0:11:31	0:11:32	f	mm hmm 
0:12:21	0:12:22	g	slight 
0:12:15	0:12:23	f	ok 
0:12:49	0:12:54	g	and IY be slope to the leave 
0:13:0	0:13:0	g	to the lake 
0:13:21	0:13:23	f	to 
0:14:10	0:14:17	g	from 
0:17:42	0:17:51	f	ok 
0:18:29	0:18:30	g	well alright 
0:20:37	0:20:37	g	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
0:21:25	0:21:34	f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
0:21:45	0:21:54	g	ok 
0:23:25	0:23:34	g	three inch 
0:24:32	0:24:33	f	yeah

0:27:35	0:27:36	g	uhm 
0:33:1	0:33:4	g	to the leave 
0:34:2	0:34:2	g	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
0:38:55	0:38:58	g	and then IY slope up 
0:39:13	0:39:16	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
0:39:31	0:39:31	f	around the lake to the top 
0:41:22	0:41:31	g	ok 
0:41:54	0:41:54	g	it  right next to it 
0:43:18	0:43:18	f	to the leave of the antelope 
0:45:8	0:45:13	f	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
0:46:15	0:46:18	g	uhm IY straighten out slope 
0:46:19	0:46:26	f	IY hit some round rock 
0:47:2	0:47:10	g	IY be start at the stony desert 
0:47:13	0:47:13	f	do IY go around it 
0:47:12	0:47:15	g	so anyway 
0:47:13	0:47:20	g	be IY anywhere near there 
0:48:37	0:48:41	g	a quarter of an inch 
0:48:56	0:49:4	g	do IY have roman bath 
0:49:29	0:49:31	f	no IY will go with hot spring IY have 
0:51:15	0:51:23	f	and curve down to the leave 
0:51:44	0:51:48	f	ok 
0:52:13	0:52:17	g	uhm 
0:52:26	0:52:34	g	IY be actually start like right 
0:53:0	0:53:4	g	not right at the stony desert 
0:53:0	0:53:6	g	to the white mountain 
0:53:23	0:53:27	g	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
0:53:30	0:53:36	g	ok 
0:53:39	0:53:42	g	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
0:54:48	0:54:55	f	ok 
0:56:19	0:56:24	g	like IY be slope 
0:58:50	0:58:54	g	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there

1:0:3	1:0:6	g	ok 
1:0:31	1:0:33	g	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
1:0:52	1:0:59	f	yeah 
1:1:48	1:1:52	g	after the circle 
1:2:35	1:2:40	g	no 
1:5:9	1:5:10	g	be IY 
1:5:36	1:5:40	g	IY be just go down 
1:6:49	1:6:52	f	IY hit some rock though 
1:7:43	1:7:48	g	like three inch 
1:8:49	1:8:54	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
1:8:58	1:8:59	f	mm hmm 
1:9:35	1:9:44	g	three inch straight across 
1:10:30	1:10:31	g	uhm 
1:10:46	1:10:48	g	ok well 
1:10:54	1:10:57	g	and slope be about an inch long 
1:10:58	1:11:1	f	ok 
1:11:35	1:11:37	g	away about like four inch four or five inch 
1:13:7	1:13:14	g	have a s

1:21:10	1:21:16	f	and to the right 
1:22:36	1:22:39	g	and then 
1:22:57	1:23:2	g	ok 
1:24:0	1:24:9	g	and be to the leave 
1:25:10	1:25:15	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
1:25:6	1:25:15	f	ok 
1:27:45	1:27:53	f	IY have a plane crash though 
1:28:7	1:28:11	g	IY do n know 
1:28:22	1:28:24	f	how many inch do IY think 
1:30:48	1:30:50	g	IY wanna kind of curve 
1:32:33	1:32:40	g	and 
1:32:34	1:32:43	f	oh 
1:32:50	1:32:51	g	and then IY slope 
1:38:57	1:39:0	f	nope 
1:39:14	1:39:19	g	like maybe an inch 
1:40:39	1:40:46	g	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
1:42:32	1:42:36	f	ok 
1:44:58	1:45:3	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
1:45:7	1:45:12	g	like four or five inch to the leave 
1:46:0	1:46:9	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
1:46:25	1:46:30	g	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
1:50:8	1:50:14	g	 little slope 
1:54:17	1:54:24	g	alright be IY start near the 
1:55:36	1:55:36	f	around the top of the lake 
1:59:43	1:59:44	g	ok 
2:0:7	2:0:15	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
2:0:17	2:0:21	g	IY be kind of go 
2:0:24	2:0:32	g	uh like 
2:1:44	2:1:51	g	IY slope down again

2:4:8	2:4:15	g	ok 
2:4:26	2:4:31	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
2:5:32	2:5:36	g	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
2:6:9	2:6:10	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
2:6:46	2:6:51	g	alright well IY will keep go and see 
2:7:31	2:7:38	g	it  like a slight little upwards to the right

2:37:51	2:37:51	g	so 
2:38:24	2:38:25	f	IY have plane crash IY be talk about earlier  up there 
2:40:16	2:40:20	g	yes 
2:40:53	2:40:54	f	mm hmm 
2:41:23	2:41:32	g	no there  no elephant

2:53:15	2:53:18	f	do IY go through anything 
2:53:28	2:53:34	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
2:54:33	2:54:38	g	and then IY slope down to the leave 
2:58:13	2:58:19	g	they be there 
2:58:21	2:58:27	f	IY know IY have different thing so 
2:58:22	2:58:27	g	kind of across from stony desert 
2:58:41	2:58:44	g	to right 
3:0:35	3:0:38	g	no 
3:1:26	3:1:35	g	ok 
3:4:36	3:4:43	g	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it

3:15:55	3:15:57	f	ok 
3:16:10	3:16:19	g	and there  a plane crash 
3:16:37	3:16:37	g	uhm 
3:17:27	3:17:36	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
3:17:57	3:18:0	g	and then IY will come to a savannah 
3:18:27	3:18:36	g	ok 
3:19:18	3:19:26	f	to the leave 
3:19:44	3:19:50	f	and then what 
3:22:10	3:22:18	g	be the plane crash 
3:22:43	3:22:45	g	ok 
3:23:39	3:23:47	f	ok 
3:25:4	3:25:13	g	and then IY be 
3:26:2	3:26:8	g	 about five or six inch 
3:29:48	3:29:54	g	so IY make circle 
3:30:55	3:30:56	g	IY would say 
3:31:16	3:31:19	g	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
3:31:35	3:31:36	f	and there  a collapse shelter 
3:31:34	3:31:37	g	uhm 
3:32:45	3:32:50	f	to the right 
3:33:48	3:33:55	g	an inch maybe a little bit less 
3:35:29	3:35:31	f	IY be at the savannah 
3:37:25	3:37:33	f	uhm 
3:40:23	3:40:24	g	to the leave 
3:40:55	3:41:0	g	and IY just go straight up 
3:43:44	3:43:52	f	up tp the right 
3:44:55	3:44:56	g	after IY go straight again 
3:45:22	3:45:31	g	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
3:47:38	3:47:43	g	just a slight slope 
3:52:52	3:52:58	g	uhm 
3:54:2	3:54:6	g	ok

3:56:36	3:56:44	g	and IY be go up like 
3:58:39	3:58:46	g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
4:1:31	4:1:36	g	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
4:3:10	4:3:13	f	IY be start yeah the stony desert 
4:4:0	4:4:2	g	and 
4:4:26	4:4:28	f	ok 
4:7:54	4:7:56	f	and 
4:8:43	4:8:43	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
4:9:51	4:9:59	g	ok 
4:10:46	4:10:51	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
4:12:16	4:12:22	f	elephant 
4:12:33	4:12:37	g	couple mile or something 
4:12:56	4:13:4	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
4:14:57	4:15:2	g	three inch 
4:17:57	4:18:0	g	IY be at the plane crash 
4:18:13	4:18:14	g	no IY do n have any rock 
4:20:22	4:20:30	g	couple inch IY be slope down 
4:20:48	4:20:51	g	ok plane crash be n there 
4:22:24	4:22:29	f	ok 
4:22:59	4:23:5	g	and then 
4:23:16	4:23:18	f	so wait 
4:23:23	4:23:27	g	uhm 
4:24:25	4:24:25	g	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
4:24:48	4:24:55	g	IY be go like 
4:25:45	4:25:54	g	ok 
4:28:19	4:28:21	g	alright

4:29:10	4:29:15	g	ok 
4:29:16	4:29:24	g	after IY slope down IY will say 
4:30:9	4:30:14	f	mm hmm 
4:30:55	4:30:57	g	ok 
4:31:4	4:31:10	g	ok and then IY be go

4:33:42	4:33:45	f	ok wait hold on 
4:33:54	4:33:54	g	like 
4:34:39	4:34:46	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
4:34:50	4:34:55	g	uhm 
4:38:1	4:38:5	g	ok 
4:39:1	4:39:5	f	IY be three inch above the savannah 
4:40:40	4:40:46	f	yeah IY see 
4:41:32	4:41:33	g	maybe like 
4:43:14	4:43:20	g	IY have a waterhole on map 
4:45:36	4:45:42	g	maybe 
4:45:40	4:45:44	f	it  not like in the same place IY be describe 
4:45:48	4:45:52	g	the slate mountain be towards the right 
4:46:38	4:46:45	g	so  about IY would say 
4:47:42	4:47:45	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
4:47:45	4:47:46	g	what 
4:48:16	4:48:23	g	ok 
4:48:23	4:48:27	f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
4:49:37	4:49:45	f	ok 
4:50:39	4:50:45	g	uhm 
4:52:42	4:52:49	f	yeah and IY go straight up 
4:53:28	4:53:31	g	maybe IY have different thing 
4:53:59	4:54:0	g	ok IY be at the savannah 
4:55:7	4:55:16	g	ok 
4:55:38	4:55:46	g	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
4:57:35	4:57:44	f	so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
4:58:43	4:58:49	g	so IY go three inch straight 
4:59:10	4:59:12	g	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
5:1:40	5:1:45	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
5:6:16	5:6:19	g	yes 
5:9:10	5:9:17	g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
5:9:26	5:9:35	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
5:10:25	5:10:31	g	well just 
5:11:52	5:11:59	g	IY 
5:12:13	5:12:21	f	mm hmm 
5:12:35	5:12:41	g	and IY be go 
5:13:2	5:13:11	g	a little 
5:14:55	5:15:0	g	so IY be at the hot spring 
5:14:57	5:15:5	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
5:15:49	5:15:50	g	IY make 
5:16:20	5:16:25	g	uhm 
5:18:58	5:18:59	g	and  where the plane crash be 
5:18:55	5:19:2	g	and then IY you go up 
5:19:0	5:19:3	f	ok 
5:20:42	5:20:47	g	what 
5:22:15	5:22:19	g	like an inch 
5:22:21	5:22:22	g	probably the same thing 
5:22:24	5:22:26	g	after plane crash 
5:22:23	5:22:30	g	ok 
5:22:45	5:22:52	f	IY go to a lake 
5:24:9	5:24:17	g	the 
5:24:46	5:24:50	f	ok 
5:24:54	5:24:55	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
5:25:4	5:25:6	g	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
5:25:27	5:25:30	g	four or five inch to the leave 
5:26:34	5:26:34	g	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
5:28:34	5:28:36	f	yeah 
5:29:48	5:29:53	f	ok 
5:32:40	5:32:49	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything

5:33:15	5:33:19	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
5:36:17	5:36:22	g	be IY in like 
5:38:44	5:38:51	f	ok 
5:39:4	5:39:9	g	IY just kind of slope down 
5:41:19	5:41:20	g	IY move to the leave 
5:42:19	5:42:19	g	yes IY be go towards the lake 
5:43:3	5:43:3	g	then 
5:43:6	5:43:7	g	for about two inch 
5:43:9	5:43:17	g	and then IY go straight 
5:44:12	5:44:12	g	ok well 
5:45:33	5:45:38	g	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
5:47:59	5:48:4	g	but 
5:48:6	5:48:6	f	ok
