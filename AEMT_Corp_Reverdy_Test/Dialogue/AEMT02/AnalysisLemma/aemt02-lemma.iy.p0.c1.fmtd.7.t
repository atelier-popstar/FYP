start g
0	0:0:50	0:0:59	no 
1	0:1:23	0:1:32	not right at the stony desert 
2	0:1:59	0:2:4	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
5	0:3:53	0:3:55	the 
7	0:5:20	0:5:20	uhm 
9	0:8:9	0:8:9	and there  a plane crash 
10	0:8:17	0:8:22	ok well 
12	0:9:47	0:9:48	uhm 
15	0:18:47	0:18:49	couple inch IY be slope down 
16	0:18:55	0:18:58	be IY anywhere near there 
17	0:21:52	0:22:1	like 
20	0:25:10	0:25:14	three inch 
21	0:25:57	0:25:57	and IY be slope to the leave 
23	0:28:18	0:28:27	IY be start at the stony desert 
24	0:28:57	0:28:58	ok 
25	0:30:2	0:30:2	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
27	0:32:53	0:33:2	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
31	0:36:1	0:36:9	so IY be at the hot spring 
33	0:37:18	0:37:24	for like 
34	0:38:23	0:38:26	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
35	0:39:8	0:39:10	and IY be go up like 
36	0:39:9	0:39:12	uhm 
38	0:43:18	0:43:25	IY slope down again 
39	0:43:24	0:43:28	to the right 
43	0:48:6	0:48:8	and then IY will come to a savannah 
44	0:48:51	0:48:58	uhm 
45	0:50:22	0:50:25	IY would say 
46	0:50:35	0:50:38	the slate mountain be towards the right 
47	0:51:33	0:51:33	and it slope a little bit to the right 
49	0:54:8	0:54:11	alright well IY will keep go and see 
50	0:54:52	0:54:52	and be to the leave 
51	0:55:40	0:55:41	 little slope 
52	0:55:53	0:56:1	alright 
54	0:59:20	0:59:20	IY be go like 
56	1:2:33	1:2:37	ok well 
57	1:4:29	1:4:35	do IY have roman bath 
58	1:8:32	1:8:39	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
63	1:9:57	1:9:59	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
66	1:11:1	1:11:6	ok 
67	1:12:57	1:12:58	and then 
69	1:14:7	1:14:11	a little 
70	1:15:10	1:15:15	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
71	1:15:21	1:15:25	no 
73	1:19:34	1:19:43	ok 
75	1:21:14	1:21:14	and then 
76	1:24:36	1:24:38	maybe IY have different thing 
77	1:26:38	1:26:43	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
79	1:29:17	1:29:21	go up like three three and a half inch 
80	1:30:10	1:30:11	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
81	1:30:20	1:30:27	and then 
82	1:31:20	1:31:22	just do it like this ok 
83	1:33:43	1:33:43	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
84	1:36:2	1:36:11	well 
85	1:38:22	1:38:28	after IY slope down IY will say 
87	1:41:33	1:41:35	ok 
88	1:41:56	1:42:2	be the plane crash 
90	1:46:18	1:46:23	and then IY go 
91	1:46:44	1:46:44	and then IY you go up 
92	1:47:20	1:47:27	ok 
93	1:47:53	1:47:57	ok 
95	1:50:38	1:50:41	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
96	1:53:14	1:53:20	couple mile or something 
99	1:54:49	1:54:50	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
100	1:54:52	1:54:53	IY be go about 
102	1:55:48	1:55:53	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
103	1:55:56	1:56:0	like IY be slope 
104	1:59:11	1:59:14	uhm 
105	2:0:19	2:0:19	IY be kind of go 
106	2:2:19	2:2:20	uhm 
107	2:2:34	2:2:39	to right 
108	2:3:48	2:3:48	and then 
109	2:5:58	2:6:2	maybe four inch on the paper 
110	2:6:40	2:6:48	and 
111	2:7:3	2:7:3	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
112	2:8:13	2:8:20	maybe 
114	2:11:9	2:11:13	IY make 
115	2:12:2	2:12:11	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
117	2:12:48	2:12:55	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
118	2:13:6	2:13:8	probably the same thing 
119	2:13:5	2:13:12	then 
120	2:14:43	2:14:49	ok 
122	2:15:39	2:15:42	maybe like 
123	2:18:49	2:18:55	but 
124	2:19:17	2:19:23	IY be actually start like right 
125	2:19:18	2:19:27	IY have a waterhole on map 
126	2:20:6	2:20:13	to the leave 
127	2:21:31	2:21:35	what 
129	2:22:35	2:22:42	slight 
130	2:22:37	2:22:46	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
132	2:25:49	2:25:50	IY be at the plane crash 
133	2:26:50	2:26:50	yes 
134	2:27:21	2:27:25	for like 
135	2:28:2	2:28:10	and then 
136	2:28:18	2:28:22	ok 
137	2:28:35	2:28:39	uhm 
138	2:28:38	2:28:41	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
139	2:31:53	2:32:1	and then IY slope down to the leave 
140	2:34:46	2:34:52	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
141	2:35:35	2:35:43	ok 
142	2:35:46	2:35:50	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
143	2:38:1	2:38:1	uhm 
146	2:41:53	2:41:55	uhm 
147	2:42:2	2:42:8	 about five or six inch 
148	2:42:9	2:42:9	so anyway 
149	2:43:59	2:44:2	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
150	2:44:35	2:44:39	have a s 
151	2:50:0	2:50:0	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
152	2:50:40	2:50:46	IY be start 
154	2:53:53	2:54:2	after IY go straight again 
156	2:56:2	2:56:6	be IY in like 
157	2:57:15	2:57:23	three inch straight across 
158	2:58:52	2:58:53	uhm 
159	2:58:52	2:58:59	like four or five inch to the leave 
160	2:58:56	2:59:3	no IY have 
162	3:0:30	3:0:36	and then 
163	3:3:36	3:3:36	so IY go three inch straight 
165	3:6:27	3:6:34	there  a there  
166	3:7:3	3:7:10	ok IY be at the savannah 
167	3:8:1	3:8:2	and  where the plane crash be 
168	3:8:49	3:8:51	no there  no elephant 
169	3:10:4	3:10:7	three inch 
170	3:10:7	3:10:16	from 
171	3:10:59	3:11:5	maybe like 
172	3:12:26	3:12:27	five 
173	3:12:31	3:12:34	ok

178	3:16:55	3:16:56	ok 
181	3:22:27	3:22:35	no IY do n have a waterhole 
184	3:24:19	3:24:19	around the bottom of it 
186	3:26:40	3:26:47	ok 
187	3:27:25	3:27:34	and then IY be 
188	3:27:31	3:27:40	like 
190	3:28:45	3:28:47	ok 
191	3:30:3	3:30:6	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
194	3:31:17	3:31:20	IY be slope 
195	3:31:41	3:31:44	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
196	3:34:9	3:34:12	on sheet anyway 
198	3:35:54	3:35:57	and then IY go straight 
199	3:39:35	3:39:42	uhm IY straighten out slope 
201	3:41:5	3:41:12	straight up 
202	3:42:28	3:42:37	and 
204	3:45:5	3:45:13	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
205	3:45:11	3:45:15	yes IY be go towards the lake 
208	3:46:49	3:46:52	it  right next to it 
209	3:48:7	3:48:7	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
210	3:48:54	3:48:58	ok and then IY be go 
212	3:49:7	3:49:10	right next to circle should be roman bath 
213	3:51:53	3:51:55	ok 
214	3:52:4	3:52:6	be IY 
215	3:52:41	3:52:45	ok 
216	3:53:8	3:53:10	like an inch 
217	3:53:27	3:53:35	four or five inch to the leave 
219	3:56:56	3:57:0	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
220	3:57:22	3:57:24	to the leave 
221	3:58:54	3:58:54	so  about IY would say 
223	4:1:29	4:1:29	ok 
224	4:2:56	4:3:2	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
225	4:5:44	4:5:52	ok plane crash be n there 
226	4:6:5	4:6:12	they be there 
229	4:9:33	4:9:33	IY do n know 
231	4:9:39	4:9:42	and then IY slope up 
233	4:11:38	4:11:45	alright alright well just 
234	4:12:28	4:12:32	just a slight slope 
235	4:12:37	4:12:46	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
236	4:13:45	4:13:51	to the white mountain 
237	4:16:23	4:16:26	and then IY slope 
238	4:16:43	4:16:50	plane crash 
239	4:17:19	4:17:28	uhm 
240	4:18:5	4:18:7	and slope be about an inch long 
241	4:18:20	4:18:22	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
242	4:18:26	4:18:32	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
244	4:20:1	4:20:7	ok 
245	4:21:58	4:22:6	IY just kind of slope down 
246	4:22:9	4:22:10	ok 
247	4:22:57	4:23:1	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
251	4:26:21	4:26:27	kind of across from stony desert 
252	4:33:20	4:33:22	hmm 
253	4:35:50	4:35:52	ok 
254	4:36:48	4:36:54	so IY make circle 
255	4:37:10	4:37:13	away about like four inch four or five inch 
256	4:37:13	4:37:15	what 
258	4:41:9	4:41:13	for about two inch 
259	4:41:58	4:42:6	uhm 
260	4:42:9	4:42:11	uhm 
261	4:42:28	4:42:33	IY 
262	4:43:31	4:43:38	to the leave of little path where path should be 
264	4:45:51	4:45:58	and then 
266	4:47:39	4:47:44	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
267	4:48:24	4:48:27	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
268	4:50:59	4:51:6	uhm and there be a stony desert 
270	4:54:35	4:54:44	alright 
271	4:55:46	4:55:46	and then 
272	5:2:23	5:2:24	like three inch 
273	5:2:35	5:2:36	ok 
274	5:2:51	5:2:54	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
278	5:7:16	5:7:16	uh like 
279	5:8:44	5:8:48	uhm 
280	5:9:50	5:9:51	uhm 
282	5:10:1	5:10:7	a quarter of an inch 
283	5:10:9	5:10:10	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
284	5:11:19	5:11:23	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
286	5:16:0	5:16:2	and IY be go straight up 
287	5:16:16	5:16:25	like maybe an inch 
288	5:18:55	5:18:59	well just 
289	5:19:28	5:19:35	like 
290	5:20:0	5:20:1	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
291	5:20:42	5:20:42	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
294	5:23:46	5:23:55	an inch maybe a little bit less 
295	5:23:53	5:23:57	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
296	5:27:15	5:27:17	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
298	5:33:40	5:33:49	and IY just go straight up 
299	5:36:16	5:36:25	to the lake 
300	5:38:10	5:38:13	no IY do n have any rock 
301	5:41:20	5:41:28	IY move to the leave 
303	5:45:52	5:45:58	and IY be go 
306	5:50:20	5:50:26	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
307	5:53:9	5:53:12	a little bit too 
309	5:53:56	5:53:56	and IY should have a straight line there 
310	5:54:22	5:54:22	after plane crash 
311	5:57:38	5:57:40	IY be just go down 
312	5:58:16	5:58:16	so 
313	5:59:49	5:59:52	be IY in like almost the top of the 
314	5:59:48	5:59:57	ok 
315	6:2:14	6:2:17	well alright 
316	6:4:8	6:4:9	IY get

318	6:6:53	6:6:58	ok 
319	6:7:27	6:7:35	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
320	6:11:25	6:11:30	and 
321	6:12:4	6:12:11	IY wanna kind of curve 
322	6:13:19	6:13:24	it  not a big curve 
323	6:13:30	6:13:38	ok 
324	6:13:41	6:13:47	to the leave 
325	6:16:43	6:16:44	and then IY be go down 
328	6:21:2	6:21:6	ok 
329	6:22:24	6:22:27	be IY anywere near there 
330	6:24:39	6:24:42	and 
331	6:25:15	6:25:18	alright be IY start near the 
333	6:28:49	6:28:49	IY go like straight for about three inch but it  like a s 
336	6:30:54	6:31:0	like 
337	6:31:23	6:31:24	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
338	6:31:52	6:31:56	uhm 
339	6:33:20	6:33:20	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
340	6:35:10	6:35:12	yes 
341	6:35:15	6:35:22	after the circle 
342	6:35:45	6:35:53	IY go straight down 
start f
3	0:3:6	0:3:10	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
4	0:3:43	0:3:47	around the top of the lake 
6	0:4:59	0:5:2	ok 
8	0:7:47	0:7:56	ok 
11	0:8:24	0:8:32	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
13	0:11:17	0:11:24	ok 
14	0:15:21	0:15:22	ok 
18	0:22:11	0:22:14	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
19	0:22:28	0:22:28	ok 
22	0:28:7	0:28:7	ok 
26	0:32:42	0:32:44	ok 
28	0:33:26	0:33:34	yeah and IY go straight up 
29	0:34:26	0:34:31	and there  a collapse shelter 
30	0:35:53	0:35:53	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
32	0:36:27	0:36:29	ok 
37	0:40:31	0:40:33	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
40	0:44:27	0:44:35	elephant 
41	0:46:52	0:46:52	IY know IY have different thing so 
42	0:47:5	0:47:5	how many inch do IY think 
48	0:54:2	0:54:7	ok 
53	0:56:31	0:56:38	IY have a plane crash though 
55	1:1:13	1:1:13	mm hmm 
59	1:9:10	1:9:18	and curve down to the leave 
60	1:9:16	1:9:25	ok 
61	1:9:33	1:9:41	so wait 
62	1:9:42	1:9:44	ok

65	1:10:55	1:11:2	ok 
68	1:13:43	1:13:52	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
72	1:19:31	1:19:37	yeah 
74	1:20:11	1:20:20	nope IY have a white mountain 
78	1:27:45	1:27:53	ok 
86	1:40:16	1:40:25	ok 
89	1:42:38	1:42:43	around the lake to the top 
94	1:50:13	1:50:16	yeah 
97	1:53:36	1:53:41	ok 
98	1:54:29	1:54:31	to the leave 
101	1:54:52	1:54:57	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right

232	4:10:44	4:10:44	nope 
243	4:19:31	4:19:36	yeah

292	5:20:50	5:20:59	it  not like in the same place IY be describe 
293	5:23:48	5:23:48	do IY go by the plane crash 
297	5:33:32	5:33:34	yeah IY see 
302	5:42:45	5:42:46	to 
304	5:46:22	5:46:26	mm hmm

334	6:29:16	6:29:22	ok 
335	6:30:35	6:30:39	IY be three inch above the savannah 
start g
0	0:0:50	0:0:59	no 
1	0:1:23	0:1:32	not right at the stony desert 
2	0:1:59	0:2:4	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
5	0:3:53	0:3:55	the 
7	0:5:20	0:5:20	uhm 
9	0:8:9	0:8:9	and there  a plane crash 
10	0:8:17	0:8:22	ok well 
12	0:9:47	0:9:48	uhm 
15	0:18:47	0:18:49	couple inch IY be slope down 
16	0:18:55	0:18:58	be IY anywhere near there 
17	0:21:52	0:22:1	like 
20	0:25:10	0:25:14	three inch 
21	0:25:57	0:25:57	and IY be slope to the leave 
23	0:28:18	0:28:27	IY be start at the stony desert 
24	0:28:57	0:28:58	ok 
25	0:30:2	0:30:2	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
27	0:32:53	0:33:2	ok and then as IY be pass the white mountain 
31	0:36:1	0:36:9	so IY be at the hot spring 
33	0:37:18	0:37:24	for like 
34	0:38:23	0:38:26	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
35	0:39:8	0:39:10	and IY be go up like 
36	0:39:9	0:39:12	uhm 
38	0:43:18	0:43:25	IY slope down again 
39	0:43:24	0:43:28	to the right 
43	0:48:6	0:48:8	and then IY will come to a savannah 
44	0:48:51	0:48:58	uhm 
45	0:50:22	0:50:25	IY would say 
46	0:50:35	0:50:38	the slate mountain be towards the right 
47	0:51:33	0:51:33	and it slope a little bit to the right 
49	0:54:8	0:54:11	alright well IY will keep go and see 
50	0:54:52	0:54:52	and be to the leave 
51	0:55:40	0:55:41	 little slope 
52	0:55:53	0:56:1	alright

56	1:2:33	1:2:37	ok well 
57	1:4:29	1:4:35	do IY have roman bath 
58	1:8:32	1:8:39	but it  like a slight slope to the right as IY be go up but it  steep 
63	1:9:57	1:9:59	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
66	1:11:1	1:11:6	ok 
67	1:12:57	1:12:58	and then 
69	1:14:7	1:14:11	a little 
70	1:15:10	1:15:15	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
71	1:15:21	1:15:25	no 
73	1:19:34	1:19:43	ok 
75	1:21:14	1:21:14	and then 
76	1:24:36	1:24:38	maybe IY have different thing 
77	1:26:38	1:26:43	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
79	1:29:17	1:29:21	go up like three three and a half inch 
80	1:30:10	1:30:11	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
81	1:30:20	1:30:27	and then 
82	1:31:20	1:31:22	just do it like this ok 
83	1:33:43	1:33:43	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
84	1:36:2	1:36:11	well 
85	1:38:22	1:38:28	after IY slope down IY will say 
87	1:41:33	1:41:35	ok 
88	1:41:56	1:42:2	be the plane crash 
90	1:46:18	1:46:23	and then IY go 
91	1:46:44	1:46:44	and then IY you go up 
92	1:47:20	1:47:27	ok 
93	1:47:53	1:47:57	ok 
95	1:50:38	1:50:41	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
96	1:53:14	1:53:20	couple mile or something 
99	1:54:49	1:54:50	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
100	1:54:52	1:54:53	IY be go about 
102	1:55:48	1:55:53	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
103	1:55:56	1:56:0	like IY be slope 
104	1:59:11	1:59:14	uhm 
105	2:0:19	2:0:19	IY be kind of go 
106	2:2:19	2:2:20	uhm

108	2:3:48	2:3:48	and then 
109	2:5:58	2:6:2	maybe four inch on the paper 
110	2:6:40	2:6:48	and 
111	2:7:3	2:7:3	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
112	2:8:13	2:8:20	maybe 
114	2:11:9	2:11:13	IY make 
115	2:12:2	2:12:11	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
117	2:12:48	2:12:55	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
118	2:13:6	2:13:8	probably the same thing 
119	2:13:5	2:13:12	then 
120	2:14:43	2:14:49	ok

124	2:19:17	2:19:23	IY be actually start like right 
125	2:19:18	2:19:27	IY have a waterhole on map 
126	2:20:6	2:20:13	to the leave 
127	2:21:31	2:21:35	what 
129	2:22:35	2:22:42	slight 
130	2:22:37	2:22:46	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
132	2:25:49	2:25:50	IY be at the plane crash 
133	2:26:50	2:26:50	yes 
134	2:27:21	2:27:25	for like 
135	2:28:2	2:28:10	and then

138	2:28:38	2:28:41	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
139	2:31:53	2:32:1	and then IY slope down to the leave 
140	2:34:46	2:34:52	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
141	2:35:35	2:35:43	ok 
142	2:35:46	2:35:50	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything

149	2:43:59	2:44:2	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake  like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle 
150	2:44:35	2:44:39	have a s 
151	2:50:0	2:50:0	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
152	2:50:40	2:50:46	IY be start 
154	2:53:53	2:54:2	after IY go straight again 
156	2:56:2	2:56:6	be IY in like 
157	2:57:15	2:57:23	three inch straight across 
158	2:58:52	2:58:53	uhm 
159	2:58:52	2:58:59	like four or five inch to the leave 
160	2:58:56	2:59:3	no IY have 
162	3:0:30	3:0:36	and then 
163	3:3:36	3:3:36	so IY go three inch straight

166	3:7:3	3:7:10	ok IY be at the savannah 
167	3:8:1	3:8:2	and  where the plane crash be 
168	3:8:49	3:8:51	no there  no elephant 
169	3:10:4	3:10:7	three inch 
170	3:10:7	3:10:16	from 
171	3:10:59	3:11:5	maybe like

194	3:31:17	3:31:20	IY be slope 
195	3:31:41	3:31:44	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
196	3:34:9	3:34:12	on sheet anyway 
198	3:35:54	3:35:57	and then IY go straight 
199	3:39:35	3:39:42	uhm IY straighten out slope 
201	3:41:5	3:41:12	straight up 
202	3:42:28	3:42:37	and 
204	3:45:5	3:45:13	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
205	3:45:11	3:45:15	yes IY be go towards the lake 
208	3:46:49	3:46:52	it  right next to it 
209	3:48:7	3:48:7	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
210	3:48:54	3:48:58	ok and then IY be go 
212	3:49:7	3:49:10	right next to circle should be roman bath 
213	3:51:53	3:51:55	ok 
214	3:52:4	3:52:6	be IY 
215	3:52:41	3:52:45	ok 
216	3:53:8	3:53:10	like an inch 
217	3:53:27	3:53:35	four or five inch to the leave 
219	3:56:56	3:57:0	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
220	3:57:22	3:57:24	to the leave 
221	3:58:54	3:58:54	so  about IY would say 
223	4:1:29	4:1:29	ok 
224	4:2:56	4:3:2	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
225	4:5:44	4:5:52	ok plane crash be n there 
226	4:6:5	4:6:12	they be there 
229	4:9:33	4:9:33	IY do n know 
231	4:9:39	4:9:42	and then IY slope up 
233	4:11:38	4:11:45	alright alright well just 
234	4:12:28	4:12:32	just a slight slope 
235	4:12:37	4:12:46	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
236	4:13:45	4:13:51	to the white mountain 
237	4:16:23	4:16:26	and then IY slope 
238	4:16:43	4:16:50	plane crash 
239	4:17:19	4:17:28	uhm 
240	4:18:5	4:18:7	and slope be about an inch long 
241	4:18:20	4:18:22	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
242	4:18:26	4:18:32	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
244	4:20:1	4:20:7	ok 
245	4:21:58	4:22:6	IY just kind of slope down 
246	4:22:9	4:22:10	ok 
247	4:22:57	4:23:1	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
251	4:26:21	4:26:27	kind of across from stony desert 
252	4:33:20	4:33:22	hmm 
253	4:35:50	4:35:52	ok 
254	4:36:48	4:36:54	so IY make circle 
255	4:37:10	4:37:13	away about like four inch four or five inch 
256	4:37:13	4:37:15	what 
258	4:41:9	4:41:13	for about two inch

260	4:42:9	4:42:11	uhm 
261	4:42:28	4:42:33	IY 
262	4:43:31	4:43:38	to the leave of little path where path should be 
264	4:45:51	4:45:58	and then 
266	4:47:39	4:47:44	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
267	4:48:24	4:48:27	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
268	4:50:59	4:51:6	uhm and there be a stony desert 
270	4:54:35	4:54:44	alright 
271	4:55:46	4:55:46	and then 
272	5:2:23	5:2:24	like three inch 
273	5:2:35	5:2:36	ok 
274	5:2:51	5:2:54	and IY go to the leave a little bit 
278	5:7:16	5:7:16	uh like 
279	5:8:44	5:8:48	uhm 
280	5:9:50	5:9:51	uhm 
282	5:10:1	5:10:7	a quarter of an inch 
283	5:10:9	5:10:10	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
284	5:11:19	5:11:23	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
286	5:16:0	5:16:2	and IY be go straight up 
287	5:16:16	5:16:25	like maybe an inch 
288	5:18:55	5:18:59	well just 
289	5:19:28	5:19:35	like 
290	5:20:0	5:20:1	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
291	5:20:42	5:20:42	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
294	5:23:46	5:23:55	an inch maybe a little bit less 
295	5:23:53	5:23:57	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
296	5:27:15	5:27:17	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
298	5:33:40	5:33:49	and IY just go straight up 
299	5:36:16	5:36:25	to the lake 
300	5:38:10	5:38:13	no IY do n have any rock 
301	5:41:20	5:41:28	IY move to the leave 
303	5:45:52	5:45:58	and IY be go 
306	5:50:20	5:50:26	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
307	5:53:9	5:53:12	a little bit too 
309	5:53:56	5:53:56	and IY should have a straight line there 
310	5:54:22	5:54:22	after plane crash 
311	5:57:38	5:57:40	IY be just go down 
312	5:58:16	5:58:16	so 
313	5:59:49	5:59:52	be IY in like almost the top of the 
314	5:59:48	5:59:57	ok
