start
0:1:27	0:1:29	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inch to the leave 
0:1:42	0:1:44	g	be IY in like 
0:2:17	0:2:23	g	oh IY know what the white oh the white mountain no IY be way up there IY should n be over there 
0:4:3	0:4:7	g	and IY be slope down and then IY stop and IY go straight 
0:4:34	0:4:39	g	so IY be at the hot spring 
0:6:14	0:6:20	g	IY be go like 
0:7:23	0:7:26	g	and then IY be 
0:8:17	0:8:21	g	ok 
0:9:46	0:9:52	f	ok 
0:10:14	0:10:15	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake  kinda like in a s 
0:12:14	0:12:21	g	and there do IY have any like antelope or anything 
0:12:47	0:12:53	f	and curve down to the leave 
0:13:7	0:13:14	g	alright 
0:13:49	0:13:52	g	about like 
0:14:24	0:14:33	f	yeah

0:19:27	0:19:31	g	yes 
0:22:5	0:22:10	g	and IY should have a straight line there 
0:24:56	0:25:2	g	uhm 
0:25:8	0:25:15	f	IY go to a lake 
0:26:9	0:26:16	g	to the lake 
0:28:29	0:28:29	g	like 
0:29:47	0:29:56	g	as IY be slope down IY will come to hot well do IY have hot well 
0:30:50	0:30:57	g	then 
0:30:56	0:30:58	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
0:31:15	0:31:20	f	mm hmm 
0:31:41	0:31:45	g	 little slope 
0:31:54	0:32:1	f	IY know IY have different thing so 
0:32:54	0:33:3	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right 
0:33:14	0:33:19	g	ok 
0:33:28	0:33:31	g	uhm IY straighten out slope 
0:33:34	0:33:41	g	an inch maybe a little bit less 
0:35:27	0:35:35	f	mm hmm 
0:39:36	0:39:45	g	so IY be start and there  a stony desert right across from where IY start 
0:39:55	0:39:55	g	no the IY go to the leave of the antelope 
0:41:21	0:41:26	g	be IY anywhere near there 
0:42:33	0:42:37	f	ok 
0:44:36	0:44:38	g	ok 
0:44:37	0:44:38	g	and then 
0:45:40	0:45:48	g	and 
0:45:53	0:46:0	f	ok 
0:48:24	0:48:24	g	ok 
0:48:47	0:48:47	g	well IY do n really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right like it  a just a turn 
0:48:46	0:48:52	g	yes IY be go towards the lake 
0:51:0	0:51:3	f	so wait 
0:52:9	0:52:10	g	right next to circle should be roman bath 
0:52:19	0:52:20	g	and it slope a little bit to the right 
0:54:18	0:54:21	g	couple inch IY be slope down 
0:54:17	0:54:24	g	uhm 
0:54:31	0:54:36	g	now IY be curve to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about 
0:54:41	0:54:50	f	IY be at the savannah 
0:56:0	0:56:5	g	to the leave of little path where path should be 
0:57:17	0:57:21	g	well alright 
0:57:20	0:57:29	g	IY be at the plane crash 
0:57:21	0:57:30	g	IY be just go down 
0:57:31	0:57:35	g	IY be start 
0:58:45	0:58:52	g	and then 
1:2:23	1:2:27	g	a little bit too 
1:2:21	1:2:30	f	ok 
1:4:16	1:4:22	g	where be IY right now start at the savannah 
1:6:46	1:6:48	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inch 
1:6:44	1:6:50	g	and then IY slope 
1:9:21	1:9:23	f	ok 
1:11:3	1:11:6	f	IY be three inch above the savannah 
1:11:1	1:11:9	g	and be to the leave 
1:11:39	1:11:45	g	and IY come to a collapse shelter 
1:13:34	1:13:39	f	ok 
1:14:1	1:14:4	g	there  a there  
1:15:36	1:15:45	g	no 
1:18:34	1:18:38	g	maybe IY have different thing 
1:18:41	1:18:44	f	yeah 
1:18:43	1:18:49	f	IY have to back up a little bit 
1:21:14	1:21:15	f	and to the right 
1:23:18	1:23:19	g	be IY anywere near there 
1:23:30	1:23:34	g	around the bottom of it 
1:24:23	1:24:27	g	three inch 
1:27:6	1:27:11	g	ok 
1:27:50	1:27:55	g	and then IY slope down to the leave 
1:29:12	1:29:18	f	ok 
1:30:1	1:30:6	g	it  like a slight little upwards to the right 
1:32:59	1:33:1	f	yeah 
1:33:31	1:33:34	g	ok 
1:34:59	1:35:3	g	for about two inch 
1:35:34	1:35:43	g	the 
1:35:45	1:35:47	g	uhm 
1:35:43	1:35:48	g	a little past the antelope not much just so IY go around it 
1:36:11	1:36:14	g	what 
1:37:48	1:37:57	g	after IY go straight again 
1:39:51	1:39:56	g	and then slope just kind of gradually even out for like an inch as IY be go by the hot well 
1:40:12	1:40:20	g	it  right next to it 
1:40:51	1:40:55	g	ok well 
1:45:51	1:45:55	g	maybe like 
1:46:14	1:46:14	g	uhm 
1:46:28	1:46:33	g	ok 
1:46:35	1:46:37	g	like 
1:50:29	1:50:29	g	straight up 
1:50:32	1:50:36	g	plane crash 
1:51:35	1:51:36	g	like four or five inch to the leave 
1:52:54	1:52:54	f	nope 
1:53:29	1:53:37	g	and there  a plane crash 
1:57:52	1:57:58	f	around the lake to the top 
1:58:48	1:58:52	g	be the plane crash 
2:0:13	2:0:22	g	well 
2:0:16	2:0:23	f	ok 
2:1:42	2:1:44	g	IY be kind of go a little bit to the leave and then IY kind of slope down 
2:1:45	2:1:48	g	but 
2:4:53	2:4:53	g	so IY go three inch straight 
2:6:4	2:6:4	f	be IY suppose to hit every spot on the map 
2:7:18	2:7:21	g	yes 
2:8:6	2:8:6	g	IY make 
2:9:38	2:9:39	f	mm hmm 
2:11:0	2:11:9	f	mm hmm 
2:11:25	2:11:29	g	ok IY be at the savannah 
2:14:4	2:14:5	g	couple mile or something 
2:15:1	2:15:4	f	nope IY have a white mountain 
2:16:53	2:17:2	g	ok 
2:18:34	2:18:36	g	after IY slope down IY will say 
2:20:2	2:20:6	g	IY be not through anything yet IY be go actually around the lake 
2:20:56	2:21:5	g	alright 
2:21:10	2:21:11	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right 
2:21:39	2:21:43	g	and then IY you go up 
2:22:30	2:22:34	f	IY be start yeah the stony desert 
2:22:59	2:23:3	g	IY would say 
2:24:14	2:24:21	f	yeah 
2:25:16	2:25:20	f	ok 
2:27:36	2:27:40	f	ok 
2:28:50	2:28:54	f	IY have plane crash IY be talk about earlier  up there 
2:29:25	2:29:32	g	to the leave 
2:29:32	2:29:37	f	but  like five six inch from where IY be now 
2:33:13	2:33:22	g	ok 
2:33:43	2:33:51	g	ok 
2:34:41	2:34:42	g	uhm 
2:36:13	2:36:21	f	up tp the right 
2:37:27	2:37:34	g	like 
2:37:50	2:37:56	g	IY have a waterhole on map 
2:38:1	2:38:10	g	and  where the plane crash be 
2:38:5	2:38:12	g	it  not a big curve 
2:38:52	2:38:56	g	ok 
2:40:6	2:40:13	g	so  about IY would say 
2:40:8	2:40:15	g	IY go straight down 
2:41:21	2:41:26	f	ok 
2:43:17	2:43:24	g	and then IY slope up 
2:44:43	2:44:47	g	the slate mountain be towards the right 
2:44:49	2:44:54	g	uhm 
2:47:23	2:47:23	g	maybe like 
2:48:28	2:48:35	g	do IY have roman bath 
2:49:18	2:49:21	g	ok well 
2:50:25	2:50:33	g	ok and then IY be go 
2:50:50	2:50:50	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert be where IY start 
2:51:3	2:51:3	g	so anyway 
2:51:13	2:51:21	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
2:52:46	2:52:53	f	mm mm 
2:55:26	2:55:27	g	to the white mountain 
2:58:21	2:58:28	g	kind of across from stony desert 
3:0:41	3:0:44	f	and 
3:0:43	3:0:49	g	ok 
3:2:1	3:2:7	f	so IY go to the leave of the antelope 
3:4:56	3:4:58	g	they be there 
3:6:44	3:6:45	f	do IY go through anything 
3:7:22	3:7:26	f	ok 
3:10:54	3:10:54	g	IY be kind of go 
3:10:59	3:10:59	g	and slope be about two inch it  like a two inch slope 
3:13:44	3:13:49	g	be IY in like almost the top of the 
3:15:28	3:15:37	g	to right 
3:17:35	3:17:37	g	and then so IY be curve to the leave and IY go straight 
3:17:54	3:18:3	g	uhm 
3:19:21	3:19:23	f	mm hmm 
3:19:30	3:19:35	g	ok 
3:21:33	3:21:42	g	so it  a kinda like a grad not a gradual it  a steep slope 
3:25:40	3:25:41	f	ok 
3:27:23	3:27:30	g	and then IY be curve to the leave around slate mountain do IY have a slate mountain 
3:28:26	3:28:26	g	IY be actually start like right 
3:28:47	3:28:52	f	and then what 
3:29:0	3:29:7	g	and then IY be go down 
3:30:2	3:30:4	g	uhm 
3:32:15	3:32:18	g	 about five or six inch 
3:33:4	3:33:7	g	no there  no elephant 
3:34:35	3:34:38	g	uhm 
3:34:35	3:34:39	g	and IY be go 
3:35:36	3:35:43	g	ok 
3:36:1	3:36:6	f	IY hit some rock though 
3:40:46	3:40:46	f	yeah and IY go straight up 
3:43:29	3:43:32	g	and IY just go straight up 
3:44:48	3:44:54	g	no IY do n have a waterhole 
3:45:45	3:45:50	g	away about like four inch four or five inch 
3:46:5	3:46:8	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope 
3:46:7	3:46:13	g	for like 
3:48:26	3:48:32	g	and then 
3:49:53	3:49:54	f	uhm 
3:50:46	3:50:52	g	well 
3:52:40	3:52:49	g	IY finish out slope and IY go about an inch straight 
3:55:38	3:55:44	f	ok 
3:55:45	3:55:53	g	IY be start at the stony desert 
3:57:15	3:57:16	f	so four or five inch and then there  a plane crash 
3:57:23	3:57:32	g	for like 
3:57:33	3:57:39	g	hmm 
4:0:11	4:0:14	f	to 
4:1:15	4:1:22	g	alright alright well just 
4:4:3	4:4:7	g	and then

4:9:58	4:10:7	g	uhm 
4:12:10	4:12:10	g	IY go to the leave of the antelope just a little bit 
4:14:21	4:14:30	g	ok and IY have to go up a little way from the stony desert 
4:14:46	4:14:46	g	ok 
4:14:45	4:14:51	f	elephant 
4:14:50	4:14:54	g	it  like right there like where little path be it  right to the leave of it 
4:18:28	4:18:34	g	ok 
4:19:24	4:19:26	g	yes yeah IY just do n even go near there 
4:20:47	4:20:54	g	three inch 
4:20:56	4:21:5	g	ok 
4:21:10	4:21:16	g	five 
4:21:29	4:21:36	g	and then IY be up straight and IY have go the two inch 
4:24:58	4:25:1	g	where IY be go down to a plane crash 
4:25:2	4:25:5	g	in those three inch IY be kind of curve to te right but it  a slight curve 
4:29:0	4:29:1	g	yeah the plane crash be kinda over there yeah 
4:29:14	4:29:19	f	IY hit some round rock 
4:29:45	4:29:52	g	maybe an inch and a half two inch 
4:31:3	4:31:12	g	IY do n know 
4:31:11	4:31:18	f	ok 
4:31:56	4:31:56	g	and IY be go up like 
4:32:14	4:32:21	g	probably the same thing 
4:32:39	4:32:40	f	curve to the leave and what be how many inch away be the slate mountain 
4:37:12	4:37:19	g	uhm 
4:38:27	4:38:29	g	what 
4:39:42	4:39:42	g	no IY have 
4:39:56	4:40:5	f	plane crash IY do n think be yeah 
4:40:45	4:40:53	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down 
4:42:2	4:42:7	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
4:42:47	4:42:56	f	plane crash be on the other side but IY will just ok 
4:43:37	4:43:45	f	uh IY do n know know what to say 
4:45:12	4:45:12	g	IY 
4:46:8	4:46:14	g	alright well IY will keep go and see

4:52:37	4:52:41	g	uhm 
4:56:34	4:56:37	g	a quarter of an inch 
4:57:45	4:57:47	f	yeah 
4:59:17	4:59:18	f	do IY go around it 
4:59:18	4:59:20	g	and slope be about an inch long 
4:59:30	4:59:36	g	like IY be slope 
5:0:23	5:0:23	g	not right at the stony desert 
5:1:47	5:1:49	g	ok 
5:1:51	5:1:52	g	alright well just ignore the waterhole be IY near a savannah at all 
5:2:32	5:2:33	g	from 
5:4:1	5:4:7	g	like 
5:4:33	5:4:34	g	three inch straight across 
5:6:42	5:6:47	g	now IY be at the collapse shelter 
5:7:13	5:7:13	g	maybe four inch on the paper 
5:7:39	5:7:46	f	ok 
5:7:54	5:7:57	g	just do it like this ok 
5:8:38	5:8:40	g	four or five inch to the leave 
5:9:0	5:9:0	f	ok 
5:9:49	5:9:56	f	to the right 
5:10:47	5:10:50	g	and then 
5:13:33	5:13:33	f	ok 
5:17:11	5:17:15	g	and then after inch IY gradually well actually no it  not really gradual it  kinda like a steep slope up 
5:17:14	5:17:19	g	just a slight slope 
5:17:41	5:17:45	f	ok 
5:17:48	5:17:49	g	and 
5:18:47	5:18:49	f	around the top of the lake 
5:19:12	5:19:15	g	IY just kind of slope down 
5:19:52	5:19:53	f	oh 
5:19:49	5:19:56	g	like three inch 
5:22:5	5:22:9	g	a little 
5:24:43	5:24:50	g	the slate mountain be like diagonal from the white mountain 
5:25:47	5:25:53	g	after plane crash 
5:26:18	5:26:24	f	ok 
5:29:15	5:29:23	f	ok 
5:30:53	5:30:54	g	ok 
5:30:52	5:30:58	g	ok plane crash be n there 
5:32:4	5:32:6	g	and IY be go straight up 
5:32:8	5:32:17	g	maybe 
5:32:21	5:32:27	g	uhm 
5:32:32	5:32:38	g	uhm 
5:32:38	5:32:39	f	no IY will go with hot spring IY have 
5:32:44	5:32:46	f	ok wait hold on 
5:33:36	5:33:37	g	no 
5:33:35	5:33:40	g	after the circle 
5:33:41	5:33:43	g	to the leave 
5:34:37	5:34:46	g	uhm 
5:36:46	5:36:55	g	on sheet anyway 
5:38:39	5:38:39	g	and then IY go straight 
5:39:22	5:39:30	g	to the leave 
5:39:30	5:39:39	f	how many inch do IY think 
5:40:5	5:40:11	g	and curve to not down just curve to the leave 
5:40:45	5:40:49	f	be IY suppose to start at the same place 
5:41:17	5:41:24	g	have a s 
5:41:19	5:41:26	f	IY have a plane crash though 
5:42:20	5:42:20	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inch and  the finish 
5:43:38	5:43:42	g	ok 
5:44:19	5:44:19	g	IY get 
5:46:56	5:46:58	f	yep 
5:47:11	5:47:18	f	so from the start go down to the leave and then curve up around to the right 
5:49:8	5:49:8	g	be IY 
5:49:46	5:49:47	g	ok 
5:49:51	5:49:52	g	IY be slope 
5:50:11	5:50:19	g	and then IY go 
5:51:24	5:51:29	g	ok
