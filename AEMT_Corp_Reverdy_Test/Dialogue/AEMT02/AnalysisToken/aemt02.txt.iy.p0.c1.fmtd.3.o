start
0:1:10	0:1:16	f	uh IY don t know know what to say
0:1:33	0:1:34	g	and that s where the plane crash is
0:2:9	0:2:11	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
0:3:21	0:3:27	g	uhm
0:4:24	0:4:29	g	like
0:6:25	0:6:32	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
0:7:11	0:7:11	g	and IY re going
0:8:16	0:8:21	g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
0:11:20	0:11:22	g	IY re sloping
0:11:47	0:11:53	g	uhm
0:11:54	0:11:56	g	probably the same thing
0:11:47	0:11:56	g	ok IY re at the savannah
0:14:38	0:14:44	g	just do it like this ok
0:14:36	0:14:45	g	and then IY go straight
0:15:30	0:15:34	f	yep
0:18:25	0:18:27	g	like three inches 
0:18:54	0:19:3	g	uhm
0:21:46	0:21:53	g	ok
0:21:51	0:21:55	g	ok

0:25:38	0:25:40	f	ok
0:29:30	0:29:36	g	five
0:30:2	0:30:5	f	and curve down to the left 
0:30:12	0:30:13	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
0:30:11	0:30:20	g	like
0:30:58	0:30:58	g	straight up
0:32:31	0:32:40	g	IY go straight down
0:32:35	0:32:40	f	to the right 
0:35:6	0:35:6	g	that s IY little slope
0:37:50	0:37:58	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
0:38:29	0:38:34	g	a quarter of an inch
0:40:54	0:41:2	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
0:42:25	0:42:26	g	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
0:42:28	0:42:31	f	ok
0:42:45	0:42:47	g	IY re starting at the stony desert
0:42:54	0:42:58	g	maybe like
0:42:58	0:43:4	g	it s not a big curve
0:45:44	0:45:53	g	uhm
0:48:34	0:48:39	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
0:48:57	0:49:2	f	IY hit some round rocks
0:49:34	0:49:34	f	ok
0:49:44	0:49:48	g	so that s about IY would say
0:50:1	0:50:2	g	ok
0:50:14	0:50:20	g	and then
0:50:20	0:50:22	g	IY make
0:50:42	0:50:51	g	yes IY re going towards the lake
0:52:13	0:52:19	f	ok
0:52:14	0:52:19	g	ok
0:52:44	0:52:48	g	IY re just going down
0:53:23	0:53:24	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
0:54:9	0:54:16	f	ok
0:54:33	0:54:35	g	and then IY slope
0:55:56	0:56:4	g	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
0:57:23	0:57:24	f	and
1:0:54	1:0:57	f	ok
1:2:19	1:2:23	f	mm hmm
1:2:34	1:2:36	g	well alright

1:4:10	1:4:18	g	ok
1:4:24	1:4:25	g	well
1:4:30	1:4:37	f	IY go to a lake 
1:4:41	1:4:47	g	and there s a plane crash
1:4:56	1:4:56	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
1:5:18	1:5:19	g	kind of across from stony desert
1:5:51	1:5:52	f	ok
1:6:1	1:6:9	g	uhhh no
1:6:15	1:6:18	g	ok
1:6:33	1:6:42	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
1:8:5	1:8:11	g	so
1:13:16	1:13:20	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
1:15:17	1:15:25	g	ok 
1:15:33	1:15:33	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
1:16:21	1:16:24	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
1:17:3	1:17:3	g	from
1:19:11	1:19:19	f	around the lake to the top 
1:19:26	1:19:33	g	slight
1:19:31	1:19:38	g	IY re going like
1:19:39	1:19:45	g	and then
1:20:30	1:20:33	g	like four or five inches to the left
1:22:17	1:22:17	f	nope
1:23:28	1:23:31	f	yeah and IY went straight up
1:23:52	1:24:1	f	and to the right 
1:24:13	1:24:18	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
1:24:35	1:24:44	f	around the top of the lake 
1:24:56	1:25:3	f	ok
1:26:16	1:26:16	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
1:26:57	1:27:1	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
1:27:15	1:27:20	g	ok
1:29:32	1:29:39	g	the  
1:31:19	1:31:20	f	mm hmm
1:32:37	1:32:41	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
1:33:18	1:33:24	g	so IY go three inches straight
1:33:42	1:33:42	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
1:33:50	1:33:51	g	uhm
1:35:50	1:35:50	f	do IY go through anything 
1:35:44	1:35:53	g	around the bottom of it
1:36:13	1:36:22	g	no
1:37:35	1:37:38	g	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
1:38:42	1:38:45	g	maybe like
1:39:39	1:39:42	g	uhm
1:40:35	1:40:39	g	but
1:41:27	1:41:33	g	so IY make that circle
1:42:38	1:42:38	f	ok
1:46:31	1:46:33	f	yeah
1:47:4	1:47:11	g	ok
1:49:16	1:49:25	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
1:49:42	1:49:48	f	ok
1:50:5	1:50:7	g	a little
1:50:53	1:50:54	f	ok
1:51:59	1:52:1	g	and IY re sloping to the left
1:52:14	1:52:22	f	mm hmm
1:53:0	1:53:6	g	ok
1:53:51	1:53:56	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
1:54:10	1:54:13	g	and then
1:55:8	1:55:12	g	is the plane crash  
1:56:2	1:56:5	f	and then what 
1:56:13	1:56:19	f	ok
1:57:6	1:57:8	g	well
1:57:21	1:57:25	f	to the left of the antelope
1:57:57	1:57:59	f	to the left
2:0:19	2:0:25	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
2:3:22	2:3:24	f	ok
2:4:31	2:4:34	g	yes
2:5:12	2:5:15	g	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
2:5:48	2:5:57	g	ok
2:8:0	2:8:6	g	are IY in like   
2:8:9	2:8:18	g	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
2:8:55	2:9:2	g	IY would say
2:15:1	2:15:5	f	yeah
2:16:12	2:16:15	g	what 
2:16:31	2:16:40	g	ok
2:17:52	2:17:55	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
2:18:8	2:18:8	g	ok
2:21:34	2:21:42	g	ok
2:21:39	2:21:43	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
2:21:42	2:21:44	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
2:22:25	2:22:25	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
2:23:21	2:23:22	g	IY got that 
2:26:12	2:26:19	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
2:27:30	2:27:33	g	after that IY go straight again
2:29:0	2:29:4	g	uhm
2:30:39	2:30:44	g	ok
2:31:43	2:31:51	g	and 
2:31:49	2:31:55	f	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
2:34:57	2:34:57	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
2:37:23	2:37:24	f	ok
2:37:51	2:37:52	g	after plane crash
2:39:10	2:39:13	g	ok
2:39:13	2:39:15	g	IY re starting
2:40:41	2:40:43	f	ok
2:41:25	2:41:34	f	ok
2:43:59	2:44:6	g	four or five inches to the left
2:44:17	2:44:25	f	up tp the right
2:46:14	2:46:17	g	not right at the stony desert
2:46:42	2:46:50	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
2:46:56	2:47:0	g	ok
2:46:57	2:47:4	g	IY re actually starting like right
2:49:6	2:49:10	g	IY just kind of slope down
2:49:10	2:49:15	g	so anyway
2:50:29	2:50:36	g	and IY just go straight up
2:51:32	2:51:40	g	IY plane crash 
2:52:5	2:52:13	f	IY ve a plane crash though
2:52:15	2:52:15	g	no there s no elephants
2:55:21	2:55:25	g	no IY have  
2:56:14	2:56:15	g	to the white mountain
2:59:17	2:59:20	g	to IY right 
2:59:28	2:59:36	g	and IY re going up like
3:2:25	3:2:31	g	no
3:3:4	3:3:8	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
3:6:36	3:6:38	g	they re there
3:6:54	3:6:54	f	 IY m at the savannah
3:7:12	3:7:14	g	for like
3:7:26	3:7:27	g	and IY should have a straight line there
3:7:55	3:8:4	f	ok
3:8:3	3:8:9	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
3:9:29	3:9:30	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
3:10:8	3:10:14	g	and IY go to the left a little bit
3:12:6	3:12:13	g	and then IY re going down
3:14:56	3:14:57	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
3:21:1	3:21:6	g	like
3:21:45	3:21:54	g	IY slope down again
3:23:3	3:23:10	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
3:26:6	3:26:7	g	then
3:27:47	3:27:53	g	IY move to the left
3:29:27	3:29:27	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
3:32:6	3:32:15	f	ok
3:33:44	3:33:45	g	three inches
3:35:0	3:35:2	g	do IY have roman baths 
3:36:46	3:36:48	g	and then
3:37:25	3:37:31	g	have a s 
3:37:46	3:37:50	g	what 
3:38:46	3:38:49	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
3:38:57	3:38:59	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
3:39:46	3:39:54	f	ok
3:40:54	3:40:57	g	and then
3:41:9	3:41:13	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
3:41:16	3:41:16	g	and
3:42:39	3:42:46	g	well just
3:43:20	3:43:24	f	IY hit some rocks though
3:44:21	3:44:28	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
3:44:51	3:44:57	g	uhm
3:47:26	3:47:31	g	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
3:47:45	3:47:49	g	couple miles or something
3:51:27	3:51:33	f	ok
3:51:50	3:51:59	f	yeah IY see that
3:52:10	3:52:10	g	and then IY go
3:52:28	3:52:34	g	uhm
3:53:2	3:53:5	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
3:53:30	3:53:35	g	IY re at the plane crash
3:54:24	3:54:24	g	like maybe an inch
3:55:17	3:55:20	g	uhm
3:55:25	3:55:33	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
3:56:47	3:56:52	g	and then IY slope down to the left
3:56:54	3:56:56	g	and then IY are
3:57:18	3:57:26	g	uhm
3:58:56	3:59:5	g	maybe four inches on the paper
3:59:16	3:59:22	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
4:0:46	4:0:48	g	on IY sheet anyway
4:0:59	4:1:5	f	to 
4:1:44	4:1:45	g	you
4:3:19	4:3:24	f	so wait
4:4:17	4:4:18	g	to the right
4:4:41	4:4:50	g	ok
4:5:40	4:5:42	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
4:7:10	4:7:11	g	no IY don t have any rocks
4:8:35	4:8:44	f	ok wait hold on
4:10:41	4:10:47	g	are IY anywhere near there 
4:12:40	4:12:42	g	uhm
4:13:49	4:13:58	g	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
4:15:20	4:15:28	g	after the circle
4:16:38	4:16:42	g	three inches straight across
4:20:52	4:20:53	g	IY re kind of going  
4:21:16	4:21:23	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
4:21:33	4:21:39	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
4:22:42	4:22:50	g	to the lake 
4:23:1	4:23:1	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
4:28:59	4:29:3	g	like an inch
4:30:17	4:30:24	f	yeah
4:30:29	4:30:30	g	an inch maybe a little bit less
4:32:6	4:32:13	g	ok
4:35:12	4:35:15	f	yeah 
4:37:5	4:37:13	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
4:40:1	4:40:7	g	to the left
4:45:50	4:45:51	g	to the left
4:47:4	4:47:13	g	hmm
4:48:3	4:48:7	f	ok
4:48:37	4:48:38	g	alright alright well just
4:51:58	4:51:58	g	about like
4:52:5	4:52:11	g	after IY slope down IY d say
4:53:51	4:53:56	g	it s right next to it
4:54:34	4:54:43	g	for like
4:57:46	4:57:46	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
4:58:25	4:58:26	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
4:58:57	4:58:58	f	IY have to back up a little bit
4:59:35	4:59:35	g	are IY anywere near there 
4:59:41	4:59:43	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
5:0:56	5:1:3	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
5:2:6	5:2:15	g	ok well
5:4:16	5:4:19	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
5:6:41	5:6:46	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
5:7:21	5:7:30	g	and is to the left
5:7:37	5:7:38	f	IY m three inches above the savannah
5:7:34	5:7:42	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
5:7:53	5:8:0	f	IY know IY have different things so
5:9:11	5:9:20	g	ok and then IY re going
5:10:23	5:10:26	f	how many inches do IY think 
5:11:38	5:11:43	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
5:12:43	5:12:45	g	are IY  
5:13:24	5:13:32	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
5:14:38	5:14:43	g	uhm
5:15:33	5:15:33	g	uhm
5:20:16	5:20:18	f	ok
5:21:20	5:21:29	g	maybe
5:21:41	5:21:42	g	like IY re sloping
5:22:0	5:22:7	f	mm hmm
5:22:44	5:22:46	g	and then IY  IY go up
5:23:49	5:23:49	f	ok
5:27:21	5:27:25	f	ok
5:27:29	5:27:36	g	that s about five or six inches
5:27:58	5:27:59	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
5:27:57	5:28:6	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
5:28:11	5:28:14	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
5:31:24	5:31:33	f	mm hmm
5:32:49	5:32:56	g	yes
5:33:27	5:33:32	g	alright 
5:34:15	5:34:20	g	no IY don t have a waterhole
5:35:3	5:35:3	g	so IY re at the hot springs
5:36:0	5:36:1	g	IY don t know
5:36:5	5:36:13	g	ok
5:39:12	5:39:20	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
5:41:11	5:41:14	g	and then IY slope up
5:44:8	5:44:14	g	ok well
5:48:56	5:49:0	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
5:49:38	5:49:47	g	and then
5:55:7	5:55:13	g	IY wanna kind of curve
5:56:58	5:56:58	g	ok
5:57:39	5:57:40	g	just a slight slope
5:57:54	5:57:56	f	elephants 
5:58:53	5:59:0	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
5:59:45	5:59:46	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
6:0:22	6:0:26	g	uh like
6:1:30	6:1:33	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
6:1:57	6:1:57	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
6:5:15	6:5:24	g	for about two inches
6:6:31	6:6:31	g	maybe IY have different things
6:11:49	6:11:51	g	uhm
6:12:9	6:12:11	f	ok
6:13:42	6:13:43	g	to the left
6:13:50	6:13:55	g	and
