start
0:2:4	0:2:6	g	and then IY go
0:3:45	0:3:49	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
0:3:50	0:3:50	g	so IY re at the hot springs
0:4:53	0:4:55	g	to IY right 
0:9:10	0:9:15	f	ok
0:9:13	0:9:16	g	ok
0:9:24	0:9:27	f	ok wait hold on
0:9:50	0:9:52	g	IY just kind of slope down
0:18:53	0:18:54	f	 IY m at the savannah
0:19:53	0:20:1	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
0:20:27	0:20:29	g	there s a there s  
0:27:46	0:27:49	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
0:28:32	0:28:32	g	ok 
0:29:3	0:29:3	g	kind of across from stony desert
0:29:43	0:29:48	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
0:30:12	0:30:13	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
0:31:1	0:31:4	g	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
0:31:42	0:31:48	g	three inches
0:32:30	0:32:34	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
0:33:31	0:33:32	g	and IY re going up like
0:34:28	0:34:35	g	IY re actually starting like right
0:34:48	0:34:53	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
0:38:1	0:38:6	f	mm  mm
0:39:43	0:39:46	g	and IY just go straight up
0:39:53	0:39:55	f	ok
0:40:8	0:40:9	g	to the left
0:40:44	0:40:51	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
0:41:9	0:41:11	f	ok
0:43:58	0:44:3	g	ok
0:44:16	0:44:19	f	ok
0:44:31	0:44:40	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
0:45:11	0:45:15	g	well
0:47:32	0:47:39	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
0:48:42	0:48:51	g	ok
0:52:39	0:52:44	g	ok well
0:54:38	0:54:44	f	uh IY don t know know what to say

0:56:57	0:57:6	g	and then
0:59:49	0:59:56	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
1:1:43	1:1:46	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
1:2:23	1:2:23	g	ok
1:4:28	1:4:30	f	yeah and IY went straight up
1:4:33	1:4:35	f	yeah
1:6:35	1:6:37	g	like
1:6:38	1:6:41	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
1:6:50	1:6:57	g	maybe IY have different things
1:7:44	1:7:52	g	and then
1:8:17	1:8:22	g	ok
1:9:52	1:9:55	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
1:11:26	1:11:29	f	do IY go through anything 
1:13:42	1:13:45	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
1:14:7	1:14:16	g	to the lake 
1:15:37	1:15:38	g	uhm
1:17:23	1:17:23	g	and then IY go straight
1:18:2	1:18:4	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
1:18:54	1:18:58	g	and then IY re going down
1:19:29	1:19:31	f	yep
1:20:25	1:20:30	f	and then what 
1:20:40	1:20:41	f	mm hmm

1:23:25	1:23:25	g	a little bit too
1:25:8	1:25:15	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
1:26:30	1:26:37	g	and there s a plane crash
1:26:49	1:26:51	g	ok well
1:26:48	1:26:54	f	up tp the right
1:27:41	1:27:42	f	yeah 
1:28:58	1:29:4	g	about like
1:29:38	1:29:40	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
1:30:29	1:30:37	g	and IY re going straight up
1:31:47	1:31:48	g	after the circle
1:32:40	1:32:45	f	elephants 
1:35:45	1:35:53	g	and
1:36:4	1:36:10	g	ok and then IY re going

1:49:38	1:49:47	g	you
1:49:51	1:49:54	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
1:50:27	1:50:28	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
1:50:36	1:50:45	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right
1:51:19	1:51:28	f	ok
1:51:39	1:51:41	g	ok
1:51:54	1:52:1	g	that s IY little slope
1:53:47	1:53:56	g	they re there
1:55:18	1:55:19	g	and then
1:55:28	1:55:32	g	on IY sheet anyway
1:57:39	1:57:42	f	IY m three inches above the savannah
1:59:54	2:0:2	g	and then IY slope up
2:2:50	2:2:59	g	IY wanna kind of curve
2:4:58	2:5:6	g	like IY re sloping
2:5:28	2:5:30	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
2:5:40	2:5:42	g	uhm
2:7:13	2:7:14	f	IY hit some round rocks
2:7:23	2:7:23	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
2:7:48	2:7:55	f	mm hmm
2:8:5	2:8:7	g	uhm
2:8:56	2:8:56	g	for like
2:10:38	2:10:47	f	mm hmm

2:13:32	2:13:35	g	so that s about IY would say
2:14:28	2:14:31	g	and then IY are
2:14:39	2:14:45	g	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
2:14:52	2:14:58	f	mm hmm
2:19:1	2:19:10	g	alright alright well just
2:19:31	2:19:35	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
2:20:20	2:20:22	g	to the white mountain
2:20:18	2:20:25	g	to the left
2:22:4	2:22:11	g	uhm
2:23:22	2:23:27	f	to 
2:26:24	2:26:32	g	IY move to the left
2:26:44	2:26:45	g	is the plane crash  
2:27:44	2:27:53	g	and IY re sloping to the left
2:28:15	2:28:22	g	uhm
2:30:0	2:30:3	f	ok
2:30:6	2:30:13	f	IY know IY have different things so
2:30:48	2:30:56	f	yeah IY see that
2:33:34	2:33:42	f	nope IY have a white mountain
2:33:58	2:34:6	g	like maybe an inch
2:34:44	2:34:49	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
2:36:40	2:36:41	g	three inches
2:36:41	2:36:49	g	yes
2:37:25	2:37:26	g	ok
2:38:20	2:38:29	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
2:39:3	2:39:8	g	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
2:40:27	2:40:33	f	ok
2:40:37	2:40:40	g	well
2:40:42	2:40:49	g	then
2:41:31	2:41:35	g	alright 
2:43:4	2:43:13	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
2:43:46	2:43:51	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
2:44:8	2:44:10	g	yes
2:44:37	2:44:39	g	and then
2:45:40	2:45:44	g	ok

2:49:41	2:49:46	f	ok
2:51:39	2:51:48	f	and
2:52:12	2:52:12	f	and curve down to the left 
2:54:5	2:54:8	f	ok
2:54:52	2:55:1	g	it s not a big curve
2:55:9	2:55:18	g	are IY  
2:56:49	2:56:50	f	ok
2:58:51	2:58:52	g	like
2:59:16	2:59:18	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
2:59:40	2:59:44	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
3:1:14	3:1:14	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
3:1:13	3:1:21	f	ok
3:1:58	3:2:2	g	just do it like this ok
3:4:7	3:4:8	g	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
3:5:33	3:5:38	g	to the left
3:5:51	3:5:58	f	ok
3:6:42	3:6:50	g	like
3:8:12	3:8:13	g	maybe four inches on the paper
3:8:43	3:8:48	g	so
3:10:19	3:10:24	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
3:11:35	3:11:43	g	ok
3:12:18	3:12:26	g	that s about five or six inches
3:13:27	3:13:29	g	and then
3:15:20	3:15:23	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
3:15:46	3:15:47	g	IY re kind of going  
3:17:6	3:17:9	g	uhm
3:21:33	3:21:38	g	are IY anywhere near there 
3:25:18	3:25:18	g	and then IY slope down to the left
3:25:50	3:25:54	f	do IY go around it 
3:26:6	3:26:12	g	like an inch
3:26:52	3:27:0	g	uhm
3:27:30	3:27:35	g	uh like
3:28:16	3:28:24	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
3:28:53	3:29:0	f	IY have to back up a little bit
3:30:47	3:30:48	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
3:33:33	3:33:33	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
3:34:44	3:34:45	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
3:35:25	3:35:31	g	and then IY slope
3:35:58	3:36:2	g	maybe
3:37:9	3:37:10	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
3:37:12	3:37:20	g	IY make
3:38:27	3:38:36	g	what 
3:38:56	3:39:2	g	ok
3:39:55	3:40:0	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
3:39:55	3:40:4	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
3:41:49	3:41:54	f	IY hit some rocks though
3:42:21	3:42:21	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
3:43:11	3:43:18	f	yeah
3:44:10	3:44:11	g	IY plane crash 
3:44:8	3:44:13	g	IY don t know
3:44:29	3:44:30	g	couple miles or something
3:45:9	3:45:13	g	uhm
3:46:38	3:46:38	g	just a slight slope
3:46:56	3:47:0	g	IY go straight down
3:47:53	3:47:56	g	so IY make that circle
3:48:58	3:49:4	g	uhm
3:50:29	3:50:29	g	uhm
3:54:20	3:54:22	g	well just
3:54:46	3:54:52	g	but
3:55:37	3:55:40	g	ok IY re at the savannah
3:55:37	3:55:46	f	yeah
3:56:14	3:56:14	g	a quarter of an inch
3:56:17	3:56:21	g	and then
3:57:33	3:57:34	f	yeah
3:59:14	3:59:18	g	after plane crash
3:59:40	3:59:48	f	around the lake to the top 
4:3:1	4:3:4	f	ok
4:4:43	4:4:47	g	like three inches 
4:5:11	4:5:12	g	ok
4:5:8	4:5:16	f	how many inches do IY think 
4:6:8	4:6:12	g	slight
4:7:26	4:7:34	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
4:9:7	4:9:11	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
4:9:31	4:9:40	f	ok
4:9:46	4:9:50	g	ok
4:10:20	4:10:23	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
4:11:46	4:11:51	g	and IY should have a straight line there
4:12:54	4:12:54	g	and then
4:12:56	4:13:4	g	ok
4:14:22	4:14:27	g	from
4:17:29	4:17:29	g	ok
4:19:17	4:19:21	g	uhm
4:22:50	4:22:51	g	uhm
4:26:33	4:26:36	g	ok
4:27:24	4:27:29	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
4:29:59	4:30:1	f	IY go to a lake 
4:30:12	4:30:16	g	and is to the left
4:30:58	4:31:7	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
4:31:37	4:31:39	g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
4:31:53	4:31:54	g	after IY slope down IY d say
4:33:42	4:33:46	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
4:33:58	4:34:0	g	around the bottom of it
4:35:13	4:35:18	g	ok
4:35:16	4:35:18	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
4:37:31	4:37:39	g	are IY in like   
4:37:47	4:37:53	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
4:38:10	4:38:17	g	no
4:38:18	4:38:26	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
4:38:59	4:39:4	g	ok
4:42:32	4:42:34	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
4:43:12	4:43:18	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
4:46:19	4:46:22	g	IY re starting at the stony desert
4:49:15	4:49:20	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
4:49:19	4:49:27	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
4:49:57	4:50:5	g	IY re starting
4:51:25	4:51:30	f	ok
4:51:30	4:51:36	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
4:51:54	4:51:55	f	ok
4:52:11	4:52:15	g	ok
4:54:47	4:54:53	g	IY got that 
4:55:46	4:55:49	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
4:56:11	4:56:15	f	ok
5:0:18	5:0:24	g	IY re sloping
5:1:54	5:2:2	g	uhm
5:4:30	5:4:38	g	uhm
5:5:15	5:5:15	g	a little
5:6:16	5:6:25	f	ok
5:6:59	5:7:1	g	to the right
5:10:3	5:10:6	g	do IY have roman baths 
5:11:34	5:11:38	g	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
5:12:13	5:12:17	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
5:12:25	5:12:27	f	yeah 
5:12:51	5:12:52	f	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
5:14:40	5:14:46	f	ok
5:15:16	5:15:17	g	straight up
5:15:25	5:15:25	g	have a s 
5:17:6	5:17:15	g	for about two inches
5:17:20	5:17:24	f	ok
5:19:6	5:19:10	g	what 
5:19:49	5:19:57	g	alright 
5:21:27	5:21:32	g	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
5:22:19	5:22:26	g	and then IY  IY go up
5:23:52	5:23:54	g	ok
5:24:14	5:24:15	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
5:24:28	5:24:33	g	ok
5:25:58	5:26:5	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
5:28:20	5:28:20	g	uhm
5:31:37	5:31:46	g	and that s where the plane crash is
5:31:51	5:31:51	g	IY would say
5:32:10	5:32:16	g	uhm
5:33:46	5:33:47	g	not right at the stony desert
5:34:18	5:34:23	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
5:36:34	5:36:34	f	and to the right 
5:38:52	5:38:56	f	to the left
5:40:34	5:40:36	g	maybe like
5:42:13	5:42:16	f	IY ve a plane crash though
5:43:7	5:43:8	g	probably the same thing
5:44:2	5:44:8	g	IY slope down again
5:45:13	5:45:22	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
5:45:17	5:45:25	g	five
5:46:31	5:46:40	g	three inches straight across
5:47:39	5:47:40	g	and 
5:47:44	5:47:50	g	ok
5:48:27	5:48:36	g	no IY don t have a waterhole
5:49:10	5:49:13	g	ok
5:50:21	5:50:28	g	no
5:50:34	5:50:40	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
5:50:57	5:51:3	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
5:51:48	5:51:57	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
5:52:22	5:52:24	f	uhm IY
5:53:41	5:53:42	f	ok
5:57:41	5:57:41	f	ok
5:59:18	5:59:21	g	like four or five inches to the left
6:2:31	6:2:39	g	so anyway
6:3:28	6:3:29	f	ok
6:4:30	6:4:31	g	IY re going like
6:5:49	6:5:50	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
6:5:53	6:5:54	g	and then
