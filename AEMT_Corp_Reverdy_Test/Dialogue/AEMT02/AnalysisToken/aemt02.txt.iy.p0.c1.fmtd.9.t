start
start g
0	0:2:4	0:2:6	and then IY go
1	0:3:45	0:3:49	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
2	0:3:50	0:3:50	so IY re at the hot springs
3	0:4:53	0:4:55	to IY right 
5	0:9:13	0:9:16	ok
7	0:9:50	0:9:52	IY just kind of slope down
10	0:20:27	0:20:29	there s a there s  
11	0:27:46	0:27:49	are IY in like almost the top of the
12	0:28:32	0:28:32	ok 
13	0:29:3	0:29:3	kind of across from stony desert
14	0:29:43	0:29:48	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
16	0:31:1	0:31:4	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
17	0:31:42	0:31:48	three inches
18	0:32:30	0:32:34	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
19	0:33:31	0:33:32	and IY re going up like
20	0:34:28	0:34:35	IY re actually starting like right
21	0:34:48	0:34:53	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
23	0:39:43	0:39:46	and IY just go straight up
25	0:40:8	0:40:9	to the left
26	0:40:44	0:40:51	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
28	0:43:58	0:44:3	ok
31	0:45:11	0:45:15	well
33	0:48:42	0:48:51	ok
34	0:52:39	0:52:44	ok well
36	0:54:54	0:54:57	well alright
37	0:55:29	0:55:34	and
39	0:56:57	0:57:6	and then
40	0:59:49	0:59:56	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
41	1:1:43	1:1:46	the slate mountain is towards the right
42	1:2:23	1:2:23	ok
45	1:6:35	1:6:37	like
46	1:6:38	1:6:41	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
47	1:6:50	1:6:57	maybe IY have different things
48	1:7:44	1:7:52	and then
49	1:8:17	1:8:22	ok
50	1:9:52	1:9:55	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
52	1:13:42	1:13:45	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
53	1:14:7	1:14:16	to the lake 
54	1:15:37	1:15:38	uhm
55	1:17:23	1:17:23	and then IY go straight
56	1:18:2	1:18:4	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
57	1:18:54	1:18:58	and then IY re going down
61	1:21:51	1:21:52	so IY go three inches straight
62	1:23:25	1:23:25	a little bit too
63	1:25:8	1:25:15	ok IY plane crash isn t there
64	1:26:30	1:26:37	and there s a plane crash
65	1:26:49	1:26:51	ok well
68	1:28:58	1:29:4	about like
69	1:29:38	1:29:40	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
70	1:30:29	1:30:37	and IY re going straight up
71	1:31:47	1:31:48	after the circle
73	1:35:45	1:35:53	and
74	1:36:4	1:36:10	ok and then IY re going
75	1:37:10	1:37:14	for like
76	1:37:32	1:37:39	no IY don t have any rocks
78	1:44:12	1:44:20	no IY have  
79	1:48:10	1:48:14	it s right next to it
80	1:49:7	1:49:14	ok
81	1:49:30	1:49:33	IY re just going down
82	1:49:38	1:49:47	you
84	1:50:27	1:50:28	and it slopes a little bit to the right
85	1:50:36	1:50:45	and IY go down IY slope to the right
87	1:51:39	1:51:41	ok
88	1:51:54	1:52:1	that s IY little slope
89	1:53:47	1:53:56	they re there
90	1:55:18	1:55:19	and then
91	1:55:28	1:55:32	on IY sheet anyway
93	1:59:54	2:0:2	and then IY slope up
94	2:2:50	2:2:59	IY wanna kind of curve
95	2:4:58	2:5:6	like IY re sloping
96	2:5:28	2:5:30	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
97	2:5:40	2:5:42	uhm
99	2:7:23	2:7:23	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
101	2:8:5	2:8:7	uhm
102	2:8:56	2:8:56	for like
106	2:13:6	2:13:7	like
107	2:13:32	2:13:35	so that s about IY would say
108	2:14:28	2:14:31	and then IY are
109	2:14:39	2:14:45	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
111	2:19:1	2:19:10	alright alright well just
113	2:20:20	2:20:22	to the white mountain
114	2:20:18	2:20:25	to the left
115	2:22:4	2:22:11	uhm
117	2:26:24	2:26:32	IY move to the left
118	2:26:44	2:26:45	is the plane crash  
119	2:27:44	2:27:53	and IY re sloping to the left
120	2:28:15	2:28:22	uhm
125	2:33:58	2:34:6	like maybe an inch
127	2:36:40	2:36:41	three inches
128	2:36:41	2:36:49	yes
129	2:37:25	2:37:26	ok
131	2:39:3	2:39:8	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
133	2:40:37	2:40:40	well
134	2:40:42	2:40:49	then
135	2:41:31	2:41:35	alright 
136	2:43:4	2:43:13	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
137	2:43:46	2:43:51	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
138	2:44:8	2:44:10	yes
139	2:44:37	2:44:39	and then
140	2:45:40	2:45:44	ok
141	2:48:13	2:48:19	are IY anywere near there 
146	2:54:52	2:55:1	it s not a big curve
147	2:55:9	2:55:18	are IY  
149	2:58:51	2:58:52	like
150	2:59:16	2:59:18	couple inches IY re sloping down
151	2:59:40	2:59:44	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
152	3:1:14	3:1:14	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
154	3:1:58	3:2:2	just do it like this ok
155	3:4:7	3:4:8	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
156	3:5:33	3:5:38	to the left
158	3:6:42	3:6:50	like
159	3:8:12	3:8:13	maybe four inches on the paper
160	3:8:43	3:8:48	so
161	3:10:19	3:10:24	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
162	3:11:35	3:11:43	ok
163	3:12:18	3:12:26	that s about five or six inches
164	3:13:27	3:13:29	and then
165	3:15:20	3:15:23	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
166	3:15:46	3:15:47	IY re kind of going  
167	3:17:6	3:17:9	uhm
168	3:21:33	3:21:38	are IY anywhere near there 
169	3:25:18	3:25:18	and then IY slope down to the left
171	3:26:6	3:26:12	like an inch
172	3:26:52	3:27:0	uhm
173	3:27:30	3:27:35	uh like
174	3:28:16	3:28:24	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
176	3:30:47	3:30:48	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
177	3:33:33	3:33:33	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
178	3:34:44	3:34:45	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
179	3:35:25	3:35:31	and then IY slope
180	3:35:58	3:36:2	maybe
182	3:37:12	3:37:20	IY make
183	3:38:27	3:38:36	what 
184	3:38:56	3:39:2	ok
185	3:39:55	3:40:0	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
186	3:39:55	3:40:4	where IY re going down to a plane crash
188	3:42:21	3:42:21	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
190	3:44:10	3:44:11	IY plane crash 
191	3:44:8	3:44:13	IY don t know
192	3:44:29	3:44:30	couple miles or something
193	3:45:9	3:45:13	uhm
194	3:46:38	3:46:38	just a slight slope
195	3:46:56	3:47:0	IY go straight down
196	3:47:53	3:47:56	so IY make that circle
197	3:48:58	3:49:4	uhm
198	3:50:29	3:50:29	uhm
199	3:54:20	3:54:22	well just
200	3:54:46	3:54:52	but
201	3:55:37	3:55:40	ok IY re at the savannah
203	3:56:14	3:56:14	a quarter of an inch
204	3:56:17	3:56:21	and then
206	3:59:14	3:59:18	after plane crash
209	4:4:43	4:4:47	like three inches 
210	4:5:11	4:5:12	ok
212	4:6:8	4:6:12	slight
216	4:9:46	4:9:50	ok
217	4:10:20	4:10:23	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
218	4:11:46	4:11:51	and IY should have a straight line there
219	4:12:54	4:12:54	and then
220	4:12:56	4:13:4	ok
221	4:14:22	4:14:27	from
222	4:17:29	4:17:29	ok
223	4:19:17	4:19:21	uhm
224	4:22:50	4:22:51	uhm
225	4:26:33	4:26:36	ok
226	4:27:24	4:27:29	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
228	4:30:12	4:30:16	and is to the left
230	4:31:37	4:31:39	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
231	4:31:53	4:31:54	after IY slope down IY d say
232	4:33:42	4:33:46	uhm and there is a stony desert
233	4:33:58	4:34:0	around the bottom of it
234	4:35:13	4:35:18	ok
235	4:35:16	4:35:18	go up like three  three and a half inches
236	4:37:31	4:37:39	are IY in like   
237	4:37:47	4:37:53	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
238	4:38:10	4:38:17	no
240	4:38:59	4:39:4	ok
241	4:42:32	4:42:34	alright well IY ll keep going and see
242	4:43:12	4:43:18	and then IY ll come to a savannah
243	4:46:19	4:46:22	IY re starting at the stony desert
245	4:49:19	4:49:27	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
246	4:49:57	4:50:5	IY re starting
248	4:51:30	4:51:36	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
250	4:52:11	4:52:15	ok
251	4:54:47	4:54:53	IY got that 
252	4:55:46	4:55:49	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
254	5:0:18	5:0:24	IY re sloping
255	5:1:54	5:2:2	uhm
256	5:4:30	5:4:38	uhm
257	5:5:15	5:5:15	a little
259	5:6:59	5:7:1	to the right
260	5:10:3	5:10:6	do IY have roman baths 
261	5:11:34	5:11:38	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
266	5:15:16	5:15:17	straight up
267	5:15:25	5:15:25	have a s 
268	5:17:6	5:17:15	for about two inches
270	5:19:6	5:19:10	what 
271	5:19:49	5:19:57	alright 
272	5:21:27	5:21:32	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
273	5:22:19	5:22:26	and then IY  IY go up
274	5:23:52	5:23:54	ok
276	5:24:28	5:24:33	ok
277	5:25:58	5:26:5	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
278	5:28:20	5:28:20	uhm
279	5:31:37	5:31:46	and that s where the plane crash is
280	5:31:51	5:31:51	IY would say
281	5:32:10	5:32:16	uhm
282	5:33:46	5:33:47	not right at the stony desert
283	5:34:18	5:34:23	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
286	5:40:34	5:40:36	maybe like
288	5:43:7	5:43:8	probably the same thing
289	5:44:2	5:44:8	IY slope down again
291	5:45:17	5:45:25	five
292	5:46:31	5:46:40	three inches straight across
293	5:47:39	5:47:40	and 
294	5:47:44	5:47:50	ok
295	5:48:27	5:48:36	no IY don t have a waterhole
296	5:49:10	5:49:13	ok
297	5:50:21	5:50:28	no
299	5:50:57	5:51:3	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
300	5:51:48	5:51:57	alright are IY starting  near the  
304	5:59:18	5:59:21	like four or five inches to the left
305	6:2:31	6:2:39	so anyway
307	6:4:30	6:4:31	IY re going like
308	6:5:49	6:5:50	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
309	6:5:53	6:5:54	and then
310	6:6:30	6:6:35	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
311	6:6:54	6:7:2	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
313	6:13:11	6:13:18	an inch maybe a little bit less
314	6:14:39	6:14:43	and IY go to the left a little bit
315	6:15:3	6:15:7	ok
319	6:18:12	6:18:19	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
320	6:19:12	6:19:13	four or five inches to the left
321	6:22:4	6:22:11	IY re at the plane crash
322	6:23:2	6:23:8	and IY slope is about an inch long
323	6:25:59	6:26:7	IY re going about
324	6:27:34	6:27:40	no there s no elephants
325	6:28:43	6:28:44	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
327	6:30:39	6:30:47	uhm
328	6:31:19	6:31:25	and 
329	6:33:5	6:33:9	the  
330	6:34:42	6:34:46	yes IY re going towards the lake
332	6:37:34	6:37:41	after that IY go straight again
334	6:41:11	6:41:15	and IY re going
335	6:42:39	6:42:47	hmm
336	6:45:54	6:45:59	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
337	6:46:37	6:46:43	maybe like
338	6:49:28	6:49:32	uhhh no
342	6:52:2	6:52:7	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it

6	0:9:24	0:9:27	ok wait hold on
8	0:18:53	0:18:54	 IY m at the savannah
9	0:19:53	0:20:1	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
15	0:30:12	0:30:13	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
22	0:38:1	0:38:6	mm  mm
24	0:39:53	0:39:55	ok
27	0:41:9	0:41:11	ok
29	0:44:16	0:44:19	ok
30	0:44:31	0:44:40	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
32	0:47:32	0:47:39	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
35	0:54:38	0:54:44	uh IY don t know know what to say
38	0:56:39	0:56:44	oh
43	1:4:28	1:4:30	yeah and IY went straight up

77	1:44:2	1:44:11	ok
83	1:49:51	1:49:54	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
86	1:51:19	1:51:28	ok
92	1:57:39	1:57:42	IY m three inches above the savannah
98	2:7:13	2:7:14	IY hit some round rocks
100	2:7:48	2:7:55	mm hmm
103	2:10:38	2:10:47	mm hmm
104	2:10:48	2:10:54	ok

110	2:14:52	2:14:58	mm hmm
112	2:19:31	2:19:35	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
116	2:23:22	2:23:27	to 
121	2:30:0	2:30:3	ok
122	2:30:6	2:30:13	IY know IY have different things so

124	2:33:34	2:33:42	nope IY have a white mountain
126	2:34:44	2:34:49	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
130	2:38:20	2:38:29	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
132	2:40:27	2:40:33	ok

175	3:28:53	3:29:0	IY have to back up a little bit
181	3:37:9	3:37:10	and there s a collapsed shelter
187	3:41:49	3:41:54	IY hit some rocks though
189	3:43:11	3:43:18	yeah
202	3:55:37	3:55:46	yeah
205	3:57:33	3:57:34	yeah
207	3:59:40	3:59:48	around the lake to the top 
208	4:3:1	4:3:4	ok
211	4:5:8	4:5:16	how many inches do IY think 
213	4:7:26	4:7:34	so IY go to the left of the antelope
214	4:9:7	4:9:11	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
215	4:9:31	4:9:40	ok
227	4:29:59	4:30:1	IY go to a lake 
229	4:30:58	4:31:7	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
239	4:38:18	4:38:26	do IY go by the plane crash 
244	4:49:15	4:49:20	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
247	4:51:25	4:51:30	ok
249	4:51:54	4:51:55	ok
253	4:56:11	4:56:15	ok
258	5:6:16	5:6:25	ok
262	5:12:13	5:12:17	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
263	5:12:25	5:12:27	yeah 
264	5:12:51	5:12:52	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
265	5:14:40	5:14:46	ok
269	5:17:20	5:17:24	ok
275	5:24:14	5:24:15	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
284	5:36:34	5:36:34	and to the right 
285	5:38:52	5:38:56	to the left
287	5:42:13	5:42:16	IY ve a plane crash though
290	5:45:13	5:45:22	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
298	5:50:34	5:50:40	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
301	5:52:22	5:52:24	uhm IY
302	5:53:41	5:53:42	ok
303	5:57:41	5:57:41	ok
306	6:3:28	6:3:29	ok
312	6:7:10	6:7:18	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
316	6:16:23	6:16:27	around the top of the lake 
317	6:17:17	6:17:25	to the right 
318	6:17:37	6:17:37	mm hmm
326	6:29:21	6:29:28	so wait

340	6:51:5	6:51:8	ok
341	6:51:22	6:51:29	to the left of the antelope
start g
0	0:2:4	0:2:6	and then IY go
1	0:3:45	0:3:49	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
2	0:3:50	0:3:50	so IY re at the hot springs
3	0:4:53	0:4:55	to IY right 
5	0:9:13	0:9:16	ok
7	0:9:50	0:9:52	IY just kind of slope down
10	0:20:27	0:20:29	there s a there s  
11	0:27:46	0:27:49	are IY in like almost the top of the
12	0:28:32	0:28:32	ok 
13	0:29:3	0:29:3	kind of across from stony desert
14	0:29:43	0:29:48	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
16	0:31:1	0:31:4	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
17	0:31:42	0:31:48	three inches
18	0:32:30	0:32:34	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
19	0:33:31	0:33:32	and IY re going up like
20	0:34:28	0:34:35	IY re actually starting like right
21	0:34:48	0:34:53	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
23	0:39:43	0:39:46	and IY just go straight up
25	0:40:8	0:40:9	to the left
26	0:40:44	0:40:51	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
28	0:43:58	0:44:3	ok
31	0:45:11	0:45:15	well
33	0:48:42	0:48:51	ok

39	0:56:57	0:57:6	and then
40	0:59:49	0:59:56	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
41	1:1:43	1:1:46	the slate mountain is towards the right
42	1:2:23	1:2:23	ok
45	1:6:35	1:6:37	like
46	1:6:38	1:6:41	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
47	1:6:50	1:6:57	maybe IY have different things
48	1:7:44	1:7:52	and then
49	1:8:17	1:8:22	ok
50	1:9:52	1:9:55	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
52	1:13:42	1:13:45	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
53	1:14:7	1:14:16	to the lake 
54	1:15:37	1:15:38	uhm
55	1:17:23	1:17:23	and then IY go straight
56	1:18:2	1:18:4	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
57	1:18:54	1:18:58	and then IY re going down
61	1:21:51	1:21:52	so IY go three inches straight
62	1:23:25	1:23:25	a little bit too
63	1:25:8	1:25:15	ok IY plane crash isn t there
64	1:26:30	1:26:37	and there s a plane crash
65	1:26:49	1:26:51	ok well
68	1:28:58	1:29:4	about like
69	1:29:38	1:29:40	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
70	1:30:29	1:30:37	and IY re going straight up
71	1:31:47	1:31:48	after the circle
73	1:35:45	1:35:53	and
74	1:36:4	1:36:10	ok and then IY re going
75	1:37:10	1:37:14	for like
76	1:37:32	1:37:39	no IY don t have any rocks
78	1:44:12	1:44:20	no IY have  
79	1:48:10	1:48:14	it s right next to it
80	1:49:7	1:49:14	ok
81	1:49:30	1:49:33	IY re just going down
82	1:49:38	1:49:47	you
84	1:50:27	1:50:28	and it slopes a little bit to the right
85	1:50:36	1:50:45	and IY go down IY slope to the right
87	1:51:39	1:51:41	ok
88	1:51:54	1:52:1	that s IY little slope
89	1:53:47	1:53:56	they re there
90	1:55:18	1:55:19	and then
91	1:55:28	1:55:32	on IY sheet anyway
93	1:59:54	2:0:2	and then IY slope up
94	2:2:50	2:2:59	IY wanna kind of curve
95	2:4:58	2:5:6	like IY re sloping
96	2:5:28	2:5:30	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
97	2:5:40	2:5:42	uhm
99	2:7:23	2:7:23	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
101	2:8:5	2:8:7	uhm
102	2:8:56	2:8:56	for like
106	2:13:6	2:13:7	like
107	2:13:32	2:13:35	so that s about IY would say

111	2:19:1	2:19:10	alright alright well just
113	2:20:20	2:20:22	to the white mountain
114	2:20:18	2:20:25	to the left
115	2:22:4	2:22:11	uhm
117	2:26:24	2:26:32	IY move to the left
118	2:26:44	2:26:45	is the plane crash  
119	2:27:44	2:27:53	and IY re sloping to the left
120	2:28:15	2:28:22	uhm
125	2:33:58	2:34:6	like maybe an inch
127	2:36:40	2:36:41	three inches
128	2:36:41	2:36:49	yes
129	2:37:25	2:37:26	ok
131	2:39:3	2:39:8	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
133	2:40:37	2:40:40	well
134	2:40:42	2:40:49	then
135	2:41:31	2:41:35	alright 
136	2:43:4	2:43:13	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
137	2:43:46	2:43:51	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
138	2:44:8	2:44:10	yes
139	2:44:37	2:44:39	and then
140	2:45:40	2:45:44	ok
141	2:48:13	2:48:19	are IY anywere near there 
146	2:54:52	2:55:1	it s not a big curve
147	2:55:9	2:55:18	are IY  
149	2:58:51	2:58:52	like
150	2:59:16	2:59:18	couple inches IY re sloping down
151	2:59:40	2:59:44	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
152	3:1:14	3:1:14	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
154	3:1:58	3:2:2	just do it like this ok
155	3:4:7	3:4:8	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
156	3:5:33	3:5:38	to the left
158	3:6:42	3:6:50	like
159	3:8:12	3:8:13	maybe four inches on the paper
160	3:8:43	3:8:48	so
161	3:10:19	3:10:24	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
162	3:11:35	3:11:43	ok
163	3:12:18	3:12:26	that s about five or six inches
164	3:13:27	3:13:29	and then
165	3:15:20	3:15:23	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
166	3:15:46	3:15:47	IY re kind of going  
167	3:17:6	3:17:9	uhm
168	3:21:33	3:21:38	are IY anywhere near there 
169	3:25:18	3:25:18	and then IY slope down to the left
171	3:26:6	3:26:12	like an inch
172	3:26:52	3:27:0	uhm
173	3:27:30	3:27:35	uh like
174	3:28:16	3:28:24	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
176	3:30:47	3:30:48	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
177	3:33:33	3:33:33	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
178	3:34:44	3:34:45	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
179	3:35:25	3:35:31	and then IY slope
180	3:35:58	3:36:2	maybe
182	3:37:12	3:37:20	IY make
183	3:38:27	3:38:36	what 
184	3:38:56	3:39:2	ok
185	3:39:55	3:40:0	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
186	3:39:55	3:40:4	where IY re going down to a plane crash
188	3:42:21	3:42:21	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
190	3:44:10	3:44:11	IY plane crash 
191	3:44:8	3:44:13	IY don t know
192	3:44:29	3:44:30	couple miles or something
193	3:45:9	3:45:13	uhm
194	3:46:38	3:46:38	just a slight slope
195	3:46:56	3:47:0	IY go straight down
196	3:47:53	3:47:56	so IY make that circle
197	3:48:58	3:49:4	uhm
198	3:50:29	3:50:29	uhm
199	3:54:20	3:54:22	well just
200	3:54:46	3:54:52	but
201	3:55:37	3:55:40	ok IY re at the savannah
203	3:56:14	3:56:14	a quarter of an inch
204	3:56:17	3:56:21	and then
206	3:59:14	3:59:18	after plane crash
209	4:4:43	4:4:47	like three inches 
210	4:5:11	4:5:12	ok
212	4:6:8	4:6:12	slight
216	4:9:46	4:9:50	ok
217	4:10:20	4:10:23	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
218	4:11:46	4:11:51	and IY should have a straight line there
219	4:12:54	4:12:54	and then
220	4:12:56	4:13:4	ok
221	4:14:22	4:14:27	from

225	4:26:33	4:26:36	ok
226	4:27:24	4:27:29	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
228	4:30:12	4:30:16	and is to the left
230	4:31:37	4:31:39	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
231	4:31:53	4:31:54	after IY slope down IY d say
232	4:33:42	4:33:46	uhm and there is a stony desert
233	4:33:58	4:34:0	around the bottom of it
234	4:35:13	4:35:18	ok
235	4:35:16	4:35:18	go up like three  three and a half inches
236	4:37:31	4:37:39	are IY in like   
237	4:37:47	4:37:53	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
238	4:38:10	4:38:17	no
240	4:38:59	4:39:4	ok
241	4:42:32	4:42:34	alright well IY ll keep going and see
242	4:43:12	4:43:18	and then IY ll come to a savannah
243	4:46:19	4:46:22	IY re starting at the stony desert
245	4:49:19	4:49:27	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
246	4:49:57	4:50:5	IY re starting
248	4:51:30	4:51:36	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
250	4:52:11	4:52:15	ok
251	4:54:47	4:54:53	IY got that 
252	4:55:46	4:55:49	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
254	5:0:18	5:0:24	IY re sloping
255	5:1:54	5:2:2	uhm
256	5:4:30	5:4:38	uhm
257	5:5:15	5:5:15	a little
259	5:6:59	5:7:1	to the right
260	5:10:3	5:10:6	do IY have roman baths 
261	5:11:34	5:11:38	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
266	5:15:16	5:15:17	straight up
267	5:15:25	5:15:25	have a s 
268	5:17:6	5:17:15	for about two inches
270	5:19:6	5:19:10	what 
271	5:19:49	5:19:57	alright 
272	5:21:27	5:21:32	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
273	5:22:19	5:22:26	and then IY  IY go up
274	5:23:52	5:23:54	ok
276	5:24:28	5:24:33	ok
277	5:25:58	5:26:5	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
278	5:28:20	5:28:20	uhm
279	5:31:37	5:31:46	and that s where the plane crash is
280	5:31:51	5:31:51	IY would say
281	5:32:10	5:32:16	uhm
282	5:33:46	5:33:47	not right at the stony desert
283	5:34:18	5:34:23	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
286	5:40:34	5:40:36	maybe like
288	5:43:7	5:43:8	probably the same thing
289	5:44:2	5:44:8	IY slope down again
291	5:45:17	5:45:25	five
292	5:46:31	5:46:40	three inches straight across
293	5:47:39	5:47:40	and 
294	5:47:44	5:47:50	ok
295	5:48:27	5:48:36	no IY don t have a waterhole
296	5:49:10	5:49:13	ok
297	5:50:21	5:50:28	no
299	5:50:57	5:51:3	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
300	5:51:48	5:51:57	alright are IY starting  near the  
304	5:59:18	5:59:21	like four or five inches to the left
305	6:2:31	6:2:39	so anyway
307	6:4:30	6:4:31	IY re going like
308	6:5:49	6:5:50	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
309	6:5:53	6:5:54	and then
310	6:6:30	6:6:35	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
311	6:6:54	6:7:2	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
313	6:13:11	6:13:18	an inch maybe a little bit less
314	6:14:39	6:14:43	and IY go to the left a little bit
315	6:15:3	6:15:7	ok
319	6:18:12	6:18:19	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
320	6:19:12	6:19:13	four or five inches to the left
321	6:22:4	6:22:11	IY re at the plane crash
322	6:23:2	6:23:8	and IY slope is about an inch long
323	6:25:59	6:26:7	IY re going about
