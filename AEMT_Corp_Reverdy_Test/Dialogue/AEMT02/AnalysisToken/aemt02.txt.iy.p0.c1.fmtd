01:01:01	1:2:25	f					ok
1:2:25	1:4:20	g					ok
1:4:20	1:5:27	g					IY re starting
1:5:27	1:7:19	g					uhm and there is a stony desert
1:7:19	1:8:8	g					IY re actually starting like right
1:8:8	1:8:24	g					uhm
1:8:24	1:10:5	g					kind of across from stony desert
1:10:5	1:11:36	g					and
1:11:36	1:13:19	g					IY re kind of going  
1:13:19	1:15:14	g					IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
1:15:14	1:15:21	g					and IY re going
1:15:21	1:17:14	g					IY would say
1:17:14	1:19:3	g					maybe
1:19:3	1:20:6	g					couple miles or something
1:20:6	1:21:51	g					from
1:21:51	1:23:32	g					uhm
1:23:32	1:24:16	g					where IY re going down to a plane crash
1:24:16	1:24:50	g					uhm
1:24:50	1:26:44	g					there s a there s  
1:26:44	1:28:14	f					ok wait hold on
1:28:14	1:28:56	g					ok
1:28:56	1:30:8	f					IY have to back up a little bit
1:30:8	1:30:45	g					ok
1:30:45	1:31:8	g					so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
1:31:8	1:31:52	f					ok
1:31:52	1:33:7	g					and IY go to the left a little bit
1:33:7	1:34:53	g					and then
1:34:53	1:36:22	g					uhm
1:36:22	1:37:38	g					IY just kind of slope down
1:37:38	1:38:58	g					a little bit too
1:38:58	1:40:12	g					and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
1:40:12	1:41:12	g					after IY slope down IY d say
1:41:12	1:42:18	g					like
1:42:18	1:42:57	g					maybe like
1:42:57	1:44:3	g					couple inches IY re sloping down
1:44:3	1:45:1	g					and then IY go straight
1:45:1	1:45:36	g					for like
1:45:36	1:47:10	g					like
1:47:10	1:49:5	g					five
1:49:5	1:50:46	g					maybe four inches on the paper
1:50:46	1:51:42	g					and there s a plane crash
1:51:42	1:51:51	f					uhm IY
1:51:51	1:53:13	f					uh IY don t know know what to say
1:53:13	1:54:55	f					IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
1:54:55	1:56:18	f					it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
1:56:18	1:56:56	g					IY plane crash 
1:56:56	1:57:11	f					mm  mm
1:57:11	1:57:56	g					uhm
1:57:56	1:58:28	g					alright are IY starting  near the  
1:58:28	2:0:18	f					IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
2:0:18	2:2:7	g					are IY  
2:2:7	2:2:57	g					IY re starting at the stony desert
2:2:57	2:4:13	f					yeah
2:4:13	2:5:6	g					ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
2:5:6	2:6:43	f					and
2:6:43	2:8:33	g					like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
2:8:33	2:10:10	g					not right at the stony desert
2:10:10	2:11:23	f					yeah 
2:11:23	2:12:13	g					ok and then IY re going
2:12:13	2:13:1	f					ok
2:13:1	2:14:4	g					to the left
2:14:4	2:15:1	g					like an inch
2:15:1	2:16:23	g					and then IY re going down
2:16:23	2:17:39	g					like maybe an inch
2:17:39	2:18:25	g					that s IY little slope
2:18:25	2:20:21	f					ok
2:20:21	2:21:57	g					and then IY go
2:21:57	2:22:49	g					like four or five inches to the left
2:22:49	2:24:9	g					and that s where the plane crash is
2:24:9	2:26:7	g					are IY anywhere near there 
2:26:7	2:27:31	f					IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
2:27:31	2:28:44	f					so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
2:28:44	2:29:38	g					four or five inches to the left
2:29:38	2:29:38	f					ok
2:29:38	2:31:9	g					and then
2:31:9	2:32:0	g					after plane crash
2:32:0	2:33:23	f					am IY supposed to start at the same place 
2:33:23	2:34:42	f					ok
2:34:42	2:36:10	g					ok IY plane crash isn t there
2:36:10	2:36:27	g					uhm
2:36:27	2:38:9	g					alright well IY ll keep going and see
2:38:9	2:39:43	g					alright 
2:39:43	2:40:40	g					so
2:40:40	2:42:22	g					uhm
2:42:22	2:43:48	g					IY re at the plane crash
2:43:48	2:45:19	g					and
2:45:19	2:46:0	g					IY wanna kind of curve
2:46:0	2:46:54	g					a little
2:46:54	2:47:3	g					to the left
2:47:3	2:48:22	g					and then IY  IY go up
2:48:22	2:50:11	g					and IY re going up like
2:50:11	2:51:44	g					three inches
2:51:44	2:53:41	f					mm hmm
2:53:41	2:55:4	g					and 
2:55:4	2:55:32	g					in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
2:55:32	2:56:20	g					it s not a big curve
2:56:20	2:57:59	f					ok
2:57:59	2:58:36	g					ok
2:58:36	2:59:59	g					and then
2:59:59	3:0:11	g					uhm
3:0:11	3:2:7	g					after that IY go straight again
3:2:7	3:2:53	g					aways about like four inches  four or five inches
3:2:53	3:4:33	g					and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
3:4:33	3:6:30	g					are IY anywere near there 
3:6:30	3:6:48	f					yeah IY see that
3:6:48	3:7:10	g					ok
3:7:10	3:7:22	f					so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
3:7:22	3:8:26	g					yes
3:8:26	3:9:14	f					and there s a collapsed shelter
3:9:14	3:10:8	g					yes
3:10:8	3:10:8	f					ok
3:10:8	3:12:5	g					ok
3:12:5	3:14:4	g					now IY re at the collapsed shelter
3:14:4	3:14:53	g					and IY go down IY slope to the right
3:14:53	3:15:22	g					just a slight slope
3:15:22	3:15:36	g					about like
3:15:36	3:17:21	g					an inch maybe a little bit less
3:17:21	3:17:34	f					to the right 
3:17:34	3:18:20	g					to the right
3:18:20	3:19:46	g					IY re sloping
3:19:46	3:21:10	f					ok
3:21:10	3:22:41	f					and then what 
3:22:41	3:24:32	g					ok
3:24:32	3:26:25	g					and then
3:26:25	3:28:9	g					you
3:28:9	3:28:57	g					have a s 
3:28:57	3:29:42	g					IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
3:29:42	3:30:41	g					it s like a slight little upwards to the right
3:30:41	3:31:29	f					mm hmm
3:31:29	3:32:44	g					slight
3:32:44	3:33:30	g					uhm
3:33:30	3:34:35	g					and then IY ll come to a savannah
3:34:35	3:35:31	f					ok
3:35:31	3:37:17	g					ok
3:37:17	3:37:51	f					so IY pass a waterhole or no 
3:37:51	3:38:52	g					uhhh no
3:38:52	3:40:38	g					no IY don t have a waterhole
3:40:38	3:42:0	g					IY have a waterhole on IY map 
3:42:0	3:43:31	f					yeah
3:43:31	3:45:16	g					well
3:45:16	3:45:42	g					alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
3:45:42	3:45:59	f					yeah 
3:45:59	3:47:36	g					ok
3:47:36	3:48:29	f					 IY m at the savannah
3:48:29	3:49:34	g					ok IY re at the savannah
3:49:34	3:49:40	g					now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
3:49:40	3:50:29	g					like
3:50:29	3:52:19	g					three inches
3:52:19	3:54:10	f					ok
3:54:10	3:55:26	g					and IY re going straight up
3:55:26	3:56:13	g					and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
3:56:13	3:57:26	f					nope IY have a white mountain
3:57:26	3:58:35	g					ok well
3:58:35	3:58:41	g					probably the same thing
3:58:41	4:0:32	f					but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
4:0:32	4:1:27	f					to the left
4:1:27	4:3:8	g					where are IY right now   start at the savannah
4:3:8	4:3:29	f					yeah and IY went straight up
4:3:29	4:4:9	g					straight up
4:4:9	4:4:35	f					and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
4:4:35	4:5:41	g					hmm
4:5:41	4:6:8	g					well
4:6:8	4:6:52	g					IY don t know
4:6:52	4:8:6	g					alright 
4:8:6	4:8:48	g					well just
4:8:48	4:10:46	f					am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
4:10:46	4:12:3	g					oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
4:12:3	4:12:24	g					the slate mountain is towards the right
4:12:24	4:13:24	g					the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
4:13:24	4:14:13	g					are IY in like   
4:14:13	4:14:56	g					are IY in like almost the top of the
4:14:56	4:15:55	f					IY m three inches above the savannah
4:15:55	4:16:25	g					no IY have  
4:16:25	4:17:36	g					maybe IY have different things
4:17:36	4:17:46	g					well alright
4:17:46	4:18:21	f					IY know IY have different things so
4:18:21	4:19:58	g					alright alright well just
4:19:58	4:20:28	g					just do it like this ok
4:20:28	4:21:24	g					go up like three  three and a half inches
4:21:24	4:21:47	f					and curve down to the left 
4:21:47	4:22:49	g					and curve to  not down just curve to the left
4:22:49	4:23:25	f					curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
4:23:25	4:24:8	g					it s right next to it
4:24:8	4:24:15	g					it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
4:24:15	4:25:56	f					how many inches do IY think 
4:25:56	4:27:46	g					maybe like
4:27:46	4:29:39	g					a quarter of an inch
4:29:39	4:30:39	g					to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
4:30:39	4:30:53	f					oh
4:30:53	4:31:48	f					ok
4:31:48	4:32:6	g					ok
4:32:6	4:32:49	g					and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
4:32:49	4:33:18	g					for like
4:33:18	4:34:14	g					maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
4:34:14	4:36:0	f					yeah
4:36:0	4:36:32	g					and then IY slope down to the left
4:36:32	4:38:27	g					and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
4:38:27	4:38:28	f					mm hmm
4:38:28	4:39:13	g					ok
4:39:13	4:41:7	g					and then
4:41:7	4:41:34	g					as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
4:41:34	4:42:7	f					no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
4:42:7	4:43:40	g					ok
4:43:40	4:45:13	g					so IY re at the hot springs
4:45:13	4:46:46	g					and IY re sloping to the left
4:46:46	4:46:50	g					and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
4:46:50	4:47:51	f					mm hmm
4:47:51	4:49:35	g					ok
4:49:35	4:49:46	g					and then
4:49:46	4:50:40	g					uhm
4:50:40	4:52:26	g					IY slope down again
4:52:26	4:52:57	f					elephants 
4:52:57	4:54:41	g					uhm
4:54:41	4:55:18	g					no there s no elephants
4:55:18	4:55:47	g					on IY sheet anyway
4:55:47	4:56:28	f					ok
4:56:28	4:57:21	f					do IY hit anything when IY go down 
4:57:21	4:58:12	g					no
4:58:12	5:0:7	g					IY re just going down
5:0:7	5:1:34	g					like IY re sloping
5:1:34	5:1:59	g					and IY slope is about an inch long
5:1:59	5:2:22	g					and is to the left
5:2:22	5:4:15	f					ok
5:4:15	5:4:50	g					ok
5:4:50	5:4:52	g					and then
5:4:52	5:5:8	g					uhm
5:5:8	5:6:14	g					IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
5:6:14	5:7:23	g					to the left
5:7:23	5:8:25	f					ok
5:8:25	5:10:9	g					ok
5:10:9	5:10:16	g					and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
5:10:16	5:11:58	f					to 
5:11:58	5:12:59	g					to the white mountain
5:12:59	5:14:52	f					ok
5:14:52	5:16:28	g					ok 
5:16:28	5:17:3	g					so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
5:17:3	5:18:53	g					and it slopes a little bit to the right
5:18:53	5:20:2	g					but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
5:20:2	5:21:55	f					ok
5:21:55	5:21:56	g					ok
5:21:56	5:23:24	g					so that s about IY would say
5:23:24	5:24:0	g					that s about five or six inches
5:24:0	5:24:49	f					mm hmm
5:24:49	5:26:45	g					ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
5:26:45	5:27:10	f					mm hmm
5:27:10	5:27:34	g					uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
5:27:34	5:28:55	g					and IY just go straight up
5:28:55	5:30:40	g					for about two inches
5:30:40	5:32:13	g					ok
5:32:13	5:33:6	f					yep
5:33:6	5:33:58	g					then
5:33:58	5:34:34	f					IY hit some round rocks
5:34:34	5:35:1	g					no IY don t have any rocks
5:35:1	5:35:46	f					ok
5:35:46	5:36:9	g					ok
5:36:9	5:37:39	f					IY hit some rocks though
5:37:39	5:38:59	g					ok
5:38:59	5:40:32	g					uhm
5:40:32	5:42:19	g					and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
5:42:19	5:42:43	g					and then IY slope
5:42:43	5:42:43	g					well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
5:42:43	5:44:0	f					IY go to a lake 
5:44:0	5:44:33	g					yes IY re going towards the lake
5:44:33	5:45:53	f					ok
5:45:53	5:46:18	g					but
5:46:18	5:47:21	g					IY re going about
5:47:21	5:47:48	g					three inches straight across
5:47:48	5:47:55	g					to the lake 
5:47:55	5:48:0	g					and then IY are
5:48:0	5:49:39	g					IY got that 
5:49:39	5:49:51	f					do IY go through anything 
5:49:51	5:51:35	g					uhm
5:51:35	5:51:55	g					no
5:51:55	5:52:4	g					IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
5:52:4	5:52:48	g					so IY go three inches straight
5:52:48	5:53:36	g					and then IY slope up
5:53:36	5:54:55	g					and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
5:54:55	5:55:20	f					around the lake to the top 
5:55:20	5:56:36	g					the  
5:56:36	5:56:54	g					what 
5:56:54	5:57:4	f					around the top of the lake 
5:57:4	5:57:9	g					yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
5:57:9	5:58:16	f					ok
5:58:16	5:59:18	g					ok
5:59:18	6:1:15	g					and then
6:1:15	6:2:51	g					uhm
6:2:51	6:3:41	g					right next to IY circle should be roman baths
6:3:41	6:5:29	g					do IY have roman baths 
6:5:29	6:6:6	f					nope
6:6:6	6:6:45	g					ok well
6:6:45	6:6:56	g					they re there
6:6:56	6:7:53	g					so anyway
6:7:53	6:9:5	g					IY make
6:9:5	6:10:34	f					IY ve a plane crash though
6:10:34	6:11:43	g					what 
6:11:43	6:12:8	f					IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
6:12:8	6:13:31	g					yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
6:13:31	6:15:2	g					so IY make that circle
6:15:2	6:16:39	f					ok
6:16:39	6:18:9	f					yeah
6:18:9	6:18:52	g					and 
6:18:52	6:18:53	g					after the circle
6:18:53	6:20:50	g					uhm
6:20:50	6:21:24	g					IY move to the left
6:21:24	6:22:23	g					so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
6:22:23	6:23:46	f					ok
6:23:46	6:24:49	g					and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
6:24:49	6:26:5	g					like three inches 
6:26:5	6:27:48	g					and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
6:27:48	6:28:12	f					yeah
