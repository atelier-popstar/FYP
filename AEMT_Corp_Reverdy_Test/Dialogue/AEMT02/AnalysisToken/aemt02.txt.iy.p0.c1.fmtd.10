0:0:48	0:0:56	g	197	56			ok
0:1:2	0:1:5	g	288	65			alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
0:1:19	0:1:22	f	275	82			and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
0:1:44	0:1:51	g	181	111			well
0:3:8	0:3:13	f	186	193			ok
0:3:46	0:3:48	f	121	228			ok
0:4:20	0:4:22	g	341	262			IY have a waterhole on IY map 
0:4:39	0:4:44	g	157	284			no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
0:4:36	0:4:44	g	210	284			now IY re at the collapsed shelter
0:7:3	0:7:12	f	280	432			IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
0:11:11	0:11:19	g	37	679			uhm
0:12:19	0:12:19	g	199	739			and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
0:12:26	0:12:29	g	22	749			aways about like four inches  four or five inches
0:13:28	0:13:37	g	222	817			ok IY re at the savannah
0:15:2	0:15:3	f	155	903			do IY go through anything 
0:15:5	0:15:14	g	342	914			ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
0:15:22	0:15:30	g	92	930			to the left
0:18:26	0:18:27	g	25	1107			it s not a big curve
0:19:24	0:19:26	g	282	1166			IY re starting at the stony desert
0:19:24	0:19:27	f	281	1167			do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
0:19:59	0:20:1	g	334	1201			like
0:22:27	0:22:32	g	332	1352			and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
0:25:10	0:25:15	f	35	1515			ok
0:25:57	0:25:58	f	247	1558			ok
0:26:55	0:26:58	g	20	1618			and then
0:28:44	0:28:51	g	166	1731			maybe
0:30:48	0:30:53	g	15	1853			no IY have  
0:32:3	0:32:7	g	140	1927			are IY  
0:32:36	0:32:44	f	252	1964			and then what 
0:34:40	0:34:48	f	294	2088			nope IY have a white mountain
0:35:29	0:35:38	g	224	2138			well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
0:35:52	0:35:56	g	96	2156			that s about five or six inches
0:36:55	0:36:56	g	173	2216			no IY don t have a waterhole
0:36:55	0:37:1	g	266	2221			uhm
0:37:1	0:37:8	f	9	2228			yeah IY see that
0:37:12	0:37:17	g	307	2237			to IY right 
0:37:42	0:37:43	f	127	2263			ok
0:40:35	0:40:36	g	49	2436			ok
0:41:10	0:41:11	g	244	2471			so IY make that circle
0:44:30	0:44:31	g	79	2671			slight
0:44:34	0:44:43	g	318	2683			so IY go three inches straight
0:44:53	0:44:54	g	90	2694			they re there
0:45:7	0:45:14	g	311	2714			an inch maybe a little bit less
0:46:9	0:46:12	g	55	2772			ok
0:47:40	0:47:42	g	46	2862			ok
0:51:51	0:51:58	g	38	3118			and then
0:55:7	0:55:10	f	248	3310			IY hit some round rocks
0:55:39	0:55:46	g	256	3346			well just
0:59:33	0:59:34	f	267	3574			ok
1:1:2	1:1:4	g	214	3664			four or five inches to the left
1:2:5	1:2:5	f	94	3725			mm hmm
1:2:19	1:2:22	f	245	3742			 IY m at the savannah
1:2:32	1:2:36	g	205	3756			ok
1:3:13	1:3:18	f	24	3798			am IY supposed to start at the same place 
1:5:25	1:5:31	f	91	3931			ok
1:9:2	1:9:3	g	190	4143			and then
1:9:34	1:9:36	g	27	4176			and then IY go straight
1:9:54	1:9:58	g	292	4198			uhm
1:10:1	1:10:7	f	195	4207			around the top of the lake 
1:11:58	1:12:6	g	257	4326			IY re sloping
1:12:55	1:13:2	g	153	4382			and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
1:13:14	1:13:18	g	50	4398			ok
1:13:27	1:13:30	g	223	4410			after that IY go straight again
1:15:19	1:15:24	f	33	4524			ok
1:15:21	1:15:27	g	193	4527			three inches
1:16:5	1:16:11	f	56	4571			and curve down to the left 
1:19:22	1:19:27	g	198	4767			and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
1:19:29	1:19:30	g	42	4770			like an inch
1:21:24	1:21:28	g	89	4888			there s a there s  
1:23:50	1:23:57	f	300	5037			to 
1:24:19	1:24:22	f	54	5062			IY ve a plane crash though
1:25:33	1:25:35	f	107	5135			elephants 
1:26:12	1:26:19	g	78	5179			and then
1:26:49	1:26:56	f	206	5216			ok
1:27:45	1:27:50	g	132	5270			ok
1:28:21	1:28:22	g	104	5302			to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
1:29:43	1:29:46	f	101	5386			do IY go by the plane crash 
1:30:56	1:30:59	g	48	5459			no
1:31:50	1:31:55	g	80	5515			IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
1:32:51	1:32:59	g	187	5579			and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
1:33:44	1:33:52	g	28	5632			IY wanna kind of curve
1:35:47	1:35:47	g	60	5747			and IY just go straight up
1:36:16	1:36:23	g	330	5783			just a slight slope
1:36:18	1:36:27	f	221	5787			ok
1:36:30	1:36:32	g	216	5792			uhm
1:37:44	1:37:53	g	147	5873			and then
1:38:30	1:38:35	g	110	5915			and it slopes a little bit to the right
1:39:22	1:39:31	g	52	5971			and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
1:40:27	1:40:28	g	10	6028			not right at the stony desert
1:46:1	1:46:2	g	135	6362			IY re actually starting like right
1:46:19	1:46:19	g	240	6379			now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
1:46:29	1:46:38	f	73	6398			am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
1:46:31	1:46:40	g	99	6400			ok
1:46:46	1:46:52	g	236	6412			about like
1:47:46	1:47:48	g	13	6468			are IY in like almost the top of the
1:48:24	1:48:31	g	97	6511			and then
1:51:45	1:51:50	g	301	6710			yes
1:52:2	1:52:8	g	208	6728			from
1:53:45	1:53:50	g	103	6830			ok well
1:55:36	1:55:39	g	152	6939			maybe like
1:57:11	1:57:13	g	114	7033			uhm
1:57:56	1:58:3	g	81	7083			ok
2:3:10	2:3:12	g	253	7392			uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
2:4:6	2:4:9	g	124	7449			IY re going about
2:4:13	2:4:22	g	227	7462			maybe IY have different things
2:5:48	2:5:48	g	108	7548			maybe four inches on the paper
2:6:15	2:6:19	g	178	7579			so that s about IY would say
2:6:52	2:7:0	g	237	7620			and IY re going straight up
2:9:1	2:9:6	g	246	7746			like four or five inches to the left
2:9:36	2:9:44	f	105	7784			mm hmm
2:9:49	2:9:54	g	250	7794			so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
2:10:36	2:10:40	g	321	7840			for about two inches
2:10:43	2:10:47	g	309	7847			IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
2:11:16	2:11:18	g	53	7878			where are IY right now   start at the savannah
2:12:1	2:12:9	g	160	7929			yes
2:13:1	2:13:4	g	265	7984			uhm and there is a stony desert
2:14:15	2:14:22	g	242	8062			the  
2:15:32	2:15:39	g	75	8139			so IY re at the hot springs
2:15:43	2:15:50	f	215	8150			no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
2:16:33	2:16:36	f	31	8196			yeah
2:18:9	2:18:15	f	218	8295			around the lake to the top 
2:19:44	2:19:45	f	225	8385			but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
2:20:16	2:20:22	g	119	8422			IY make
2:21:57	2:22:5	f	263	8525			mm hmm
2:22:40	2:22:41	g	239	8561			oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
2:24:4	2:24:6	f	277	8646			ok
2:24:57	2:25:0	g	26	8700			hmm

2:30:47	2:30:50	g	63	9050			yes IY re going towards the lake
2:30:51	2:30:53	g	303	9053			uhm
2:32:52	2:32:59	g	238	9179			IY plane crash 
2:34:47	2:34:48	g	232	9288			uhm
2:36:19	2:36:27	g	202	9387			so
2:36:44	2:36:47	g	17	9407			no
2:38:7	2:38:13	g	100	9493			to the left
2:38:22	2:38:31	g	340	9511			but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
2:38:57	2:38:58	g	306	9538			well
2:38:59	2:39:5	g	3	9545			like IY re sloping
2:39:6	2:39:14	g	123	9554			what 
2:39:30	2:39:36	f	74	9576			so wait
2:39:55	2:40:4	g	293	9604			for like

2:44:4	2:44:13	g	261	9853			a little
2:44:51	2:44:52	f	287	9892			how many inches do IY think 
2:45:7	2:45:8	g	337	9908			so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
2:45:32	2:45:33	g	118	9933			the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
2:46:51	2:46:51	g	322	10011			have a s 
2:48:7	2:48:12	g	93	10092			alright alright well just

2:49:44	2:49:46	g	138	10186			uhm
2:51:26	2:51:35	g	136	10295			after plane crash
2:52:40	2:52:42	f	161	10362			so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
2:55:24	2:55:32	g	64	10532			uhhh no
2:55:51	2:55:57	g	219	10557			and then IY slope up
2:58:9	2:58:16	g	8	10696			and then
2:59:9	2:59:13	g	175	10753			like maybe an inch

3:14:43	3:14:43	g	314	11683			and that s where the plane crash is
3:14:49	3:14:52	g	4	11692			and is to the left
3:15:48	3:15:54	g	194	11754			uhm

3:24:52	3:24:58	g	278	12298			and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
3:25:9	3:25:16	g	258	12316			for like
3:27:1	3:27:1	g	174	12421			ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
3:27:11	3:27:13	g	14	12433			ok
3:27:14	3:27:21	g	44	12441			and

3:40:41	3:40:42	g	39	13242			where IY re going down to a plane crash
3:41:42	3:41:50	g	200	13310			couple inches IY re sloping down
3:42:10	3:42:12	g	255	13332			uhm

4:6:19	4:6:25	f	144	14785			so IY go to the left of the antelope
4:7:4	4:7:8	f	66	14828			ok
4:8:0	4:8:7	g	212	14887			and then IY slope
4:8:21	4:8:28	g	251	14908			ok

4:19:4	4:19:5	g	70	15545			it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
4:19:44	4:19:47	g	51	15587			like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
4:20:29	4:20:30	g	65	15630			uhm
