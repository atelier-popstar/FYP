1	0:3:30	0:3:30	what 
2	0:3:31	0:3:35	ok
3	0:3:54	0:3:57	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
5	0:5:15	0:5:17	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
6	0:6:18	0:6:22	the  
7	0:7:37	0:7:39	ok
8	0:8:15	0:8:23	IY re just going down
10	0:13:13	0:13:14	ok
11	0:13:40	0:13:42	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
13	0:14:54	0:14:58	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
14	0:15:15	0:15:19	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
17	0:17:2	0:17:5	uhm
18	0:18:37	0:18:37	IY re going about
19	0:19:6	0:19:8	no IY have  
20	0:20:42	0:20:44	ok
22	0:23:35	0:23:36	you
23	0:24:56	0:24:59	and then
24	0:25:46	0:25:55	maybe like
26	0:26:41	0:26:44	and then IY slope up
29	0:29:41	0:29:44	and 
30	0:30:58	0:30:59	are IY anywhere near there 
31	0:31:22	0:31:27	and then IY slope
32	0:31:34	0:31:40	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
33	0:32:10	0:32:19	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
34	0:32:34	0:32:35	maybe like
37	0:32:45	0:32:48	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
39	0:35:46	0:35:50	uhm
41	0:37:15	0:37:20	ok well
42	0:39:43	0:39:51	and IY go to the left a little bit
43	0:39:59	0:40:3	IY re starting
44	0:44:27	0:44:29	ok 
47	0:46:5	0:46:14	no IY don t have a waterhole
49	0:52:36	0:52:41	uhm
50	0:55:35	0:55:39	an inch maybe a little bit less
51	0:59:31	0:59:37	and then IY re going down
52	1:0:6	1:0:15	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
53	1:0:38	1:0:40	for about two inches
54	1:1:41	1:1:47	yes
55	1:2:4	1:2:8	is the plane crash  
56	1:3:17	1:3:19	ok
57	1:4:10	1:4:12	where IY re going down to a plane crash
59	1:6:15	1:6:19	and then
60	1:7:36	1:7:36	ok
61	1:8:10	1:8:16	and it slopes a little bit to the right
62	1:10:8	1:10:16	ok
63	1:10:56	1:10:58	ok
64	1:11:31	1:11:34	a little bit too
67	1:16:5	1:16:9	no
68	1:17:47	1:17:53	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
70	1:19:2	1:19:4	are IY anywere near there 
72	1:21:0	1:21:9	uhhh no
74	1:22:1	1:22:2	to the left
75	1:23:38	1:23:42	IY plane crash 
76	1:25:44	1:25:52	and then IY slope down to the left
78	1:30:33	1:30:33	just do it like this ok
80	1:31:33	1:31:40	uhm
81	1:33:33	1:33:33	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
82	1:33:46	1:33:46	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
83	1:36:27	1:36:34	and then IY go
86	1:41:53	1:42:1	three inches
87	1:42:54	1:42:57	yes IY re going towards the lake
88	1:46:48	1:46:52	IY would say
91	1:51:24	1:51:33	and then
92	1:52:50	1:52:53	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
93	1:53:14	1:53:17	uhm
95	1:53:46	1:53:52	uhm
96	1:54:29	1:54:29	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
98	1:54:38	1:54:38	and then IY ll come to a savannah
99	1:55:14	1:55:21	have a s 
100	1:55:29	1:55:38	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
101	1:56:7	1:56:13	like three inches 
102	1:56:28	1:56:33	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
103	1:57:16	1:57:20	like
104	1:58:53	1:58:58	like
105	1:59:12	1:59:12	ok
106	1:59:8	1:59:16	so that s about IY would say
107	2:2:18	2:2:18	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
108	2:4:35	2:4:42	to IY right 
109	2:7:3	2:7:6	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
114	2:14:39	2:14:43	ok
115	2:14:54	2:14:59	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
116	2:15:46	2:15:50	and then IY go straight
118	2:20:36	2:20:37	there s a there s  
119	2:22:28	2:22:28	are IY in like   
121	2:25:29	2:25:31	ok
123	2:28:36	2:28:43	a little
124	2:28:50	2:28:55	around the bottom of it
126	2:31:30	2:31:32	like maybe an inch
127	2:34:4	2:34:4	and there s a plane crash
128	2:35:26	2:35:35	IY go straight down
129	2:36:19	2:36:19	IY re kind of going  
130	2:37:41	2:37:46	ok
131	2:39:5	2:39:14	well
132	2:44:15	2:44:23	IY just kind of slope down
133	2:45:51	2:45:58	after that IY go straight again
135	2:53:35	2:53:42	like
136	2:54:2	2:54:11	maybe IY have different things
137	2:54:38	2:54:40	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
138	2:58:50	2:58:54	and then
139	2:59:22	2:59:30	it s right next to it
140	3:0:4	3:0:10	uhm
141	3:0:9	3:0:17	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
142	3:1:35	3:1:41	well alright
143	3:1:42	3:1:47	yes
144	3:1:50	3:1:57	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
145	3:2:14	3:2:23	and IY should have a straight line there
147	3:4:58	3:5:6	uhm
149	3:8:24	3:8:33	and 
150	3:11:1	3:11:4	that s IY little slope
153	3:16:36	3:16:39	and then
154	3:17:44	3:17:49	IY re going like
155	3:17:50	3:17:59	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
156	3:19:25	3:19:26	ok
157	3:22:15	3:22:22	alright well IY ll keep going and see
158	3:24:30	3:24:31	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
160	3:26:50	3:26:57	uhm
161	3:27:22	3:27:30	IY got that 
163	3:29:21	3:29:23	ok IY plane crash isn t there
164	3:29:23	3:29:32	couple inches IY re sloping down
165	3:30:0	3:30:0	ok
166	3:31:2	3:31:9	and that s where the plane crash is
167	3:31:45	3:31:45	and IY just go straight up
168	3:31:49	3:31:56	are IY  
169	3:33:55	3:33:59	couple miles or something
170	3:35:7	3:35:16	IY re sloping
171	3:35:52	3:36:0	uh like
172	3:36:5	3:36:5	IY re at the plane crash
175	3:39:0	3:39:9	like an inch
176	3:39:6	3:39:14	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
177	3:40:29	3:40:30	for like
178	3:41:7	3:41:15	they re there
179	3:42:33	3:42:42	like four or five inches to the left
180	3:43:23	3:43:29	IY don t know
181	3:43:44	3:43:46	the slate mountain is towards the right
182	3:45:26	3:45:27	maybe
184	3:46:5	3:46:6	alright 
185	3:46:33	3:46:35	ok
186	3:49:37	3:49:44	four or five inches to the left
187	3:51:32	3:51:33	kind of across from stony desert
189	3:55:33	3:55:37	ok
191	3:57:14	3:57:22	three inches straight across
192	3:58:12	3:58:18	ok
194	3:59:56	4:0:4	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
195	4:0:4	4:0:12	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
197	4:0:46	4:0:54	ok
198	4:3:54	4:4:1	and IY slope is about an inch long
199	4:4:42	4:4:43	ok
201	4:10:14	4:10:19	and then IY are
202	4:10:41	4:10:43	and then
203	4:10:55	4:10:56	after IY slope down IY d say
204	4:11:5	4:11:10	so IY make that circle
207	4:14:46	4:14:53	and IY re going up like
208	4:15:16	4:15:22	so anyway
210	4:17:9	4:17:9	about like
212	4:18:36	4:18:43	maybe four inches on the paper
213	4:19:38	4:19:41	IY make
214	4:22:42	4:22:50	and IY re sloping to the left
217	4:24:47	4:24:52	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
218	4:27:34	4:27:38	probably the same thing
219	4:29:1	4:29:8	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
220	4:29:32	4:29:36	ok IY re at the savannah
221	4:30:49	4:30:54	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
222	4:31:14	4:31:14	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
223	4:34:40	4:34:47	alright 
224	4:35:6	4:35:12	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
227	4:36:46	4:36:50	uhm
228	4:41:9	4:41:14	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
230	4:43:40	4:43:46	IY re starting at the stony desert
231	4:44:15	4:44:17	what 
232	4:45:44	4:45:47	it s not a big curve
233	4:45:53	4:46:1	five
234	4:47:14	4:47:22	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
236	4:48:8	4:48:14	uhm
237	4:49:44	4:49:48	so
239	4:52:42	4:52:47	are IY in like almost the top of the
240	4:54:58	4:55:1	ok
241	4:55:19	4:55:27	then
242	4:56:1	4:56:2	to the white mountain
243	4:56:39	4:56:48	and IY re going straight up
245	4:59:22	4:59:23	IY slope down again
246	5:1:59	5:2:8	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
247	5:2:8	5:2:12	on IY sheet anyway
248	5:2:45	5:2:47	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
251	5:10:36	5:10:39	so IY go three inches straight
252	5:10:37	5:10:44	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
253	5:12:39	5:12:43	three inches
254	5:13:1	5:13:3	well
256	5:14:33	5:14:39	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
257	5:17:23	5:17:23	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
259	5:20:28	5:20:35	uhm
262	5:30:11	5:30:18	IY re actually starting like right
263	5:30:45	5:30:47	uhm
264	5:31:13	5:31:20	do IY have roman baths 
266	5:34:25	5:34:26	ok and then IY re going
267	5:34:48	5:34:49	from
268	5:34:56	5:35:2	IY wanna kind of curve
269	5:36:43	5:36:44	uhm
270	5:38:3	5:38:5	ok
271	5:38:6	5:38:11	and
274	5:39:47	5:39:53	but
275	5:40:26	5:40:33	to the right
276	5:42:32	5:42:36	and is to the left
278	5:43:54	5:43:56	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
279	5:44:34	5:44:42	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
281	5:47:58	5:48:3	ok
283	5:55:1	5:55:3	to the left
284	5:56:38	5:56:45	no IY don t have any rocks
285	5:57:28	5:57:33	a quarter of an inch
286	5:59:3	5:59:9	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
289	6:3:10	6:3:16	slight
291	6:4:9	6:4:14	to the left
292	6:5:54	6:5:55	uhm and there is a stony desert
293	6:8:33	6:8:41	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
294	6:8:56	6:9:5	not right at the stony desert
295	6:9:56	6:10:4	and then
296	6:10:37	6:10:45	well just
297	6:10:47	6:10:53	uhm
298	6:12:2	6:12:6	IY move to the left

300	6:14:55	6:14:55	uhm
301	6:15:5	6:15:14	for like
302	6:17:11	6:17:16	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
304	6:18:30	6:18:38	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
305	6:21:35	6:21:43	after the circle
306	6:22:24	6:22:33	like IY re sloping
307	6:23:27	6:23:32	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
308	6:24:20	6:24:21	and then IY  IY go up
311	6:26:42	6:26:48	so IY re at the hot springs
312	6:27:12	6:27:17	ok well
313	6:28:9	6:28:14	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
314	6:29:8	6:29:13	alright alright well just
316	6:31:25	6:31:31	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
318	6:32:4	6:32:6	alright are IY starting  near the  
319	6:32:26	6:32:31	go up like three  three and a half inches
320	6:33:56	6:33:59	that s about five or six inches
323	6:36:55	6:36:58	and IY go down IY slope to the right
326	6:38:32	6:38:35	uhm
327	6:38:45	6:38:48	like
328	6:44:12	6:44:15	straight up
329	6:44:18	6:44:18	after plane crash
331	6:48:27	6:48:31	no
332	6:50:43	6:50:49	just a slight slope
333	6:50:44	6:50:52	ok
334	6:51:25	6:51:28	and
338	6:53:8	6:53:10	hmm
340	6:53:42	6:53:44	no there s no elephants
341	6:55:3	6:55:3	to the lake 
342	6:55:59	6:56:0	ok
start f
4	0:4:9	0:4:10	mm hmm
9	0:9:25	0:9:26	 IY m at the savannah
12	0:13:47	0:13:55	ok
15	0:16:16	0:16:18	around the top of the lake 
16	0:16:56	0:17:4	to 
21	0:20:53	0:20:59	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
25	0:26:42	0:26:42	yeah IY see that
27	0:26:54	0:27:0	yeah
28	0:27:56	0:27:59	ok
35	0:32:37	0:32:42	ok
36	0:32:36	0:32:42	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
38	0:35:8	0:35:16	how many inches do IY think 
40	0:36:14	0:36:14	so wait
45	0:44:54	0:45:3	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
46	0:45:58	0:45:58	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
48	0:50:22	0:50:23	ok
58	1:5:36	1:5:45	oh
65	1:12:12	1:12:20	ok

71	1:20:35	1:20:43	uh IY don t know know what to say
73	1:21:13	1:21:15	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
77	1:28:19	1:28:23	do IY go by the plane crash 
79	1:31:11	1:31:12	elephants 
84	1:37:31	1:37:36	ok
85	1:40:21	1:40:28	and there s a collapsed shelter
89	1:46:54	1:46:59	do IY go around it 
90	1:48:44	1:48:44	ok
94	1:53:46	1:53:47	IY hit some rocks though
97	1:54:24	1:54:31	and then what 
110	2:7:9	2:7:16	ok
111	2:8:36	2:8:37	ok

122	2:28:32	2:28:32	ok
125	2:29:7	2:29:15	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
134	2:51:38	2:51:38	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
146	3:4:32	3:4:32	ok
148	3:7:46	3:7:46	IY m three inches above the savannah

5	0:5:15	0:5:17	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
6	0:6:18	0:6:22	the  
7	0:7:37	0:7:39	ok
8	0:8:15	0:8:23	IY re just going down

14	0:15:15	0:15:19	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
17	0:17:2	0:17:5	uhm
18	0:18:37	0:18:37	IY re going about
19	0:19:6	0:19:8	no IY have

24	0:25:46	0:25:55	maybe like
26	0:26:41	0:26:44	and then IY slope up
29	0:29:41	0:29:44	and 
30	0:30:58	0:30:59	are IY anywhere near there 
31	0:31:22	0:31:27	and then IY slope
32	0:31:34	0:31:40	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
33	0:32:10	0:32:19	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
34	0:32:34	0:32:35	maybe like
37	0:32:45	0:32:48	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
39	0:35:46	0:35:50	uhm
41	0:37:15	0:37:20	ok well
42	0:39:43	0:39:51	and IY go to the left a little bit

47	0:46:5	0:46:14	no IY don t have a waterhole
49	0:52:36	0:52:41	uhm
50	0:55:35	0:55:39	an inch maybe a little bit less
51	0:59:31	0:59:37	and then IY re going down
52	1:0:6	1:0:15	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
53	1:0:38	1:0:40	for about two inches
54	1:1:41	1:1:47	yes
55	1:2:4	1:2:8	is the plane crash  
56	1:3:17	1:3:19	ok
57	1:4:10	1:4:12	where IY re going down to a plane crash
59	1:6:15	1:6:19	and then
60	1:7:36	1:7:36	ok
61	1:8:10	1:8:16	and it slopes a little bit to the right
62	1:10:8	1:10:16	ok
63	1:10:56	1:10:58	ok
64	1:11:31	1:11:34	a little bit too
67	1:16:5	1:16:9	no
68	1:17:47	1:17:53	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
70	1:19:2	1:19:4	are IY anywere near there 
72	1:21:0	1:21:9	uhhh no
74	1:22:1	1:22:2	to the left
75	1:23:38	1:23:42	IY plane crash 
76	1:25:44	1:25:52	and then IY slope down to the left
78	1:30:33	1:30:33	just do it like this ok
80	1:31:33	1:31:40	uhm
81	1:33:33	1:33:33	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
82	1:33:46	1:33:46	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
83	1:36:27	1:36:34	and then IY go
86	1:41:53	1:42:1	three inches
87	1:42:54	1:42:57	yes IY re going towards the lake
88	1:46:48	1:46:52	IY would say
91	1:51:24	1:51:33	and then
92	1:52:50	1:52:53	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
93	1:53:14	1:53:17	uhm
95	1:53:46	1:53:52	uhm
96	1:54:29	1:54:29	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
98	1:54:38	1:54:38	and then IY ll come to a savannah
99	1:55:14	1:55:21	have a s 
100	1:55:29	1:55:38	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
101	1:56:7	1:56:13	like three inches 
102	1:56:28	1:56:33	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
103	1:57:16	1:57:20	like
104	1:58:53	1:58:58	like
105	1:59:12	1:59:12	ok
106	1:59:8	1:59:16	so that s about IY would say
107	2:2:18	2:2:18	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
108	2:4:35	2:4:42	to IY right 
109	2:7:3	2:7:6	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
114	2:14:39	2:14:43	ok
115	2:14:54	2:14:59	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
116	2:15:46	2:15:50	and then IY go straight
118	2:20:36	2:20:37	there s a there s  
119	2:22:28	2:22:28	are IY in like   
121	2:25:29	2:25:31	ok
123	2:28:36	2:28:43	a little
124	2:28:50	2:28:55	around the bottom of it
126	2:31:30	2:31:32	like maybe an inch
127	2:34:4	2:34:4	and there s a plane crash
128	2:35:26	2:35:35	IY go straight down
129	2:36:19	2:36:19	IY re kind of going  
130	2:37:41	2:37:46	ok
131	2:39:5	2:39:14	well
132	2:44:15	2:44:23	IY just kind of slope down
133	2:45:51	2:45:58	after that IY go straight again
135	2:53:35	2:53:42	like
136	2:54:2	2:54:11	maybe IY have different things
137	2:54:38	2:54:40	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
138	2:58:50	2:58:54	and then
139	2:59:22	2:59:30	it s right next to it
140	3:0:4	3:0:10	uhm
141	3:0:9	3:0:17	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
142	3:1:35	3:1:41	well alright
143	3:1:42	3:1:47	yes
144	3:1:50	3:1:57	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
145	3:2:14	3:2:23	and IY should have a straight line there
147	3:4:58	3:5:6	uhm
149	3:8:24	3:8:33	and 
150	3:11:1	3:11:4	that s IY little slope
153	3:16:36	3:16:39	and then
154	3:17:44	3:17:49	IY re going like
155	3:17:50	3:17:59	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
156	3:19:25	3:19:26	ok
157	3:22:15	3:22:22	alright well IY ll keep going and see
158	3:24:30	3:24:31	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
160	3:26:50	3:26:57	uhm
161	3:27:22	3:27:30	IY got that 
163	3:29:21	3:29:23	ok IY plane crash isn t there
164	3:29:23	3:29:32	couple inches IY re sloping down
165	3:30:0	3:30:0	ok
166	3:31:2	3:31:9	and that s where the plane crash is
167	3:31:45	3:31:45	and IY just go straight up
168	3:31:49	3:31:56	are IY  
169	3:33:55	3:33:59	couple miles or something
170	3:35:7	3:35:16	IY re sloping
171	3:35:52	3:36:0	uh like
172	3:36:5	3:36:5	IY re at the plane crash
175	3:39:0	3:39:9	like an inch
176	3:39:6	3:39:14	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
177	3:40:29	3:40:30	for like
178	3:41:7	3:41:15	they re there
179	3:42:33	3:42:42	like four or five inches to the left
180	3:43:23	3:43:29	IY don t know
181	3:43:44	3:43:46	the slate mountain is towards the right
182	3:45:26	3:45:27	maybe
184	3:46:5	3:46:6	alright 
185	3:46:33	3:46:35	ok
186	3:49:37	3:49:44	four or five inches to the left
187	3:51:32	3:51:33	kind of across from stony desert
189	3:55:33	3:55:37	ok
191	3:57:14	3:57:22	three inches straight across
192	3:58:12	3:58:18	ok
194	3:59:56	4:0:4	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
195	4:0:4	4:0:12	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
197	4:0:46	4:0:54	ok
198	4:3:54	4:4:1	and IY slope is about an inch long
199	4:4:42	4:4:43	ok
201	4:10:14	4:10:19	and then IY are
202	4:10:41	4:10:43	and then
203	4:10:55	4:10:56	after IY slope down IY d say
204	4:11:5	4:11:10	so IY make that circle
207	4:14:46	4:14:53	and IY re going up like
208	4:15:16	4:15:22	so anyway
210	4:17:9	4:17:9	about like
212	4:18:36	4:18:43	maybe four inches on the paper
213	4:19:38	4:19:41	IY make
214	4:22:42	4:22:50	and IY re sloping to the left
217	4:24:47	4:24:52	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
218	4:27:34	4:27:38	probably the same thing
219	4:29:1	4:29:8	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
220	4:29:32	4:29:36	ok IY re at the savannah
221	4:30:49	4:30:54	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
222	4:31:14	4:31:14	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
223	4:34:40	4:34:47	alright 
224	4:35:6	4:35:12	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
227	4:36:46	4:36:50	uhm
228	4:41:9	4:41:14	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
230	4:43:40	4:43:46	IY re starting at the stony desert
231	4:44:15	4:44:17	what 
232	4:45:44	4:45:47	it s not a big curve
233	4:45:53	4:46:1	five
234	4:47:14	4:47:22	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
236	4:48:8	4:48:14	uhm
237	4:49:44	4:49:48	so
239	4:52:42	4:52:47	are IY in like almost the top of the
240	4:54:58	4:55:1	ok
241	4:55:19	4:55:27	then
242	4:56:1	4:56:2	to the white mountain
243	4:56:39	4:56:48	and IY re going straight up
245	4:59:22	4:59:23	IY slope down again
246	5:1:59	5:2:8	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
247	5:2:8	5:2:12	on IY sheet anyway
248	5:2:45	5:2:47	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
251	5:10:36	5:10:39	so IY go three inches straight
252	5:10:37	5:10:44	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
253	5:12:39	5:12:43	three inches
254	5:13:1	5:13:3	well
256	5:14:33	5:14:39	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
257	5:17:23	5:17:23	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
259	5:20:28	5:20:35	uhm
262	5:30:11	5:30:18	IY re actually starting like right
263	5:30:45	5:30:47	uhm
264	5:31:13	5:31:20	do IY have roman baths 
266	5:34:25	5:34:26	ok and then IY re going
267	5:34:48	5:34:49	from
268	5:34:56	5:35:2	IY wanna kind of curve
269	5:36:43	5:36:44	uhm
270	5:38:3	5:38:5	ok
271	5:38:6	5:38:11	and
274	5:39:47	5:39:53	but
275	5:40:26	5:40:33	to the right
276	5:42:32	5:42:36	and is to the left
278	5:43:54	5:43:56	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
279	5:44:34	5:44:42	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
281	5:47:58	5:48:3	ok
283	5:55:1	5:55:3	to the left
284	5:56:38	5:56:45	no IY don t have any rocks
285	5:57:28	5:57:33	a quarter of an inch
286	5:59:3	5:59:9	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
289	6:3:10	6:3:16	slight
291	6:4:9	6:4:14	to the left
292	6:5:54	6:5:55	uhm and there is a stony desert
293	6:8:33	6:8:41	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
294	6:8:56	6:9:5	not right at the stony desert
295	6:9:56	6:10:4	and then
296	6:10:37	6:10:45	well just
297	6:10:47	6:10:53	uhm
298	6:12:2	6:12:6	IY move to the left
299	6:12:49	6:12:58	and IY re going
300	6:14:55	6:14:55	uhm
301	6:15:5	6:15:14	for like
302	6:17:11	6:17:16	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
304	6:18:30	6:18:38	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
305	6:21:35	6:21:43	after the circle
306	6:22:24	6:22:33	like IY re sloping
307	6:23:27	6:23:32	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
308	6:24:20	6:24:21	and then IY  IY go up
311	6:26:42	6:26:48	so IY re at the hot springs
312	6:27:12	6:27:17	ok well
313	6:28:9	6:28:14	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
314	6:29:8	6:29:13	alright alright well just
316	6:31:25	6:31:31	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
318	6:32:4	6:32:6	alright are IY starting  near the  
319	6:32:26	6:32:31	go up like three  three and a half inches
