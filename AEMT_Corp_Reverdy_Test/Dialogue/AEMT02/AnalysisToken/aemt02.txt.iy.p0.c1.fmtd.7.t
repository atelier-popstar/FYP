start
start g
0	0:0:44	0:0:49	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
1	0:3:24	0:3:30	and 
2	0:3:27	0:3:30	well just
3	0:4:6	0:4:8	and IY re going up like
4	0:5:13	0:5:20	are IY  
5	0:7:0	0:7:6	they re there
7	0:8:56	0:9:4	ok
8	0:9:7	0:9:15	and then IY go straight
9	0:9:41	0:9:43	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
10	0:11:12	0:11:19	maybe like
12	0:13:54	0:14:2	kind of across from stony desert
13	0:14:42	0:14:45	IY don t know
14	0:14:55	0:14:57	uhm
15	0:15:54	0:16:1	three inches
16	0:17:33	0:17:39	and that s where the plane crash is
17	0:18:20	0:18:22	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
20	0:26:38	0:26:42	three inches
21	0:27:28	0:27:33	IY just kind of slope down
23	0:29:22	0:29:23	and then IY  IY go up
25	0:33:31	0:33:40	ok
26	0:39:49	0:39:49	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
27	0:39:59	0:40:1	so that s about IY would say
28	0:40:22	0:40:28	uhm
29	0:40:51	0:40:52	to the lake 
30	0:40:47	0:40:56	have a s 
31	0:41:27	0:41:33	not right at the stony desert
32	0:42:42	0:42:44	are IY in like almost the top of the
33	0:42:44	0:42:47	well
35	0:45:0	0:45:2	no
36	0:45:19	0:45:25	three inches straight across
38	0:48:59	0:49:5	ok
39	0:49:54	0:49:59	to the left
40	0:51:56	0:51:59	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
41	0:52:26	0:52:27	a little bit too
42	0:53:13	0:53:18	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
43	0:54:29	0:54:30	and
46	0:57:36	0:57:40	uhm
49	0:59:47	0:59:54	is the plane crash  
50	1:0:11	1:0:19	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
52	1:3:13	1:3:13	hmm
54	1:3:46	1:3:50	ok
55	1:6:2	1:6:7	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
56	1:7:18	1:7:22	so IY re at the hot springs
57	1:7:27	1:7:29	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
58	1:8:20	1:8:28	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
59	1:10:0	1:10:9	to the left
61	1:14:46	1:14:50	ok
62	1:19:8	1:19:9	and then IY are
63	1:20:5	1:20:10	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
64	1:23:32	1:23:39	and there s a plane crash
65	1:24:8	1:24:12	ok 
66	1:27:23	1:27:28	couple inches IY re sloping down
67	1:27:32	1:27:35	uhm
70	1:33:19	1:33:24	so
73	1:36:29	1:36:37	ok
74	1:40:50	1:40:59	uhm
76	1:41:24	1:41:28	it s right next to it
79	1:46:1	1:46:7	ok
81	1:46:8	1:46:17	after the circle
83	1:49:41	1:49:41	the  
84	1:52:30	1:52:33	and IY slope is about an inch long
85	1:55:55	1:56:3	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
89	2:1:49	2:1:53	ok well
92	2:4:44	2:4:53	and then IY slope down to the left
93	2:5:33	2:5:33	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
94	2:6:13	2:6:20	and 
95	2:6:44	2:6:44	IY wanna kind of curve
96	2:6:49	2:6:56	and then
97	2:7:59	2:8:0	and then
98	2:14:51	2:14:53	around the bottom of it
99	2:16:45	2:16:45	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
100	2:16:41	2:16:47	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
101	2:18:1	2:18:2	ok
102	2:25:5	2:25:5	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
103	2:25:8	2:25:12	then
104	2:28:26	2:28:30	ok
105	2:31:13	2:31:21	for like
106	2:31:33	2:31:35	so IY make that circle
107	2:31:41	2:31:45	IY re sloping
108	2:35:9	2:35:16	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
110	2:39:47	2:39:50	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
111	2:40:7	2:40:13	ok
112	2:43:32	2:43:32	ok
113	2:45:30	2:45:38	uhm
114	2:47:48	2:47:53	from
115	2:47:53	2:47:57	uhm
116	2:48:0	2:48:3	IY got that 
118	2:49:26	2:49:27	IY would say
119	2:53:10	2:53:16	uhm
120	2:55:2	2:55:6	the slate mountain is towards the right
121	2:57:25	2:57:25	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
122	2:57:56	2:58:2	IY re going like
125	3:3:27	3:3:35	IY go straight down
127	3:5:52	3:6:0	alright 
128	3:6:38	3:6:39	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
131	3:7:35	3:7:36	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
132	3:7:58	3:8:4	IY re starting
134	3:8:25	3:8:28	and then IY re going down
135	3:8:56	3:9:3	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
136	3:9:31	3:9:34	uhm
137	3:11:15	3:11:23	for like
139	3:12:21	3:12:25	slight
140	3:13:54	3:13:55	and IY go to the left a little bit
141	3:14:37	3:14:39	and then
143	3:16:11	3:16:14	are IY in like   
144	3:19:13	3:19:17	just do it like this ok
145	3:20:6	3:20:8	IY re actually starting like right
147	3:25:32	3:25:36	five
148	3:25:43	3:25:50	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
149	3:31:5	3:31:11	and then IY slope up
150	3:31:33	3:31:34	after plane crash
152	3:33:55	3:34:0	like
153	3:34:16	3:34:21	ok IY plane crash isn t there
154	3:39:5	3:39:14	IY re going about
155	3:39:22	3:39:25	and is to the left
156	3:39:26	3:39:27	ok
157	3:39:36	3:39:37	alright are IY starting  near the  
158	3:39:51	3:39:51	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
159	3:41:16	3:41:20	uhm
160	3:42:11	3:42:12	that s about five or six inches
161	3:44:29	3:44:31	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
162	3:44:30	3:44:32	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
163	3:45:51	3:45:55	alright alright well just
164	3:46:1	3:46:7	maybe four inches on the paper
165	3:48:59	3:49:4	and IY go down IY slope to the right
166	3:50:38	3:50:42	IY make
167	3:50:46	3:50:48	it s not a big curve
168	3:51:25	3:51:31	IY re starting at the stony desert
169	3:51:38	3:51:46	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
170	3:52:8	3:52:14	ok
171	3:52:37	3:52:38	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
173	3:54:37	3:54:44	and then
175	3:55:17	3:55:17	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
176	3:56:12	3:56:13	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
178	3:57:39	3:57:41	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
179	3:58:37	3:58:39	to the white mountain
180	3:58:50	3:58:53	uhm
183	4:0:36	4:0:41	four or five inches to the left
184	4:2:12	4:2:12	and then IY ll come to a savannah
185	4:3:29	4:3:34	and then
186	4:3:34	4:3:37	alright 
187	4:3:58	4:4:3	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
188	4:5:42	4:5:48	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
190	4:9:53	4:10:1	ok and then IY re going
191	4:10:19	4:10:27	ok
192	4:11:2	4:11:11	no
193	4:13:52	4:14:0	and IY re sloping to the left
194	4:14:50	4:14:52	and it slopes a little bit to the right
195	4:15:6	4:15:10	like four or five inches to the left
196	4:15:58	4:16:4	for about two inches
197	4:17:21	4:17:21	no IY have  
199	4:22:31	4:22:34	IY move to the left
200	4:24:9	4:24:16	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
201	4:24:18	4:24:19	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
202	4:24:38	4:24:47	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
203	4:27:47	4:27:50	go up like three  three and a half inches
205	4:30:40	4:30:44	so IY go three inches straight
206	4:30:57	4:30:59	uhm
208	4:35:36	4:35:42	and
209	4:39:33	4:39:37	you

215	4:44:32	4:44:33	ok
217	4:44:56	4:45:2	maybe
219	4:48:47	4:48:51	no IY don t have any rocks
222	4:50:56	4:51:0	no IY don t have a waterhole
223	4:52:27	4:52:36	about like
225	4:55:33	4:55:38	uhm
227	4:58:4	4:58:9	ok

237	5:4:42	5:4:46	ok
238	5:4:52	5:5:0	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
239	5:4:59	5:5:1	like three inches 
240	5:6:46	5:6:54	couple miles or something
241	5:6:50	5:6:59	like maybe an inch
244	5:9:33	5:9:37	straight up
245	5:11:3	5:11:6	ok IY re at the savannah
246	5:12:14	5:12:23	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
247	5:12:26	5:12:27	ok
249	5:15:56	5:15:58	like
250	5:16:17	5:16:17	where IY re going down to a plane crash
252	5:17:43	5:17:48	uhm
253	5:18:18	5:18:27	ok
254	5:18:24	5:18:28	probably the same thing
256	5:21:49	5:21:49	uhm
257	5:22:31	5:22:33	IY plane crash 
259	5:24:19	5:24:24	and IY re going
260	5:24:38	5:24:46	and then
261	5:25:23	5:25:28	yes

263	5:25:41	5:25:48	IY re kind of going  
264	5:25:42	5:25:51	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
265	5:26:12	5:26:20	no there s no elephants
266	5:27:45	5:27:53	a quarter of an inch
267	5:28:2	5:28:2	on IY sheet anyway
268	5:28:3	5:28:9	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
269	5:31:37	5:31:39	yes
271	5:33:43	5:33:44	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
272	5:35:18	5:35:27	and IY just go straight up
273	5:35:24	5:35:33	like
279	5:41:16	5:41:17	so anyway
281	5:41:42	5:41:43	a little

289	5:51:54	5:51:56	what 
290	5:53:8	5:53:15	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
292	5:55:34	5:55:40	and then IY go
293	5:57:45	5:57:54	are IY anywhere near there 
294	5:59:21	5:59:28	uhm

296	6:0:22	6:0:25	like an inch
298	6:1:55	6:2:2	uh like
300	6:2:58	6:3:6	ok
302	6:3:32	6:3:32	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
303	6:4:16	6:4:23	and then IY slope
304	6:5:41	6:5:49	alright well IY ll keep going and see
305	6:8:0	6:8:4	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
307	6:9:49	6:9:50	yes IY re going towards the lake
308	6:10:52	6:10:59	maybe like
309	6:13:32	6:13:37	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
310	6:14:33	6:14:42	IY slope down again
311	6:16:8	6:16:14	just a slight slope
312	6:20:46	6:20:46	like IY re sloping
314	6:21:57	6:21:57	IY re at the plane crash
315	6:22:26	6:22:29	that s IY little slope
316	6:23:30	6:23:37	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
317	6:23:56	6:24:1	and IY should have a straight line there
319	6:27:26	6:27:28	after that IY go straight again
320	6:28:31	6:28:33	after IY slope down IY d say
322	6:30:10	6:30:17	ok well
323	6:31:17	6:31:17	well alright
324	6:33:37	6:33:39	maybe IY have different things

189	4:8:7	4:8:16	nope IY have a white mountain
198	4:21:39	4:21:43	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
204	4:29:20	4:29:27	to the left of the antelope
207	4:32:13	4:32:17	IY hit some round rocks
211	4:43:25	4:43:31	IY have to back up a little bit
213	4:44:14	4:44:20	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
216	4:44:37	4:44:43	ok
218	4:48:0	4:48:7	yeah 
220	4:49:14	4:49:23	IY go to a lake 
221	4:50:27	4:50:32	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
224	4:52:55	4:53:1	ok
226	4:57:37	4:57:42	up tp the right
228	4:58:42	4:58:43	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
229	4:58:35	4:58:44	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
231	4:59:34	4:59:38	yeah and IY went straight up
232	5:0:21	5:0:21	ok wait hold on
233	5:1:51	5:1:58	IY m three inches above the savannah
234	5:2:42	5:2:42	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
235	5:2:54	5:3:1	and
236	5:3:46	5:3:53	ok
242	5:8:20	5:8:26	yeah 
243	5:9:9	5:9:16	ok

251	5:17:41	5:17:45	ok
255	5:18:55	5:19:1	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
258	5:22:42	5:22:50	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
270	5:33:20	5:33:23	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
274	5:36:19	5:36:26	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
275	5:37:2	5:37:4	ok
276	5:37:0	5:37:9	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
277	5:37:11	5:37:12	ok
278	5:40:4	5:40:7	ok
280	5:41:22	5:41:30	do IY go around it 
285	5:48:17	5:48:19	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
286	5:48:30	5:48:32	 IY m at the savannah
288	5:50:16	5:50:18	ok
291	5:54:6	5:54:15	ok
297	6:1:44	6:1:50	ok
299	6:2:43	6:2:49	mm  mm
301	6:3:6	6:3:13	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
306	6:9:31	6:9:34	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
313	6:20:53	6:20:53	yeah
318	6:25:11	6:25:11	nope
321	6:29:44	6:29:52	so IY go to the left of the antelope
326	6:35:37	6:35:37	yeah
332	6:39:4	6:39:9	around the lake to the top 
341	6:50:58	6:50:58	and curve down to the left 
342	6:52:5	6:52:11	yeah
start g
0	0:0:44	0:0:49	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
1	0:3:24	0:3:30	and 
2	0:3:27	0:3:30	well just
3	0:4:6	0:4:8	and IY re going up like
4	0:5:13	0:5:20	are IY  
5	0:7:0	0:7:6	they re there
7	0:8:56	0:9:4	ok
8	0:9:7	0:9:15	and then IY go straight
9	0:9:41	0:9:43	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
10	0:11:12	0:11:19	maybe like
12	0:13:54	0:14:2	kind of across from stony desert
13	0:14:42	0:14:45	IY don t know
14	0:14:55	0:14:57	uhm
15	0:15:54	0:16:1	three inches
16	0:17:33	0:17:39	and that s where the plane crash is
17	0:18:20	0:18:22	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
20	0:26:38	0:26:42	three inches
21	0:27:28	0:27:33	IY just kind of slope down
23	0:29:22	0:29:23	and then IY  IY go up
25	0:33:31	0:33:40	ok
26	0:39:49	0:39:49	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
27	0:39:59	0:40:1	so that s about IY would say
28	0:40:22	0:40:28	uhm
29	0:40:51	0:40:52	to the lake 
30	0:40:47	0:40:56	have a s 
31	0:41:27	0:41:33	not right at the stony desert
32	0:42:42	0:42:44	are IY in like almost the top of the
33	0:42:44	0:42:47	well
35	0:45:0	0:45:2	no
36	0:45:19	0:45:25	three inches straight across
38	0:48:59	0:49:5	ok
39	0:49:54	0:49:59	to the left
40	0:51:56	0:51:59	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
41	0:52:26	0:52:27	a little bit too
42	0:53:13	0:53:18	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
43	0:54:29	0:54:30	and
46	0:57:36	0:57:40	uhm
49	0:59:47	0:59:54	is the plane crash  
50	1:0:11	1:0:19	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
52	1:3:13	1:3:13	hmm
54	1:3:46	1:3:50	ok
55	1:6:2	1:6:7	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
56	1:7:18	1:7:22	so IY re at the hot springs
57	1:7:27	1:7:29	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
58	1:8:20	1:8:28	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
59	1:10:0	1:10:9	to the left
61	1:14:46	1:14:50	ok
62	1:19:8	1:19:9	and then IY are
63	1:20:5	1:20:10	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
64	1:23:32	1:23:39	and there s a plane crash
65	1:24:8	1:24:12	ok 
66	1:27:23	1:27:28	couple inches IY re sloping down
67	1:27:32	1:27:35	uhm
70	1:33:19	1:33:24	so
73	1:36:29	1:36:37	ok
74	1:40:50	1:40:59	uhm
76	1:41:24	1:41:28	it s right next to it
79	1:46:1	1:46:7	ok
81	1:46:8	1:46:17	after the circle
83	1:49:41	1:49:41	the  
84	1:52:30	1:52:33	and IY slope is about an inch long
85	1:55:55	1:56:3	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
89	2:1:49	2:1:53	ok well
92	2:4:44	2:4:53	and then IY slope down to the left
93	2:5:33	2:5:33	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
94	2:6:13	2:6:20	and 
95	2:6:44	2:6:44	IY wanna kind of curve
96	2:6:49	2:6:56	and then
97	2:7:59	2:8:0	and then
98	2:14:51	2:14:53	around the bottom of it
99	2:16:45	2:16:45	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
100	2:16:41	2:16:47	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
101	2:18:1	2:18:2	ok
102	2:25:5	2:25:5	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
103	2:25:8	2:25:12	then
104	2:28:26	2:28:30	ok
105	2:31:13	2:31:21	for like
106	2:31:33	2:31:35	so IY make that circle
107	2:31:41	2:31:45	IY re sloping
108	2:35:9	2:35:16	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
110	2:39:47	2:39:50	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
111	2:40:7	2:40:13	ok
112	2:43:32	2:43:32	ok
113	2:45:30	2:45:38	uhm

116	2:48:0	2:48:3	IY got that 
118	2:49:26	2:49:27	IY would say
119	2:53:10	2:53:16	uhm
120	2:55:2	2:55:6	the slate mountain is towards the right
121	2:57:25	2:57:25	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
122	2:57:56	2:58:2	IY re going like
125	3:3:27	3:3:35	IY go straight down
127	3:5:52	3:6:0	alright 
128	3:6:38	3:6:39	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
131	3:7:35	3:7:36	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
132	3:7:58	3:8:4	IY re starting
134	3:8:25	3:8:28	and then IY re going down
135	3:8:56	3:9:3	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
136	3:9:31	3:9:34	uhm
137	3:11:15	3:11:23	for like
139	3:12:21	3:12:25	slight
140	3:13:54	3:13:55	and IY go to the left a little bit
141	3:14:37	3:14:39	and then
143	3:16:11	3:16:14	are IY in like   
144	3:19:13	3:19:17	just do it like this ok
145	3:20:6	3:20:8	IY re actually starting like right
147	3:25:32	3:25:36	five
148	3:25:43	3:25:50	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
149	3:31:5	3:31:11	and then IY slope up
150	3:31:33	3:31:34	after plane crash
152	3:33:55	3:34:0	like
153	3:34:16	3:34:21	ok IY plane crash isn t there
154	3:39:5	3:39:14	IY re going about
155	3:39:22	3:39:25	and is to the left
156	3:39:26	3:39:27	ok
157	3:39:36	3:39:37	alright are IY starting  near the  
158	3:39:51	3:39:51	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
159	3:41:16	3:41:20	uhm
160	3:42:11	3:42:12	that s about five or six inches
161	3:44:29	3:44:31	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
162	3:44:30	3:44:32	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
163	3:45:51	3:45:55	alright alright well just
164	3:46:1	3:46:7	maybe four inches on the paper
165	3:48:59	3:49:4	and IY go down IY slope to the right
166	3:50:38	3:50:42	IY make
167	3:50:46	3:50:48	it s not a big curve
168	3:51:25	3:51:31	IY re starting at the stony desert
169	3:51:38	3:51:46	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
170	3:52:8	3:52:14	ok
171	3:52:37	3:52:38	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
173	3:54:37	3:54:44	and then
175	3:55:17	3:55:17	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
176	3:56:12	3:56:13	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
178	3:57:39	3:57:41	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
179	3:58:37	3:58:39	to the white mountain
180	3:58:50	3:58:53	uhm
183	4:0:36	4:0:41	four or five inches to the left
184	4:2:12	4:2:12	and then IY ll come to a savannah

186	4:3:34	4:3:37	alright 
187	4:3:58	4:4:3	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
188	4:5:42	4:5:48	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
190	4:9:53	4:10:1	ok and then IY re going
191	4:10:19	4:10:27	ok
192	4:11:2	4:11:11	no
193	4:13:52	4:14:0	and IY re sloping to the left
194	4:14:50	4:14:52	and it slopes a little bit to the right
195	4:15:6	4:15:10	like four or five inches to the left
196	4:15:58	4:16:4	for about two inches
197	4:17:21	4:17:21	no IY have  
199	4:22:31	4:22:34	IY move to the left
200	4:24:9	4:24:16	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
201	4:24:18	4:24:19	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
202	4:24:38	4:24:47	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
203	4:27:47	4:27:50	go up like three  three and a half inches
205	4:30:40	4:30:44	so IY go three inches straight

238	5:4:52	5:5:0	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
239	5:4:59	5:5:1	like three inches 
240	5:6:46	5:6:54	couple miles or something
241	5:6:50	5:6:59	like maybe an inch
244	5:9:33	5:9:37	straight up
245	5:11:3	5:11:6	ok IY re at the savannah
246	5:12:14	5:12:23	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
247	5:12:26	5:12:27	ok
249	5:15:56	5:15:58	like
250	5:16:17	5:16:17	where IY re going down to a plane crash
252	5:17:43	5:17:48	uhm
253	5:18:18	5:18:27	ok
254	5:18:24	5:18:28	probably the same thing
256	5:21:49	5:21:49	uhm
257	5:22:31	5:22:33	IY plane crash 
259	5:24:19	5:24:24	and IY re going
260	5:24:38	5:24:46	and then
261	5:25:23	5:25:28	yes

263	5:25:41	5:25:48	IY re kind of going  
264	5:25:42	5:25:51	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
265	5:26:12	5:26:20	no there s no elephants
266	5:27:45	5:27:53	a quarter of an inch
267	5:28:2	5:28:2	on IY sheet anyway
268	5:28:3	5:28:9	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
269	5:31:37	5:31:39	yes
271	5:33:43	5:33:44	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
272	5:35:18	5:35:27	and IY just go straight up
273	5:35:24	5:35:33	like
279	5:41:16	5:41:17	so anyway
281	5:41:42	5:41:43	a little

284	5:46:23	5:46:25	ok
287	5:50:11	5:50:16	and IY re going straight up
289	5:51:54	5:51:56	what 
290	5:53:8	5:53:15	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
292	5:55:34	5:55:40	and then IY go
293	5:57:45	5:57:54	are IY anywhere near there 
294	5:59:21	5:59:28	uhm
295	6:0:10	6:0:12	do IY have roman baths 
296	6:0:22	6:0:25	like an inch
298	6:1:55	6:2:2	uh like
300	6:2:58	6:3:6	ok
302	6:3:32	6:3:32	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
303	6:4:16	6:4:23	and then IY slope
304	6:5:41	6:5:49	alright well IY ll keep going and see
305	6:8:0	6:8:4	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
307	6:9:49	6:9:50	yes IY re going towards the lake
308	6:10:52	6:10:59	maybe like
309	6:13:32	6:13:37	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
310	6:14:33	6:14:42	IY slope down again
311	6:16:8	6:16:14	just a slight slope
312	6:20:46	6:20:46	like IY re sloping
314	6:21:57	6:21:57	IY re at the plane crash
315	6:22:26	6:22:29	that s IY little slope
316	6:23:30	6:23:37	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
317	6:23:56	6:24:1	and IY should have a straight line there
319	6:27:26	6:27:28	after that IY go straight again
320	6:28:31	6:28:33	after IY slope down IY d say
322	6:30:10	6:30:17	ok well
323	6:31:17	6:31:17	well alright
324	6:33:37	6:33:39	maybe IY have different things
