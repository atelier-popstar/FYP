start
0:2:13	0:2:14	f	ok
0:2:25	0:2:28	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
0:3:53	0:3:54	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
0:4:31	0:4:40	g	alright 
0:6:48	0:6:52	g	IY go straight down
0:6:57	0:7:4	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
0:7:29	0:7:37	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
0:8:30	0:8:31	g	ok
0:10:14	0:10:18	g	alright 
0:11:10	0:11:14	g	and IY re going straight up
0:11:8	0:11:15	f	ok
0:11:40	0:11:43	g	ok
0:18:16	0:18:17	g	uh like
0:19:18	0:19:23	g	yes
0:23:23	0:23:30	f	oh
0:26:22	0:26:29	g	alright alright well just
0:32:13	0:32:18	f	IY ve a plane crash though
0:33:16	0:33:21	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
0:33:52	0:33:55	f	ok
0:34:0	0:34:2	g	and then IY slope up
0:35:5	0:35:8	g	uhm
0:35:51	0:35:59	g	and then
0:38:26	0:38:28	g	IY re kind of going  
0:38:36	0:38:36	g	so that s about IY would say
0:39:30	0:39:31	g	like IY re sloping
0:40:30	0:40:31	f	yeah
0:40:37	0:40:37	g	so anyway
0:40:49	0:40:50	g	IY don t know
0:41:21	0:41:29	g	three inches
0:41:55	0:41:56	g	a little bit too
0:44:30	0:44:31	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
0:46:15	0:46:20	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
0:47:23	0:47:24	f	IY hit some round rocks
0:49:0	0:49:5	g	uhm
0:50:15	0:50:21	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
0:51:49	0:51:53	f	ok
0:55:20	0:55:22	f	ok
0:55:56	0:56:4	f	ok
0:56:54	0:57:1	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
0:57:44	0:57:53	f	yeah
1:0:4	1:0:6	g	that s IY little slope
1:0:9	1:0:16	f	do IY go around it 
1:2:12	1:2:12	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
1:3:10	1:3:16	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
1:3:21	1:3:26	g	ok 
1:4:18	1:4:22	f	yeah
1:4:22	1:4:27	g	and 
1:5:3	1:5:8	g	well just
1:5:46	1:5:54	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
1:6:14	1:6:17	g	probably the same thing
1:6:51	1:6:59	g	straight up
1:8:43	1:8:48	f	ok
1:9:23	1:9:30	f	and then what 
1:13:1	1:13:2	g	IY re just going down
1:16:4	1:16:9	g	just a slight slope
1:16:22	1:16:24	g	and is to the left
1:19:2	1:19:5	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
1:19:14	1:19:18	f	ok
1:19:27	1:19:34	g	and then IY go straight
1:19:33	1:19:37	f	mm hmm
1:21:58	1:22:6	g	ok
1:22:11	1:22:11	g	ok
1:22:33	1:22:34	g	hmm
1:22:44	1:22:48	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
1:23:53	1:23:53	g	IY re starting
1:24:9	1:24:17	g	and then
1:24:51	1:24:58	g	uhm
1:25:2	1:25:3	g	are IY  
1:29:15	1:29:20	g	ok
1:29:23	1:29:26	f	mm hmm
1:30:52	1:31:1	g	and then IY are
1:31:25	1:31:29	f	ok
1:32:20	1:32:25	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
1:33:26	1:33:32	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
1:33:55	1:34:2	g	it s not a big curve
1:34:10	1:34:19	g	about like
1:35:23	1:35:29	g	yes
1:36:32	1:36:36	g	is the plane crash  
1:37:42	1:37:43	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
1:37:41	1:37:49	g	IY re actually starting like right
1:38:19	1:38:21	g	ok
1:41:34	1:41:38	g	a little
1:42:13	1:42:16	g	the  
1:43:26	1:43:26	g	to IY right 
1:43:50	1:43:58	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
1:45:57	1:45:58	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
1:46:38	1:46:42	g	maybe IY have different things
1:49:1	1:49:3	g	that s about five or six inches
1:50:15	1:50:15	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
1:51:0	1:51:6	g	no IY have  
1:51:24	1:51:32	g	ok
1:51:53	1:51:55	f	yep
1:54:26	1:54:33	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
1:56:6	1:56:14	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
1:58:21	1:58:24	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
1:59:10	1:59:14	g	well
1:59:9	1:59:16	f	ok
2:1:2	2:1:2	g	for about two inches
2:2:27	2:2:27	g	ok
2:3:0	2:3:5	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
2:3:18	2:3:22	g	ok
2:4:9	2:4:17	g	ok
2:6:44	2:6:45	g	IY re going about
2:7:5	2:7:6	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
2:7:14	2:7:23	g	a quarter of an inch
2:8:26	2:8:27	g	and then IY go
2:9:48	2:9:55	f	uhm IY
2:10:36	2:10:37	f	ok
2:10:42	2:10:46	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
2:10:48	2:10:52	g	ok
2:11:10	2:11:19	g	and then IY re going down
2:12:35	2:12:42	g	slight
2:13:16	2:13:22	f	yeah IY see that
2:13:46	2:13:49	g	and IY just go straight up
2:15:1	2:15:1	g	are IY in like   
2:14:59	2:15:7	f	ok
2:15:41	2:15:44	f	ok
2:15:44	2:15:53	g	and then
2:17:36	2:17:38	f	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
2:18:2	2:18:10	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
2:19:40	2:19:47	g	to the right
2:20:7	2:20:7	g	from
2:20:9	2:20:10	f	ok
2:20:20	2:20:26	g	then
2:21:48	2:21:53	g	so
2:21:58	2:22:6	g	uhm

2:22:42	2:22:43	f	ok
2:23:27	2:23:30	f	mm hmm
2:26:15	2:26:24	g	to the left
2:27:0	2:27:1	g	and IY should have a straight line there
2:27:40	2:27:47	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
2:27:45	2:27:49	f	ok
2:28:1	2:28:9	g	uhm
2:29:37	2:29:43	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
2:33:1	2:33:2	f	ok
2:38:28	2:38:30	f	yeah 
2:38:54	2:38:55	g	for like
2:39:23	2:39:26	g	IY wanna kind of curve
2:42:48	2:42:50	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
2:46:10	2:46:15	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
2:46:27	2:46:29	g	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
2:49:42	2:49:42	g	no IY don t have a waterhole
2:55:47	2:55:50	g	like
2:56:21	2:56:25	g	IY got that 
2:56:36	2:56:41	g	just do it like this ok
2:57:22	2:57:22	f	mm  mm
2:58:17	2:58:17	g	four or five inches to the left
3:3:6	3:3:7	g	uhm
3:4:20	3:4:26	g	and then IY slope
3:5:46	3:5:55	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
3:5:58	3:5:59	g	like maybe an inch
3:6:55	3:7:1	g	uhm
3:10:32	3:10:35	g	so IY go three inches straight
3:12:39	3:12:47	g	IY re at the plane crash
3:12:59	3:13:6	g	no
3:13:21	3:13:27	g	maybe
3:16:21	3:16:27	f	to the left
3:17:44	3:17:48	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
3:17:44	3:17:52	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
3:17:56	3:17:59	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
3:18:5	3:18:12	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
3:18:16	3:18:17	g	ok
3:19:3	3:19:4	f	how many inches do IY think 
3:23:0	3:23:8	f	and curve down to the left 
3:23:38	3:23:45	g	maybe like
3:25:36	3:25:41	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
3:27:9	3:27:16	g	and then IY  IY go up
3:30:40	3:30:41	f	mm hmm
3:30:42	3:30:51	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
3:31:5	3:31:9	g	like three inches 
3:32:6	3:32:6	g	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
3:32:24	3:32:25	f	yeah
3:32:47	3:32:48	f	nope
3:32:46	3:32:52	g	like an inch
3:33:44	3:33:51	f	around the top of the lake 
3:38:33	3:38:36	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
3:39:53	3:39:59	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
3:41:43	3:41:46	g	ok and then IY re going
3:42:8	3:42:13	f	do IY go through anything 
3:44:25	3:44:33	g	ok
3:47:32	3:47:37	g	uhm
3:52:10	3:52:14	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
3:54:27	3:54:27	g	ok
3:54:32	3:54:34	g	they re there
3:54:43	3:54:43	g	ok
3:54:53	3:54:54	g	to the left
3:55:18	3:55:20	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
3:55:24	3:55:33	g	IY just kind of slope down
3:56:26	3:56:34	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
3:56:40	3:56:41	g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
3:57:24	3:57:31	g	like
3:59:6	3:59:9	g	do IY have roman baths 
3:59:9	3:59:15	g	are IY anywhere near there 
3:59:43	3:59:43	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
4:0:33	4:0:38	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
4:0:55	4:1:4	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
4:1:41	4:1:42	g	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
4:2:1	4:2:2	f	up tp the right
4:3:47	4:3:50	g	after the circle
4:4:27	4:4:35	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
4:5:26	4:5:33	g	to the left
4:5:54	4:5:56	f	ok wait hold on
4:6:30	4:6:34	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
4:7:55	4:8:2	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
4:8:23	4:8:24	f	IY m three inches above the savannah
4:12:3	4:12:12	f	yeah
4:13:36	4:13:39	g	kind of across from stony desert
4:14:33	4:14:42	g	so IY re at the hot springs
4:16:24	4:16:32	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
4:17:19	4:17:19	g	uhhh no
4:17:26	4:17:33	g	IY make
4:18:6	4:18:7	f	ok
4:19:6	4:19:8	g	IY plane crash 
4:20:10	4:20:10	g	uhm
4:20:44	4:20:44	f	to the right 
4:21:26	4:21:27	g	around the bottom of it
4:22:59	4:23:7	g	and
4:23:37	4:23:39	g	ok
4:26:29	4:26:33	g	what 
4:26:53	4:26:56	f	to the left of the antelope
4:31:39	4:31:40	f	ok
4:36:1	4:36:1	g	and
4:36:27	4:36:34	g	three inches straight across
4:38:3	4:38:3	g	ok
4:38:12	4:38:14	g	uhm
4:40:28	4:40:31	g	it s right next to it
4:41:55	4:42:4	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
4:42:42	4:42:50	g	and there s a plane crash
4:43:51	4:43:54	g	there s a there s  
4:43:55	4:43:55	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
4:44:36	4:44:38	g	like four or five inches to the left
4:45:2	4:45:7	f	IY hit some rocks though
4:45:14	4:45:16	f	IY have to back up a little bit
4:46:40	4:46:49	f	ok
4:47:13	4:47:20	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
4:48:28	4:48:30	g	no there s no elephants
4:50:10	4:50:13	g	and then
4:52:56	4:52:56	g	and IY re going up like
4:56:47	4:56:53	g	to the lake 
4:57:5	4:57:10	g	uhm
4:57:24	4:57:24	f	uh IY don t know know what to say
4:57:46	4:57:52	f	and

4:59:53	4:59:57	f	ok
5:0:5	5:0:14	g	but
5:1:9	5:1:12	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
5:2:2	5:2:5	f	around the lake to the top 
5:2:16	5:2:20	f	elephants 
5:3:57	5:4:1	g	ok IY re at the savannah
5:8:13	5:8:13	g	and IY go to the left a little bit
5:10:51	5:10:52	f	and to the right 
5:14:35	5:14:44	g	have a s 
5:15:19	5:15:20	g	well
5:15:22	5:15:23	g	to the white mountain
5:15:42	5:15:45	g	what 
5:16:52	5:16:58	g	IY would say
5:17:2	5:17:3	g	yes IY re going towards the lake
5:17:22	5:17:31	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
5:17:34	5:17:34	g	like
5:18:5	5:18:14	g	an inch maybe a little bit less
5:19:50	5:19:53	g	five
5:19:55	5:19:57	g	after IY slope down IY d say
5:22:39	5:22:42	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
5:23:47	5:23:51	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
5:24:29	5:24:29	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
5:27:21	5:27:22	f	nope IY have a white mountain
5:27:15	5:27:24	g	maybe like
5:29:27	5:29:32	g	and then
5:29:56	5:29:57	g	couple miles or something
5:30:23	5:30:24	f	IY go to a lake 
5:33:53	5:33:54	g	ok well
5:37:15	5:37:21	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
5:37:21	5:37:24	f	yeah 
5:38:26	5:38:28	g	for like
5:38:29	5:38:30	g	uhm
5:38:30	5:38:39	g	three inches
5:39:21	5:39:21	g	ok
5:40:9	5:40:17	g	and IY re going
5:41:3	5:41:6	g	and then IY slope down to the left
5:43:51	5:43:54	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
5:45:3	5:45:9	f	IY know IY have different things so
5:46:47	5:46:48	g	maybe four inches on the paper
5:47:6	5:47:14	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
5:48:48	5:48:57	f	so wait
5:49:28	5:49:28	g	IY re starting at the stony desert
5:51:40	5:51:45	g	IY move to the left
5:52:43	5:52:45	f	ok
5:55:28	5:55:28	g	no
5:55:42	5:55:47	g	like
5:56:10	5:56:14	g	on IY sheet anyway
5:56:25	5:56:25	f	ok
5:57:10	5:57:14	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right
5:57:13	5:57:19	g	ok
5:57:42	5:57:42	g	IY re going like
5:59:27	5:59:27	f	ok
5:59:26	5:59:32	g	after plane crash
5:59:48	5:59:55	g	uhm
5:59:56	6:0:1	f	to 
6:0:10	6:0:14	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
6:0:17	6:0:25	f	mm hmm
6:4:28	6:4:29	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
6:6:18	6:6:24	g	uhm
6:6:41	6:6:49	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
6:7:57	6:8:1	g	are IY anywere near there 
6:10:7	6:10:7	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
6:10:5	6:10:8	g	after that IY go straight again
6:15:28	6:15:28	f	ok
