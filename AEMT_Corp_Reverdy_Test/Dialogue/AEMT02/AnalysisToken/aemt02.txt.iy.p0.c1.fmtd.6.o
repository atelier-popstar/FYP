start
0:1:27	0:1:28	f	mm hmm
0:1:29	0:1:36	f	mm hmm
0:6:40	0:6:48	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
0:6:50	0:6:53	g	a quarter of an inch
0:8:19	0:8:24	g	no IY don t have a waterhole
0:12:39	0:12:39	g	are IY in like   
0:12:51	0:12:55	g	like IY re sloping
0:14:26	0:14:26	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
0:15:2	0:15:5	g	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
0:16:5	0:16:12	g	and then
0:17:5	0:17:5	f	ok
0:18:13	0:18:20	g	uhm
0:19:9	0:19:15	g	not right at the stony desert
0:21:22	0:21:23	f	nope
0:21:21	0:21:28	g	like an inch
0:23:58	0:24:2	f	ok
0:25:9	0:25:12	f	to the left
0:28:43	0:28:44	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
0:28:49	0:28:55	g	a little bit too
0:29:29	0:29:29	f	mm hmm
0:30:10	0:30:10	g	so anyway
0:31:9	0:31:12	g	ok
0:31:7	0:31:16	g	IY go straight down
0:31:59	0:32:3	g	five
0:32:59	0:33:3	f	IY go to a lake 
0:36:3	0:36:9	g	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
0:36:47	0:36:53	f	ok
0:37:45	0:37:50	f	yeah
0:38:39	0:38:43	g	so
0:39:33	0:39:34	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
0:39:57	0:40:4	g	and IY go to the left a little bit
0:40:32	0:40:36	f	ok
0:43:26	0:43:27	f	ok
0:44:10	0:44:13	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
0:45:42	0:45:48	g	and then IY slope down to the left
0:48:6	0:48:9	g	well alright
0:50:38	0:50:44	g	and then
0:51:23	0:51:28	f	ok
0:53:39	0:53:41	g	no IY have  
0:54:44	0:54:45	g	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
0:57:11	0:57:16	g	yes
0:58:39	0:58:46	g	around the bottom of it
1:0:3	1:0:5	g	and there s a plane crash
1:0:17	1:0:20	g	ok
1:0:36	1:0:42	f	ok
1:1:58	1:2:5	g	no IY don t have any rocks
1:4:16	1:4:19	g	yes
1:4:42	1:4:43	g	ok and then IY re going
1:6:52	1:7:0	g	maybe
1:8:49	1:8:52	f	IY m three inches above the savannah
1:9:13	1:9:18	g	uhm
1:11:3	1:11:8	g	after that IY go straight again
1:11:21	1:11:26	g	and IY re going straight up
1:13:0	1:13:6	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
1:12:57	1:13:6	f	do IY go around it 
1:13:37	1:13:41	f	ok
1:13:44	1:13:47	g	IY make
1:14:10	1:14:18	f	mm hmm
1:14:49	1:14:55	g	uhm
1:15:49	1:15:50	g	and then IY are
1:16:26	1:16:31	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
1:18:6	1:18:8	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
1:19:14	1:19:18	g	and then
1:19:24	1:19:31	g	that s IY little slope
1:20:16	1:20:16	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
1:20:48	1:20:49	g	it s right next to it
1:21:10	1:21:18	g	IY re just going down
1:24:5	1:24:14	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
1:25:5	1:25:14	g	to IY right 
1:26:54	1:27:0	f	to 
1:27:1	1:27:9	g	ok
1:27:58	1:28:1	f	mm  mm
1:28:19	1:28:19	f	ok
1:30:48	1:30:50	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
1:31:38	1:31:43	g	IY re actually starting like right
1:33:8	1:33:13	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
1:34:34	1:34:42	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
1:35:53	1:36:0	g	ok
1:41:9	1:41:15	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
1:44:51	1:44:55	g	uhm
1:44:57	1:45:4	g	is the plane crash  
1:48:6	1:48:14	g	uhm
1:49:8	1:49:9	f	ok
1:49:8	1:49:15	g	and that s where the plane crash is
1:50:1	1:50:5	g	and
1:50:19	1:50:24	g	IY got that 
1:50:29	1:50:36	g	IY re going like
1:52:35	1:52:40	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
1:53:58	1:54:4	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
1:54:19	1:54:21	g	well just
1:54:22	1:54:27	f	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
1:56:30	1:56:30	g	ok
2:0:1	2:0:2	g	uhm
2:0:59	2:1:1	g	probably the same thing
2:3:20	2:3:29	g	then
2:4:2	2:4:5	g	so IY go three inches straight
2:5:10	2:5:14	g	uhm
2:5:27	2:5:31	f	yeah IY see that
2:7:2	2:7:5	g	ok
2:8:0	2:8:2	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
2:8:27	2:8:31	g	ok
2:8:37	2:8:40	f	and curve down to the left 
2:8:49	2:8:49	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
2:9:34	2:9:39	g	like
2:10:50	2:10:50	g	what 
2:11:0	2:11:9	g	like maybe an inch
2:11:43	2:11:49	g	and IY should have a straight line there
2:12:10	2:12:16	g	ok
2:16:34	2:16:43	g	ok
2:17:4	2:17:5	g	and then
2:17:2	2:17:5	g	straight up
2:17:30	2:17:37	f	up tp the right
2:19:22	2:19:28	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
2:24:10	2:24:10	g	there s a there s  
2:24:28	2:24:34	f	so wait
2:26:31	2:26:37	g	after IY slope down IY d say
2:29:20	2:29:26	g	it s not a big curve
2:29:43	2:29:50	f	and to the right 
2:33:7	2:33:7	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
2:33:11	2:33:19	g	uhm
2:33:34	2:33:35	g	and 
2:34:26	2:34:26	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
2:35:58	2:36:4	f	ok
2:38:45	2:38:46	g	and then
2:40:2	2:40:4	g	and then IY go straight
2:40:43	2:40:45	g	IY wanna kind of curve
2:41:42	2:41:49	g	uhm
2:42:4	2:42:4	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
2:44:23	2:44:27	g	and then IY  IY go up
2:45:7	2:45:15	g	uhm
2:45:21	2:45:22	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right
2:45:40	2:45:41	f	ok
2:45:42	2:45:44	g	are IY anywhere near there 
2:46:13	2:46:17	g	they re there
2:46:43	2:46:47	g	ok
2:46:57	2:47:5	g	hmm
2:47:17	2:47:20	g	well
2:47:34	2:47:42	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
2:48:39	2:48:48	g	IY slope down again
2:48:49	2:48:49	g	ok
2:50:39	2:50:41	g	alright alright well just
2:51:16	2:51:22	g	ok well
2:51:35	2:51:38	g	and then IY re going down
2:52:9	2:52:16	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
2:52:36	2:52:38	g	well
2:53:19	2:53:23	g	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
2:54:48	2:54:52	g	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
3:0:7	3:0:7	g	uhm
3:0:18	3:0:19	f	IY have to back up a little bit
3:1:59	3:2:4	g	like
3:5:38	3:5:39	f	do IY go through anything 
3:8:10	3:8:11	g	and
3:9:42	3:9:43	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
3:12:20	3:12:25	g	ok
3:13:16	3:13:18	g	and then IY slope up
3:13:38	3:13:45	g	maybe like
3:14:54	3:14:54	g	but
3:15:7	3:15:10	g	IY re kind of going  
3:15:32	3:15:37	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
3:17:27	3:17:33	g	what 
3:17:44	3:17:46	f	and
3:21:13	3:21:14	g	kind of across from stony desert
3:22:0	3:22:1	g	like three inches 
3:23:46	3:23:46	g	and IY re going
3:24:14	3:24:17	f	IY know IY have different things so
3:25:8	3:25:11	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
3:25:13	3:25:20	g	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
3:26:38	3:26:44	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
3:27:34	3:27:36	g	IY re starting
3:28:4	3:28:5	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
3:27:59	3:28:6	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
3:29:2	3:29:11	g	ok
3:29:25	3:29:30	f	mm hmm
3:30:21	3:30:25	g	and then IY go
3:30:32	3:30:37	f	ok
3:35:33	3:35:33	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
3:36:34	3:36:37	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
3:38:9	3:38:11	f	IY hit some rocks though
3:41:23	3:41:24	g	ok IY re at the savannah
3:41:28	3:41:33	g	alright 
3:41:37	3:41:37	g	from
3:42:43	3:42:43	g	ok
3:43:17	3:43:24	g	to the white mountain
3:43:38	3:43:38	f	yeah
3:43:54	3:43:58	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
3:44:8	3:44:8	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
3:44:17	3:44:20	g	slight
3:44:17	3:44:22	g	ok
3:46:5	3:46:8	g	to the left
3:46:10	3:46:11	f	around the lake to the top 
3:46:41	3:46:49	f	uhm IY
3:47:1	3:47:9	f	IY ve a plane crash though
3:49:51	3:49:52	g	like
3:50:16	3:50:20	g	for about two inches
3:51:21	3:51:27	f	nope IY have a white mountain
3:56:31	3:56:36	g	ok
3:58:35	3:58:43	g	uhm
3:59:10	3:59:16	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
4:0:8	4:0:14	f	yeah and IY went straight up
4:0:35	4:0:37	g	uh like
4:1:19	4:1:25	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
4:2:17	4:2:20	g	four or five inches to the left
4:3:30	4:3:36	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
4:5:6	4:5:9	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
4:8:4	4:8:8	g	after the circle
4:10:4	4:10:6	g	like four or five inches to the left
4:10:13	4:10:19	g	no
4:10:42	4:10:50	g	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
4:11:23	4:11:26	g	three inches
4:12:40	4:12:47	g	uhm
4:12:45	4:12:53	g	to the right
4:14:17	4:14:19	g	and then IY slope
4:14:41	4:14:50	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
4:15:18	4:15:27	g	so IY re at the hot springs
4:16:21	4:16:26	g	yes IY re going towards the lake
4:16:45	4:16:47	g	maybe IY have different things
4:16:52	4:17:0	g	ok
4:17:51	4:17:58	g	so that s about IY would say
4:18:35	4:18:39	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
4:20:28	4:20:33	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
4:21:17	4:21:17	g	like
4:22:7	4:22:8	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
4:25:4	4:25:9	g	three inches straight across
4:29:4	4:29:10	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
4:30:37	4:30:39	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
4:30:33	4:30:40	f	yeah 
4:31:14	4:31:15	g	uhhh no
4:32:8	4:32:11	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
4:32:32	4:32:38	g	alright 
4:33:57	4:33:59	f	oh
4:35:51	4:35:52	g	uhm
4:38:51	4:39:0	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
4:39:41	4:39:47	g	and then
4:39:59	4:40:8	g	to the lake 
4:41:17	4:41:19	g	you
4:42:29	4:42:37	f	ok
4:43:1	4:43:4	g	the  
4:44:6	4:44:9	g	have a s 
4:46:26	4:46:32	g	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
4:47:9	4:47:10	g	after plane crash
4:48:44	4:48:49	g	that s about five or six inches
4:52:42	4:52:42	f	yeah
4:52:46	4:52:51	g	IY re sloping
4:54:19	4:54:27	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
4:54:52	4:54:57	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
4:55:42	4:55:50	g	so IY make that circle
4:56:2	4:56:9	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
4:56:18	4:56:18	g	ok
4:56:47	4:56:51	f	ok
4:56:48	4:56:57	g	for like
4:57:28	4:57:35	g	ok
4:57:49	4:57:56	g	IY re starting at the stony desert
4:58:7	4:58:10	f	ok
4:59:39	4:59:40	g	and IY re sloping to the left
5:0:7	5:0:13	g	are IY anywere near there 
5:2:11	5:2:19	g	and 
5:6:3	5:6:12	f	yeah 
5:6:25	5:6:34	g	IY plane crash 
5:6:55	5:7:1	g	IY would say
5:7:14	5:7:23	f	ok
5:9:56	5:10:1	f	IY hit some round rocks
5:9:54	5:10:2	g	maybe four inches on the paper
5:10:53	5:10:53	f	ok
5:11:36	5:11:39	g	and then
5:11:59	5:12:2	f	yeah
5:12:15	5:12:21	f	ok
5:12:35	5:12:38	g	for like

5:17:51	5:17:56	f	ok
5:23:19	5:23:22	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
5:23:58	5:24:2	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
5:24:29	5:24:37	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
5:26:16	5:26:24	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
5:27:26	5:27:34	g	just do it like this ok
5:28:50	5:28:52	f	ok
5:28:56	5:29:1	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
5:30:8	5:30:11	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
5:30:27	5:30:35	f	yeah
5:32:27	5:32:36	f	and then what 
5:33:15	5:33:18	f	ok

5:40:1	5:40:3	g	ok
5:42:12	5:42:13	g	IY just kind of slope down
5:43:4	5:43:6	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
5:47:42	5:47:48	f	ok
5:48:32	5:48:41	g	uhm
5:48:55	5:49:1	f	ok wait hold on
5:49:38	5:49:41	g	uhm
5:52:6	5:52:6	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
5:53:41	5:53:45	g	ok
5:53:37	5:53:46	g	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
5:53:50	5:53:55	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
5:54:20	5:54:27	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
5:54:37	5:54:39	f	 IY m at the savannah
5:59:45	5:59:49	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
6:3:37	6:3:43	f	to the left of the antelope
6:4:36	6:4:38	f	ok
6:4:56	6:5:3	g	couple miles or something
6:5:24	6:5:33	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
6:5:53	6:5:57	g	and IY re going up like
6:5:55	6:6:2	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
6:6:52	6:6:52	f	around the top of the lake 
6:7:13	6:7:19	g	no
6:7:37	6:7:41	g	just a slight slope
6:11:5	6:11:6	g	ok
6:11:5	6:11:8	f	how many inches do IY think 
6:11:56	6:11:59	g	IY re at the plane crash
6:12:24	6:12:31	g	ok
