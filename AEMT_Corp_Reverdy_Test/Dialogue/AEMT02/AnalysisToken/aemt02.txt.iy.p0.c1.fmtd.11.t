start
start g
0	0:0:48	0:0:56	ok
1	0:1:2	0:1:5	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
3	0:1:44	0:1:51	well
6	0:4:20	0:4:22	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
7	0:4:39	0:4:44	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
8	0:4:36	0:4:44	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
10	0:11:11	0:11:19	uhm
11	0:12:19	0:12:19	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
12	0:12:26	0:12:29	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
13	0:13:28	0:13:37	ok IY re at the savannah
15	0:15:5	0:15:14	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
16	0:15:22	0:15:30	to the left
17	0:18:26	0:18:27	it s not a big curve
18	0:19:24	0:19:26	IY re starting at the stony desert
20	0:19:59	0:20:1	like
21	0:22:27	0:22:32	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
24	0:26:55	0:26:58	and then
25	0:28:44	0:28:51	maybe
26	0:30:48	0:30:53	no IY have  
27	0:32:3	0:32:7	are IY  
30	0:35:29	0:35:38	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
31	0:35:52	0:35:56	that s about five or six inches
32	0:36:55	0:36:56	no IY don t have a waterhole
33	0:36:55	0:37:1	uhm
35	0:37:12	0:37:17	to IY right 
37	0:40:35	0:40:36	ok
38	0:41:10	0:41:11	so IY make that circle
39	0:44:30	0:44:31	slight
40	0:44:34	0:44:43	so IY go three inches straight
41	0:44:53	0:44:54	they re there
42	0:45:7	0:45:14	an inch maybe a little bit less
43	0:46:9	0:46:12	ok
44	0:47:40	0:47:42	ok
45	0:51:51	0:51:58	and then
47	0:55:39	0:55:46	well just
49	1:1:2	1:1:4	four or five inches to the left
52	1:2:32	1:2:36	ok
55	1:9:2	1:9:3	and then
56	1:9:34	1:9:36	and then IY go straight
57	1:9:54	1:9:58	uhm
59	1:11:58	1:12:6	IY re sloping
60	1:12:55	1:13:2	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
61	1:13:14	1:13:18	ok
62	1:13:27	1:13:30	after that IY go straight again
64	1:15:21	1:15:27	three inches
66	1:19:22	1:19:27	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
67	1:19:29	1:19:30	like an inch
68	1:21:24	1:21:28	there s a there s  
72	1:26:12	1:26:19	and then
74	1:27:45	1:27:50	ok
75	1:28:21	1:28:22	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
77	1:30:56	1:30:59	no
78	1:31:50	1:31:55	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
79	1:32:51	1:32:59	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
80	1:33:44	1:33:52	IY wanna kind of curve
81	1:35:47	1:35:47	and IY just go straight up
82	1:36:16	1:36:23	just a slight slope
84	1:36:30	1:36:32	uhm
85	1:37:44	1:37:53	and then
86	1:38:30	1:38:35	and it slopes a little bit to the right
87	1:39:22	1:39:31	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
88	1:40:27	1:40:28	not right at the stony desert
89	1:46:1	1:46:2	IY re actually starting like right
90	1:46:19	1:46:19	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
92	1:46:31	1:46:40	ok
93	1:46:46	1:46:52	about like
94	1:47:46	1:47:48	are IY in like almost the top of the
95	1:48:24	1:48:31	and then
96	1:51:45	1:51:50	yes
97	1:52:2	1:52:8	from
98	1:53:45	1:53:50	ok well
99	1:55:36	1:55:39	maybe like
100	1:57:11	1:57:13	uhm
101	1:57:56	1:58:3	ok
102	2:3:10	2:3:12	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
103	2:4:6	2:4:9	IY re going about
104	2:4:13	2:4:22	maybe IY have different things
105	2:5:48	2:5:48	maybe four inches on the paper
106	2:6:15	2:6:19	so that s about IY would say
107	2:6:52	2:7:0	and IY re going straight up
108	2:9:1	2:9:6	like four or five inches to the left
110	2:9:49	2:9:54	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
111	2:10:36	2:10:40	for about two inches
112	2:10:43	2:10:47	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
113	2:11:16	2:11:18	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
114	2:12:1	2:12:9	yes
115	2:13:1	2:13:4	uhm and there is a stony desert
116	2:14:15	2:14:22	the  
117	2:15:32	2:15:39	so IY re at the hot springs
122	2:20:16	2:20:22	IY make
124	2:22:40	2:22:41	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
126	2:24:57	2:25:0	hmm
127	2:25:34	2:25:40	like
131	2:30:47	2:30:50	yes IY re going towards the lake
132	2:30:51	2:30:53	uhm
133	2:32:52	2:32:59	IY plane crash 
134	2:34:47	2:34:48	uhm
135	2:36:19	2:36:27	so
136	2:36:44	2:36:47	no
137	2:38:7	2:38:13	to the left
138	2:38:22	2:38:31	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
139	2:38:57	2:38:58	well
140	2:38:59	2:39:5	like IY re sloping
141	2:39:6	2:39:14	what 
143	2:39:55	2:40:4	for like
144	2:40:38	2:40:45	ok
147	2:44:5	2:44:7	ok well
148	2:44:4	2:44:13	a little
150	2:45:7	2:45:8	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
151	2:45:32	2:45:33	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
152	2:46:51	2:46:51	have a s 
153	2:48:7	2:48:12	alright alright well just
155	2:49:44	2:49:46	uhm
156	2:51:26	2:51:35	after plane crash
158	2:55:24	2:55:32	uhhh no
159	2:55:51	2:55:57	and then IY slope up
160	2:58:9	2:58:16	and then
161	2:59:9	2:59:13	like maybe an inch
162	3:1:59	3:2:4	IY would say
164	3:2:26	3:2:34	do IY have roman baths 
165	3:5:15	3:5:23	three inches straight across
166	3:5:46	3:5:52	ok
167	3:7:4	3:7:10	uhm
168	3:9:22	3:9:24	IY re going like
171	3:10:11	3:10:14	a quarter of an inch
172	3:10:19	3:10:26	ok
174	3:13:7	3:13:10	but
175	3:13:33	3:13:36	ok
177	3:14:43	3:14:43	and that s where the plane crash is
178	3:14:49	3:14:52	and is to the left
179	3:15:48	3:15:54	uhm
180	3:15:55	3:16:1	and
182	3:19:25	3:19:32	uh like
184	3:21:6	3:21:11	after the circle
185	3:23:8	3:23:8	it s right next to it
187	3:24:52	3:24:58	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
188	3:25:9	3:25:16	for like
189	3:27:1	3:27:1	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
190	3:27:11	3:27:13	ok
191	3:27:14	3:27:21	and 
192	3:31:36	3:31:45	alright 
193	3:33:43	3:33:47	ok 
195	3:39:15	3:39:15	alright well IY ll keep going and see
196	3:40:41	3:40:42	where IY re going down to a plane crash
197	3:41:42	3:41:50	couple inches IY re sloping down
198	3:42:10	3:42:12	uhm
199	3:42:42	3:42:47	maybe like
201	3:45:20	3:45:22	ok
204	3:49:28	3:49:28	to the left
205	3:49:56	3:49:58	are IY anywere near there 
206	3:50:4	3:50:13	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
208	3:56:9	3:56:12	well alright
209	3:57:53	3:57:56	IY re just going down
213	4:3:18	4:3:23	uhm
214	4:3:42	4:3:45	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
215	4:4:21	4:4:22	uhm
217	4:5:42	4:5:49	three inches
218	4:5:59	4:6:5	IY re starting
221	4:8:0	4:8:7	and then IY slope
222	4:8:21	4:8:28	ok
223	4:8:29	4:8:32	like
224	4:11:36	4:11:45	and IY re going

228	4:13:45	4:13:47	alright 
229	4:16:18	4:16:26	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
230	4:19:4	4:19:5	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
231	4:19:44	4:19:47	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
232	4:20:29	4:20:30	uhm
234	4:28:42	4:28:42	after IY slope down IY d say
235	4:30:40	4:30:45	and then
236	4:32:9	4:32:14	and IY should have a straight line there
237	4:32:15	4:32:23	IY slope down again
240	4:35:43	4:35:51	and there s a plane crash
241	4:38:13	4:38:21	IY re kind of going  
242	4:38:54	4:39:0	and IY re going up like
243	4:39:12	4:39:14	is the plane crash  
244	4:40:19	4:40:27	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
245	4:40:42	4:40:49	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
246	4:42:4	4:42:9	and then IY  IY go up
248	4:45:2	4:45:5	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
249	4:45:25	4:45:26	then
252	4:49:43	4:49:50	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
253	4:50:8	4:50:15	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
254	4:51:25	4:51:27	uhm
255	4:52:23	4:52:31	ok
259	4:56:33	4:56:41	IY got that 
260	4:56:48	4:56:52	ok
261	4:58:9	4:58:11	to the right
262	4:59:19	4:59:19	ok
263	5:2:58	5:2:58	and then IY are
264	5:5:45	5:5:45	IY move to the left
265	5:7:55	5:7:57	ok IY plane crash isn t there
266	5:8:48	5:8:56	that s IY little slope
267	5:9:17	5:9:19	ok
268	5:16:33	5:16:36	ok
269	5:19:47	5:19:48	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
270	5:20:52	5:20:59	go up like three  three and a half inches
272	5:24:3	5:24:12	and 
275	5:24:50	5:24:56	to the white mountain
276	5:25:38	5:25:46	ok
277	5:26:59	5:27:7	what 
278	5:27:25	5:27:31	straight up
279	5:27:58	5:28:2	and then IY slope down to the left
281	5:33:27	5:33:27	kind of across from stony desert
282	5:33:50	5:33:53	and then IY go
283	5:34:59	5:35:2	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
284	5:35:45	5:35:50	on IY sheet anyway
285	5:36:47	5:36:50	and IY re sloping to the left
286	5:39:58	5:40:7	alright are IY starting  near the  
287	5:40:52	5:40:55	and then IY re going down
288	5:40:53	5:41:2	IY just kind of slope down
289	5:42:3	5:42:12	around the bottom of it
291	5:42:34	5:42:43	ok
293	5:43:35	5:43:40	ok and then IY re going
294	5:43:41	5:43:47	are IY in like   
295	5:48:21	5:48:24	couple miles or something
296	5:49:46	5:49:49	and IY go to the left a little bit
297	5:49:56	5:50:4	are IY anywhere near there 
298	5:50:30	5:50:36	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
299	5:51:19	5:51:26	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
301	5:53:44	5:53:50	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
302	6:2:7	6:2:12	five
303	6:4:1	6:4:7	like three inches 
305	6:4:28	6:4:37	and
306	6:6:53	6:7:2	just do it like this ok
307	6:7:23	6:7:29	uhm
312	6:17:1	6:17:3	and IY slope is about an inch long
313	6:17:41	6:17:48	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
314	6:20:56	6:20:59	like
317	6:24:24	6:24:33	IY re at the plane crash
319	6:25:38	6:25:42	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
320	6:26:51	6:26:54	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
321	6:27:3	6:27:12	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
322	6:31:7	6:31:8	to the lake 
323	6:31:37	6:31:41	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
324	6:32:18	6:32:18	and then IY ll come to a savannah
325	6:32:45	6:32:46	no IY don t have any rocks
329	6:35:3	6:35:10	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
330	6:36:11	6:36:20	ok
331	6:37:16	6:37:22	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
332	6:37:32	6:37:32	probably the same thing
334	6:39:12	6:39:18	IY don t know
335	6:39:16	6:39:19	so anyway
338	6:43:37	6:43:44	and IY go down IY slope to the right
339	6:46:28	6:46:33	you
340	6:47:12	6:47:15	the slate mountain is towards the right
341	6:47:18	6:47:21	IY go straight down
342	6:47:28	6:47:32	a little bit too
start f
2	0:1:19	0:1:22	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
4	0:3:8	0:3:13	ok
5	0:3:46	0:3:48	ok
9	0:7:3	0:7:12	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
14	0:15:2	0:15:3	do IY go through anything 
19	0:19:24	0:19:27	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
22	0:25:10	0:25:15	ok
23	0:25:57	0:25:58	ok
28	0:32:36	0:32:44	and then what 
29	0:34:40	0:34:48	nope IY have a white mountain
34	0:37:1	0:37:8	yeah IY see that
36	0:37:42	0:37:43	ok
46	0:55:7	0:55:10	IY hit some round rocks
48	0:59:33	0:59:34	ok
50	1:2:5	1:2:5	mm hmm
51	1:2:19	1:2:22	 IY m at the savannah
53	1:3:13	1:3:18	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
54	1:5:25	1:5:31	ok
58	1:10:1	1:10:7	around the top of the lake 
63	1:15:19	1:15:24	ok
65	1:16:5	1:16:11	and curve down to the left 
69	1:23:50	1:23:57	to 
70	1:24:19	1:24:22	IY ve a plane crash though
71	1:25:33	1:25:35	elephants 
73	1:26:49	1:26:56	ok
76	1:29:43	1:29:46	do IY go by the plane crash 
83	1:36:18	1:36:27	ok
91	1:46:29	1:46:38	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
109	2:9:36	2:9:44	mm hmm
118	2:15:43	2:15:50	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
119	2:16:33	2:16:36	yeah
120	2:18:9	2:18:15	around the lake to the top 
121	2:19:44	2:19:45	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
123	2:21:57	2:22:5	mm hmm
125	2:24:4	2:24:6	ok
128	2:28:3	2:28:12	ok
129	2:28:41	2:28:48	ok
130	2:30:8	2:30:14	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
142	2:39:30	2:39:36	so wait
145	2:41:36	2:41:36	IY know IY have different things so
146	2:41:45	2:41:54	ok
149	2:44:51	2:44:52	how many inches do IY think 
154	2:48:35	2:48:36	mm hmm
157	2:52:40	2:52:42	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
163	3:2:11	3:2:16	yep
169	3:9:45	3:9:46	ok
170	3:10:6	3:10:7	yeah
173	3:12:22	3:12:28	and to the right 
176	3:14:30	3:14:30	mm hmm
181	3:16:52	3:16:55	ok
183	3:20:38	3:20:45	nope

194	3:34:54	3:35:1	yeah
200	3:45:15	3:45:17	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
202	3:45:52	3:45:58	mm  mm
203	3:48:19	3:48:28	to the left
207	3:52:14	3:52:14	uh IY don t know know what to say
210	3:59:21	3:59:28	uhm IY
211	4:0:55	4:1:1	IY hit some rocks though
212	4:2:45	4:2:46	yeah and IY went straight up
216	4:4:24	4:4:27	ok
219	4:6:19	4:6:25	so IY go to the left of the antelope
220	4:7:4	4:7:8	ok
226	4:12:44	4:12:52	IY go to a lake 
233	4:22:2	4:22:11	yeah 
238	4:32:35	4:32:43	IY have to back up a little bit
239	4:33:46	4:33:54	ok
247	4:43:37	4:43:41	yeah
250	4:45:27	4:45:30	IY m three inches above the savannah
251	4:45:47	4:45:49	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
256	4:52:24	4:52:32	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
257	4:53:25	4:53:31	yeah
258	4:55:2	4:55:4	ok
271	5:21:35	5:21:41	and there s a collapsed shelter
273	5:24:15	5:24:17	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
274	5:24:18	5:24:27	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
280	5:28:51	5:28:55	ok
290	5:42:7	5:42:15	to the right 
292	5:43:16	5:43:24	mm hmm
300	5:52:52	5:52:56	yeah 
304	6:4:32	6:4:33	do IY go around it 
308	6:8:45	6:8:52	ok
309	6:9:6	6:9:14	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
310	6:13:15	6:13:22	ok
311	6:16:57	6:17:1	ok
315	6:21:10	6:21:19	and
316	6:21:32	6:21:38	ok
318	6:24:48	6:24:53	ok
326	6:33:25	6:33:25	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
327	6:33:59	6:34:0	up tp the right
328	6:33:54	6:34:3	ok
333	6:37:31	6:37:38	to the left of the antelope
336	6:41:50	6:41:54	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
337	6:42:19	6:42:27	oh
start g
0	0:0:48	0:0:56	ok
1	0:1:2	0:1:5	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
3	0:1:44	0:1:51	well
6	0:4:20	0:4:22	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
7	0:4:39	0:4:44	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
8	0:4:36	0:4:44	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
10	0:11:11	0:11:19	uhm
11	0:12:19	0:12:19	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
12	0:12:26	0:12:29	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
13	0:13:28	0:13:37	ok IY re at the savannah
15	0:15:5	0:15:14	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
16	0:15:22	0:15:30	to the left
17	0:18:26	0:18:27	it s not a big curve
18	0:19:24	0:19:26	IY re starting at the stony desert
20	0:19:59	0:20:1	like
21	0:22:27	0:22:32	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
24	0:26:55	0:26:58	and then
25	0:28:44	0:28:51	maybe
26	0:30:48	0:30:53	no IY have  
27	0:32:3	0:32:7	are IY  
30	0:35:29	0:35:38	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
31	0:35:52	0:35:56	that s about five or six inches
32	0:36:55	0:36:56	no IY don t have a waterhole
33	0:36:55	0:37:1	uhm
35	0:37:12	0:37:17	to IY right 
37	0:40:35	0:40:36	ok
38	0:41:10	0:41:11	so IY make that circle
39	0:44:30	0:44:31	slight
40	0:44:34	0:44:43	so IY go three inches straight
41	0:44:53	0:44:54	they re there
42	0:45:7	0:45:14	an inch maybe a little bit less
43	0:46:9	0:46:12	ok
44	0:47:40	0:47:42	ok
45	0:51:51	0:51:58	and then
47	0:55:39	0:55:46	well just
49	1:1:2	1:1:4	four or five inches to the left
52	1:2:32	1:2:36	ok
55	1:9:2	1:9:3	and then
56	1:9:34	1:9:36	and then IY go straight
57	1:9:54	1:9:58	uhm
59	1:11:58	1:12:6	IY re sloping
60	1:12:55	1:13:2	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
61	1:13:14	1:13:18	ok
62	1:13:27	1:13:30	after that IY go straight again
64	1:15:21	1:15:27	three inches
66	1:19:22	1:19:27	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
67	1:19:29	1:19:30	like an inch
68	1:21:24	1:21:28	there s a there s  
72	1:26:12	1:26:19	and then
74	1:27:45	1:27:50	ok
75	1:28:21	1:28:22	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
77	1:30:56	1:30:59	no
78	1:31:50	1:31:55	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
79	1:32:51	1:32:59	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
80	1:33:44	1:33:52	IY wanna kind of curve
81	1:35:47	1:35:47	and IY just go straight up
82	1:36:16	1:36:23	just a slight slope
84	1:36:30	1:36:32	uhm
85	1:37:44	1:37:53	and then
86	1:38:30	1:38:35	and it slopes a little bit to the right
87	1:39:22	1:39:31	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
88	1:40:27	1:40:28	not right at the stony desert
89	1:46:1	1:46:2	IY re actually starting like right
90	1:46:19	1:46:19	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
92	1:46:31	1:46:40	ok
93	1:46:46	1:46:52	about like
94	1:47:46	1:47:48	are IY in like almost the top of the
95	1:48:24	1:48:31	and then
96	1:51:45	1:51:50	yes
97	1:52:2	1:52:8	from
98	1:53:45	1:53:50	ok well
99	1:55:36	1:55:39	maybe like
100	1:57:11	1:57:13	uhm
101	1:57:56	1:58:3	ok
102	2:3:10	2:3:12	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
103	2:4:6	2:4:9	IY re going about
104	2:4:13	2:4:22	maybe IY have different things
105	2:5:48	2:5:48	maybe four inches on the paper
106	2:6:15	2:6:19	so that s about IY would say
107	2:6:52	2:7:0	and IY re going straight up
108	2:9:1	2:9:6	like four or five inches to the left
110	2:9:49	2:9:54	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
111	2:10:36	2:10:40	for about two inches
112	2:10:43	2:10:47	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
113	2:11:16	2:11:18	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
114	2:12:1	2:12:9	yes
115	2:13:1	2:13:4	uhm and there is a stony desert
116	2:14:15	2:14:22	the  
117	2:15:32	2:15:39	so IY re at the hot springs
122	2:20:16	2:20:22	IY make
124	2:22:40	2:22:41	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
126	2:24:57	2:25:0	hmm
127	2:25:34	2:25:40	like
131	2:30:47	2:30:50	yes IY re going towards the lake
132	2:30:51	2:30:53	uhm
133	2:32:52	2:32:59	IY plane crash 
134	2:34:47	2:34:48	uhm
135	2:36:19	2:36:27	so
136	2:36:44	2:36:47	no
137	2:38:7	2:38:13	to the left
138	2:38:22	2:38:31	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
139	2:38:57	2:38:58	well
140	2:38:59	2:39:5	like IY re sloping
141	2:39:6	2:39:14	what 
143	2:39:55	2:40:4	for like
144	2:40:38	2:40:45	ok
147	2:44:5	2:44:7	ok well
148	2:44:4	2:44:13	a little
150	2:45:7	2:45:8	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
151	2:45:32	2:45:33	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
152	2:46:51	2:46:51	have a s 
153	2:48:7	2:48:12	alright alright well just
155	2:49:44	2:49:46	uhm
156	2:51:26	2:51:35	after plane crash
158	2:55:24	2:55:32	uhhh no
159	2:55:51	2:55:57	and then IY slope up
160	2:58:9	2:58:16	and then
161	2:59:9	2:59:13	like maybe an inch
162	3:1:59	3:2:4	IY would say
164	3:2:26	3:2:34	do IY have roman baths 
165	3:5:15	3:5:23	three inches straight across
166	3:5:46	3:5:52	ok
167	3:7:4	3:7:10	uhm
168	3:9:22	3:9:24	IY re going like
171	3:10:11	3:10:14	a quarter of an inch
172	3:10:19	3:10:26	ok
174	3:13:7	3:13:10	but
175	3:13:33	3:13:36	ok
177	3:14:43	3:14:43	and that s where the plane crash is
178	3:14:49	3:14:52	and is to the left
179	3:15:48	3:15:54	uhm
180	3:15:55	3:16:1	and
182	3:19:25	3:19:32	uh like
184	3:21:6	3:21:11	after the circle
185	3:23:8	3:23:8	it s right next to it
187	3:24:52	3:24:58	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
188	3:25:9	3:25:16	for like
189	3:27:1	3:27:1	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
190	3:27:11	3:27:13	ok
191	3:27:14	3:27:21	and 
192	3:31:36	3:31:45	alright 
193	3:33:43	3:33:47	ok 
195	3:39:15	3:39:15	alright well IY ll keep going and see
196	3:40:41	3:40:42	where IY re going down to a plane crash
197	3:41:42	3:41:50	couple inches IY re sloping down
198	3:42:10	3:42:12	uhm
199	3:42:42	3:42:47	maybe like
201	3:45:20	3:45:22	ok
204	3:49:28	3:49:28	to the left
205	3:49:56	3:49:58	are IY anywere near there 
206	3:50:4	3:50:13	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
208	3:56:9	3:56:12	well alright
209	3:57:53	3:57:56	IY re just going down
213	4:3:18	4:3:23	uhm

215	4:4:21	4:4:22	uhm
217	4:5:42	4:5:49	three inches
218	4:5:59	4:6:5	IY re starting
221	4:8:0	4:8:7	and then IY slope
222	4:8:21	4:8:28	ok
223	4:8:29	4:8:32	like
224	4:11:36	4:11:45	and IY re going

228	4:13:45	4:13:47	alright 
229	4:16:18	4:16:26	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
230	4:19:4	4:19:5	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
231	4:19:44	4:19:47	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
232	4:20:29	4:20:30	uhm
234	4:28:42	4:28:42	after IY slope down IY d say
235	4:30:40	4:30:45	and then
236	4:32:9	4:32:14	and IY should have a straight line there
237	4:32:15	4:32:23	IY slope down again
240	4:35:43	4:35:51	and there s a plane crash
241	4:38:13	4:38:21	IY re kind of going  
242	4:38:54	4:39:0	and IY re going up like
243	4:39:12	4:39:14	is the plane crash  
244	4:40:19	4:40:27	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
245	4:40:42	4:40:49	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
246	4:42:4	4:42:9	and then IY  IY go up
248	4:45:2	4:45:5	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
249	4:45:25	4:45:26	then
252	4:49:43	4:49:50	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
253	4:50:8	4:50:15	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
254	4:51:25	4:51:27	uhm
255	4:52:23	4:52:31	ok
259	4:56:33	4:56:41	IY got that 
260	4:56:48	4:56:52	ok
261	4:58:9	4:58:11	to the right
262	4:59:19	4:59:19	ok
263	5:2:58	5:2:58	and then IY are
264	5:5:45	5:5:45	IY move to the left
265	5:7:55	5:7:57	ok IY plane crash isn t there
266	5:8:48	5:8:56	that s IY little slope
267	5:9:17	5:9:19	ok
268	5:16:33	5:16:36	ok
269	5:19:47	5:19:48	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
270	5:20:52	5:20:59	go up like three  three and a half inches
272	5:24:3	5:24:12	and 
275	5:24:50	5:24:56	to the white mountain
276	5:25:38	5:25:46	ok
277	5:26:59	5:27:7	what 
278	5:27:25	5:27:31	straight up
279	5:27:58	5:28:2	and then IY slope down to the left
281	5:33:27	5:33:27	kind of across from stony desert
282	5:33:50	5:33:53	and then IY go
283	5:34:59	5:35:2	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
284	5:35:45	5:35:50	on IY sheet anyway
285	5:36:47	5:36:50	and IY re sloping to the left
286	5:39:58	5:40:7	alright are IY starting  near the  
287	5:40:52	5:40:55	and then IY re going down
288	5:40:53	5:41:2	IY just kind of slope down
289	5:42:3	5:42:12	around the bottom of it
291	5:42:34	5:42:43	ok
293	5:43:35	5:43:40	ok and then IY re going
294	5:43:41	5:43:47	are IY in like   
295	5:48:21	5:48:24	couple miles or something
296	5:49:46	5:49:49	and IY go to the left a little bit
297	5:49:56	5:50:4	are IY anywhere near there 
298	5:50:30	5:50:36	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
299	5:51:19	5:51:26	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
301	5:53:44	5:53:50	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
302	6:2:7	6:2:12	five
303	6:4:1	6:4:7	like three inches 
305	6:4:28	6:4:37	and
306	6:6:53	6:7:2	just do it like this ok
307	6:7:23	6:7:29	uhm
312	6:17:1	6:17:3	and IY slope is about an inch long
313	6:17:41	6:17:48	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
314	6:20:56	6:20:59	like
317	6:24:24	6:24:33	IY re at the plane crash
319	6:25:38	6:25:42	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
320	6:26:51	6:26:54	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
321	6:27:3	6:27:12	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
322	6:31:7	6:31:8	to the lake 
323	6:31:37	6:31:41	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
324	6:32:18	6:32:18	and then IY ll come to a savannah
