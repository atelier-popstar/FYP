start
0:0:54	0:0:57	f	nope IY have a white mountain

0:8:55	0:9:0	g	and then
0:9:39	0:9:45	g	IY re at the plane crash
0:10:50	0:10:53	g	IY re starting at the stony desert
0:10:59	0:11:5	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
0:11:28	0:11:33	g	so that s about IY would say
0:14:16	0:14:25	g	uhm and there is a stony desert

0:38:32	0:38:36	g	around the bottom of it
0:39:2	0:39:6	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
0:39:15	0:39:22	g	IY move to the left
0:40:0	0:40:1	f	to the right 
0:40:20	0:40:27	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
0:41:33	0:41:39	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
0:44:38	0:44:41	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
0:45:27	0:45:28	f	do IY go around it 
0:46:1	0:46:9	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
0:46:25	0:46:26	g	so IY go three inches straight
0:46:35	0:46:40	g	uhm
0:48:21	0:48:30	g	and then IY slope up
0:50:42	0:50:43	g	uhm

0:52:29	0:52:35	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
0:54:40	0:54:49	f	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
0:55:55	0:55:57	g	ok
0:56:12	0:56:12	f	ok
0:56:10	0:56:16	g	like IY re sloping
0:57:33	0:57:38	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
0:58:8	0:58:17	g	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
0:58:46	0:58:46	f	and to the right 
0:59:53	0:59:57	g	what 
1:0:18	1:0:26	g	like
1:0:50	1:0:56	g	like
1:1:49	1:1:51	f	mm hmm
1:2:36	1:2:44	g	like four or five inches to the left
1:4:23	1:4:26	g	a quarter of an inch
1:7:58	1:8:4	g	ok
1:9:37	1:9:38	g	uhm
1:9:38	1:9:41	g	no

1:11:35	1:11:36	f	ok
1:12:16	1:12:20	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
1:13:14	1:13:15	g	well
1:13:31	1:13:32	g	and then
1:14:41	1:14:48	g	after the circle
1:15:14	1:15:16	g	ok
1:17:55	1:17:58	g	uhm
1:18:1	1:18:2	g	and then IY are
1:18:25	1:18:33	g	to IY right 
1:20:15	1:20:17	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
1:21:39	1:21:45	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
1:25:36	1:25:39	g	ok
1:26:18	1:26:20	g	do IY have roman baths 
1:26:28	1:26:31	g	ok
1:27:26	1:27:30	f	IY have to back up a little bit
1:27:53	1:28:2	f	ok
1:28:24	1:28:26	g	there s a there s  
1:28:57	1:29:3	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
1:29:6	1:29:6	g	and IY just go straight up
1:30:1	1:30:1	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
1:31:55	1:31:56	g	and then
1:31:55	1:32:1	f	ok
1:32:23	1:32:28	g	and then IY slope
1:38:18	1:38:18	f	to the left
1:38:43	1:38:52	g	and then IY go straight
1:39:5	1:39:12	g	and is to the left
1:41:23	1:41:24	f	ok
1:46:7	1:46:9	g	ok
1:47:32	1:47:32	g	ok

1:52:58	1:52:58	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
1:54:46	1:54:55	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
1:55:39	1:55:48	f	ok
1:56:32	1:56:38	g	ok IY re at the savannah
1:57:2	1:57:7	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
1:57:15	1:57:16	f	mm hmm
2:2:58	2:3:0	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
2:3:12	2:3:20	g	well just

2:4:2	2:4:11	g	uhm
2:4:26	2:4:34	g	ok
2:6:0	2:6:7	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
2:7:16	2:7:24	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
2:7:23	2:7:29	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
2:9:23	2:9:26	f	IY ve a plane crash though
2:9:28	2:9:31	g	and then IY re going down
2:12:37	2:12:41	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
2:13:20	2:13:28	g	ok
2:18:58	2:19:4	f	ok
2:19:15	2:19:20	g	no there s no elephants

2:22:1	2:22:4	g	alright 
2:22:13	2:22:15	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
2:23:20	2:23:27	g	and
2:24:37	2:24:40	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
2:24:36	2:24:43	g	for like
2:27:27	2:27:31	g	and 
2:27:44	2:27:50	g	and then

2:32:18	2:32:26	g	ok
2:33:56	2:34:2	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
2:34:26	2:34:33	g	three inches straight across
2:36:44	2:36:50	f	yeah
2:37:22	2:37:28	g	and
2:37:39	2:37:42	g	about like
2:39:48	2:39:55	g	couple miles or something
2:40:36	2:40:45	g	and IY re going straight up
2:41:33	2:41:34	g	yes
2:44:13	2:44:16	g	ok
2:44:49	2:44:55	f	IY hit some rocks though
2:46:47	2:46:54	g	straight up
2:50:54	2:50:59	g	after IY slope down IY d say
2:52:49	2:52:49	g	you
2:53:44	2:53:47	g	IY just kind of slope down
2:55:52	2:55:55	f	do IY go through anything 
2:58:44	2:58:47	g	IY would say
2:59:13	2:59:16	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
2:59:24	2:59:32	g	no IY have  
3:0:3	3:0:8	g	ok 
3:0:12	3:0:16	g	to the left
3:1:10	3:1:16	g	and then IY  IY go up
3:1:12	3:1:20	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
3:3:36	3:3:43	g	IY make
3:6:37	3:6:38	g	then
3:7:9	3:7:16	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
3:7:39	3:7:41	g	and IY re going up like
3:8:18	3:8:20	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
3:8:31	3:8:35	g	IY re starting
3:8:57	3:8:58	f	and curve down to the left 
3:12:0	3:12:4	f	ok
3:13:8	3:13:10	g	like maybe an inch
3:13:37	3:13:37	f	oh

3:19:50	3:19:55	f	ok
3:21:21	3:21:21	f	and
3:22:43	3:22:48	g	IY plane crash 
3:24:1	3:24:3	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
3:25:1	3:25:7	g	uhm
3:25:52	3:26:1	g	to the white mountain
3:28:15	3:28:24	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
3:30:7	3:30:16	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
3:32:2	3:32:2	g	and then
3:34:33	3:34:38	g	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
3:35:6	3:35:7	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
3:35:46	3:35:53	g	after that IY go straight again
3:37:30	3:37:31	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
3:39:4	3:39:5	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
3:39:20	3:39:22	g	alright 
3:40:51	3:40:57	f	ok
3:41:39	3:41:45	g	like an inch
3:41:58	3:42:5	g	probably the same thing
3:42:14	3:42:20	g	ok
3:42:44	3:42:50	f	ok
3:45:27	3:45:28	g	and then IY go
3:46:34	3:46:41	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
3:48:10	3:48:14	f	how many inches do IY think 
3:48:16	3:48:23	f	up tp the right
3:49:40	3:49:47	g	to the left
3:50:12	3:50:17	g	uhhh no
3:50:40	3:50:43	g	just a slight slope
3:54:46	3:54:55	f	ok
3:55:52	3:55:52	g	yes IY re going towards the lake
3:57:12	3:57:14	g	well alright
4:2:5	4:2:6	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
4:2:34	4:2:42	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
4:3:1	4:3:8	f	to 
4:4:27	4:4:27	g	maybe
4:5:59	4:6:2	g	uhm
4:6:28	4:6:30	g	uh like
4:6:28	4:6:31	g	is the plane crash  
4:7:4	4:7:6	g	five
4:9:36	4:9:39	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
4:10:55	4:10:56	g	so IY make that circle
4:12:32	4:12:35	g	IY wanna kind of curve
4:12:42	4:12:43	f	yep
4:13:14	4:13:21	f	mm hmm
4:13:29	4:13:33	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right
4:14:6	4:14:13	g	no
4:17:2	4:17:7	g	slight
4:21:22	4:21:22	g	ok and then IY re going
4:21:40	4:21:49	g	and IY re sloping to the left
4:22:4	4:22:8	g	for like
4:23:39	4:23:44	g	and then
4:24:25	4:24:27	g	IY go straight down
4:26:29	4:26:38	g	ok

4:28:15	4:28:15	f	mm  mm
4:29:5	4:29:7	g	kind of across from stony desert
4:30:47	4:30:55	g	yes
4:31:41	4:31:41	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
4:32:29	4:32:33	g	and then
4:33:30	4:33:32	g	ok
4:34:11	4:34:11	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
4:34:25	4:34:33	g	they re there
4:37:20	4:37:22	g	uhm
4:41:58	4:42:4	g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
4:42:11	4:42:11	g	ok
4:42:22	4:42:24	g	uhm
4:42:28	4:42:36	g	uhm
4:42:55	4:43:4	g	four or five inches to the left
4:44:46	4:44:47	f	IY hit some round rocks
4:45:1	4:45:9	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
4:45:42	4:45:46	g	so IY re at the hot springs
4:45:51	4:45:53	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
4:46:27	4:46:35	f	ok
4:46:43	4:46:43	g	no IY don t have any rocks
4:47:22	4:47:29	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
4:47:29	4:47:35	f	around the lake to the top 
4:47:43	4:47:48	g	and then
4:48:10	4:48:18	f	ok
4:48:35	4:48:39	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
4:48:46	4:48:48	g	are IY in like   
4:52:55	4:53:0	g	on IY sheet anyway
4:54:3	4:54:6	f	ok
4:55:42	4:55:50	g	and that s where the plane crash is
4:56:50	4:56:55	f	and then what 
4:57:5	4:57:12	g	not right at the stony desert
4:58:37	4:58:44	f	ok
5:3:32	5:3:35	g	well
5:4:53	5:5:2	g	ok
5:5:21	5:5:22	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
5:6:11	5:6:14	g	IY slope down again
5:7:40	5:7:47	g	ok
5:10:50	5:10:58	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
5:14:28	5:14:29	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
5:18:1	5:18:9	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
5:19:0	5:19:9	f	ok
5:21:26	5:21:30	f	yeah
5:22:32	5:22:34	g	ok
5:24:9	5:24:14	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
5:24:21	5:24:24	g	but
5:26:21	5:26:21	g	like three inches 
5:29:8	5:29:9	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
5:29:10	5:29:11	f	yeah 
5:29:22	5:29:22	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
5:33:5	5:33:11	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
5:33:35	5:33:38	f	ok
5:34:24	5:34:28	g	to the left
5:35:21	5:35:24	f	mm hmm
5:36:8	5:36:8	g	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
5:36:46	5:36:46	f	ok
5:37:26	5:37:30	g	a little bit too
5:38:30	5:38:34	f	ok
5:39:34	5:39:42	f	mm hmm
5:40:16	5:40:17	g	three inches
5:41:1	5:41:7	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
5:41:52	5:41:55	f	IY know IY have different things so
5:42:13	5:42:13	f	uh IY don t know know what to say
5:43:0	5:43:9	g	like
5:44:39	5:44:45	g	after plane crash
5:46:47	5:46:47	g	uhm
5:47:28	5:47:33	g	uhm
5:48:46	5:48:47	f	mm hmm
5:49:58	5:50:0	f	ok
5:50:13	5:50:13	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
5:51:7	5:51:12	g	maybe like
5:52:56	5:53:0	g	and there s a plane crash
5:53:17	5:53:17	g	to the right
5:53:26	5:53:29	g	and IY should have a straight line there
5:54:1	5:54:3	f	IY go to a lake 
5:55:10	5:55:19	g	IY got that 
5:55:31	5:55:36	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
5:59:57	6:0:5	g	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
6:1:30	6:1:38	f	to the left of the antelope
6:1:36	6:1:45	g	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
6:1:52	6:1:53	g	ok
6:2:16	6:2:17	g	ok
6:4:6	6:4:8	g	IY re going like
6:7:25	6:7:32	g	and IY go to the left a little bit
6:8:8	6:8:10	g	maybe like
6:8:22	6:8:27	g	ok
6:8:27	6:8:34	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
6:8:46	6:8:49	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
6:10:35	6:10:40	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
6:12:59	6:13:1	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
6:15:21	6:15:27	g	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
6:16:9	6:16:16	f	elephants 
6:17:39	6:17:41	g	that s IY little slope
6:19:52	6:20:1	g	for about two inches
6:20:44	6:20:47	f	ok
6:21:12	6:21:15	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
6:23:14	6:23:18	g	and then IY slope down to the left
6:24:47	6:24:48	f	ok wait hold on
