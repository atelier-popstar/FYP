6	1:8:24	1:10:5	kind of across from stony desert
7	1:10:5	1:11:36	and
8	1:11:36	1:13:19	IY re kind of going  
9	1:13:19	1:15:14	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
10	1:15:14	1:15:21	and IY re going
11	1:15:21	1:17:14	IY would say
12	1:17:14	1:19:3	maybe

15	1:21:51	1:23:32	uhm
16	1:23:32	1:24:16	where IY re going down to a plane crash
17	1:24:16	1:24:50	uhm
18	1:24:50	1:26:44	there s a there s  
20	1:28:14	1:28:56	ok

23	1:30:45	1:31:8	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
25	1:31:52	1:33:7	and IY go to the left a little bit
26	1:33:7	1:34:53	and then
27	1:34:53	1:36:22	uhm
28	1:36:22	1:37:38	IY just kind of slope down
29	1:37:38	1:38:58	a little bit too
30	1:38:58	1:40:12	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
31	1:40:12	1:41:12	after IY slope down IY d say
32	1:41:12	1:42:18	like
33	1:42:18	1:42:57	maybe like
34	1:42:57	1:44:3	couple inches IY re sloping down
35	1:44:3	1:45:1	and then IY go straight
36	1:45:1	1:45:36	for like
37	1:45:36	1:47:10	like
38	1:47:10	1:49:5	five
39	1:49:5	1:50:46	maybe four inches on the paper
40	1:50:46	1:51:42	and there s a plane crash
45	1:56:18	1:56:56	IY plane crash 
47	1:57:11	1:57:56	uhm
48	1:57:56	1:58:28	alright are IY starting  near the  
50	2:0:18	2:2:7	are IY  
51	2:2:7	2:2:57	IY re starting at the stony desert
53	2:4:13	2:5:6	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
55	2:6:43	2:8:33	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
56	2:8:33	2:10:10	not right at the stony desert
58	2:11:23	2:12:13	ok and then IY re going
60	2:13:1	2:14:4	to the left
61	2:14:4	2:15:1	like an inch
62	2:15:1	2:16:23	and then IY re going down
63	2:16:23	2:17:39	like maybe an inch
64	2:17:39	2:18:25	that s IY little slope
66	2:20:21	2:21:57	and then IY go
67	2:21:57	2:22:49	like four or five inches to the left
68	2:22:49	2:24:9	and that s where the plane crash is
69	2:24:9	2:26:7	are IY anywhere near there 
72	2:28:44	2:29:38	four or five inches to the left
74	2:29:38	2:31:9	and then
75	2:31:9	2:32:0	after plane crash
78	2:34:42	2:36:10	ok IY plane crash isn t there
79	2:36:10	2:36:27	uhm
80	2:36:27	2:38:9	alright well IY ll keep going and see
81	2:38:9	2:39:43	alright 
82	2:39:43	2:40:40	so
83	2:40:40	2:42:22	uhm
84	2:42:22	2:43:48	IY re at the plane crash
85	2:43:48	2:45:19	and
86	2:45:19	2:46:0	IY wanna kind of curve
87	2:46:0	2:46:54	a little
88	2:46:54	2:47:3	to the left
89	2:47:3	2:48:22	and then IY  IY go up
90	2:48:22	2:50:11	and IY re going up like
91	2:50:11	2:51:44	three inches
93	2:53:41	2:55:4	and 
94	2:55:4	2:55:32	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
95	2:55:32	2:56:20	it s not a big curve
97	2:57:59	2:58:36	ok
98	2:58:36	2:59:59	and then
99	2:59:59	3:0:11	uhm
100	3:0:11	3:2:7	after that IY go straight again
101	3:2:7	3:2:53	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
102	3:2:53	3:4:33	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
103	3:4:33	3:6:30	are IY anywere near there 
105	3:6:48	3:7:10	ok
107	3:7:22	3:8:26	yes
109	3:9:14	3:10:8	yes
111	3:10:8	3:12:5	ok
112	3:12:5	3:14:4	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
113	3:14:4	3:14:53	and IY go down IY slope to the right
114	3:14:53	3:15:22	just a slight slope
115	3:15:22	3:15:36	about like
116	3:15:36	3:17:21	an inch maybe a little bit less
118	3:17:34	3:18:20	to the right
119	3:18:20	3:19:46	IY re sloping
122	3:22:41	3:24:32	ok
123	3:24:32	3:26:25	and then
124	3:26:25	3:28:9	you
125	3:28:9	3:28:57	have a s 
126	3:28:57	3:29:42	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
127	3:29:42	3:30:41	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
129	3:31:29	3:32:44	slight
130	3:32:44	3:33:30	uhm
131	3:33:30	3:34:35	and then IY ll come to a savannah
133	3:35:31	3:37:17	ok
135	3:37:51	3:38:52	uhhh no
136	3:38:52	3:40:38	no IY don t have a waterhole
137	3:40:38	3:42:0	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
139	3:43:31	3:45:16	well
140	3:45:16	3:45:42	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
142	3:45:59	3:47:36	ok
144	3:48:29	3:49:34	ok IY re at the savannah
145	3:49:34	3:49:40	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
146	3:49:40	3:50:29	like
147	3:50:29	3:52:19	three inches
149	3:54:10	3:55:26	and IY re going straight up
150	3:55:26	3:56:13	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
152	3:57:26	3:58:35	ok well
153	3:58:35	3:58:41	probably the same thing
156	4:1:27	4:3:8	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
158	4:3:29	4:4:9	straight up
160	4:4:35	4:5:41	hmm
161	4:5:41	4:6:8	well
162	4:6:8	4:6:52	IY don t know
163	4:6:52	4:8:6	alright 
164	4:8:6	4:8:48	well just
166	4:10:46	4:12:3	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
167	4:12:3	4:12:24	the slate mountain is towards the right
168	4:12:24	4:13:24	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
169	4:13:24	4:14:13	are IY in like   
170	4:14:13	4:14:56	are IY in like almost the top of the
172	4:15:55	4:16:25	no IY have  
173	4:16:25	4:17:36	maybe IY have different things
174	4:17:36	4:17:46	well alright
176	4:18:21	4:19:58	alright alright well just
177	4:19:58	4:20:28	just do it like this ok
178	4:20:28	4:21:24	go up like three  three and a half inches
180	4:21:47	4:22:49	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
182	4:23:25	4:24:8	it s right next to it
183	4:24:8	4:24:15	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
185	4:25:56	4:27:46	maybe like
186	4:27:46	4:29:39	a quarter of an inch
187	4:29:39	4:30:39	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
190	4:31:48	4:32:6	ok
191	4:32:6	4:32:49	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
192	4:32:49	4:33:18	for like
193	4:33:18	4:34:14	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
195	4:36:0	4:36:32	and then IY slope down to the left
196	4:36:32	4:38:27	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
198	4:38:28	4:39:13	ok
199	4:39:13	4:41:7	and then
200	4:41:7	4:41:34	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
202	4:42:7	4:43:40	ok
203	4:43:40	4:45:13	so IY re at the hot springs
204	4:45:13	4:46:46	and IY re sloping to the left
205	4:46:46	4:46:50	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
207	4:47:51	4:49:35	ok
208	4:49:35	4:49:46	and then
209	4:49:46	4:50:40	uhm
210	4:50:40	4:52:26	IY slope down again
212	4:52:57	4:54:41	uhm
213	4:54:41	4:55:18	no there s no elephants
214	4:55:18	4:55:47	on IY sheet anyway
217	4:57:21	4:58:12	no
218	4:58:12	5:0:7	IY re just going down
219	5:0:7	5:1:34	like IY re sloping
220	5:1:34	5:1:59	and IY slope is about an inch long
221	5:1:59	5:2:22	and is to the left
223	5:4:15	5:4:50	ok
224	5:4:50	5:4:52	and then
225	5:4:52	5:5:8	uhm
226	5:5:8	5:6:14	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
227	5:6:14	5:7:23	to the left
229	5:8:25	5:10:9	ok
230	5:10:9	5:10:16	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
232	5:11:58	5:12:59	to the white mountain
234	5:14:52	5:16:28	ok 
235	5:16:28	5:17:3	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
236	5:17:3	5:18:53	and it slopes a little bit to the right
237	5:18:53	5:20:2	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
239	5:21:55	5:21:56	ok
240	5:21:56	5:23:24	so that s about IY would say
241	5:23:24	5:24:0	that s about five or six inches
243	5:24:49	5:26:45	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
245	5:27:10	5:27:34	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
246	5:27:34	5:28:55	and IY just go straight up
247	5:28:55	5:30:40	for about two inches
248	5:30:40	5:32:13	ok
250	5:33:6	5:33:58	then
252	5:34:34	5:35:1	no IY don t have any rocks
254	5:35:46	5:36:9	ok
256	5:37:39	5:38:59	ok
257	5:38:59	5:40:32	uhm
258	5:40:32	5:42:19	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
259	5:42:19	5:42:43	and then IY slope
260	5:42:43	5:42:43	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
262	5:44:0	5:44:33	yes IY re going towards the lake
264	5:45:53	5:46:18	but
265	5:46:18	5:47:21	IY re going about
266	5:47:21	5:47:48	three inches straight across
267	5:47:48	5:47:55	to the lake 
268	5:47:55	5:48:0	and then IY are
269	5:48:0	5:49:39	IY got that 
271	5:49:51	5:51:35	uhm
272	5:51:35	5:51:55	no
273	5:51:55	5:52:4	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
274	5:52:4	5:52:48	so IY go three inches straight
275	5:52:48	5:53:36	and then IY slope up
276	5:53:36	5:54:55	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
278	5:55:20	5:56:36	the  
279	5:56:36	5:56:54	what 
281	5:57:4	5:57:9	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
283	5:58:16	5:59:18	ok
284	5:59:18	6:1:15	and then
285	6:1:15	6:2:51	uhm
286	6:2:51	6:3:41	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
287	6:3:41	6:5:29	do IY have roman baths 
289	6:6:6	6:6:45	ok well
290	6:6:45	6:6:56	they re there
291	6:6:56	6:7:53	so anyway
292	6:7:53	6:9:5	IY make
294	6:10:34	6:11:43	what 
296	6:12:8	6:13:31	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
297	6:13:31	6:15:2	so IY make that circle
300	6:18:9	6:18:52	and 
301	6:18:52	6:18:53	after the circle
302	6:18:53	6:20:50	uhm
303	6:20:50	6:21:24	IY move to the left
304	6:21:24	6:22:23	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
306	6:23:46	6:24:49	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
307	6:24:49	6:26:5	like three inches 
308	6:26:5	6:27:48	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
310	6:28:12	6:28:59	ok
311	6:28:59	6:29:30	IY go straight down
312	6:29:30	6:31:14	uh like
313	6:31:14	6:32:31	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
316	6:35:5	6:36:26	uhm
318	6:37:54	6:39:49	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
320	6:39:58	6:40:11	is the plane crash  
321	6:40:11	6:41:31	like
322	6:41:31	6:42:42	to IY right 
325	6:44:53	6:46:38	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
327	6:46:56	6:47:27	IY re going like
329	6:48:4	6:48:38	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
330	6:48:38	6:50:6	and IY should have a straight line there
333	6:51:4	6:51:28	ok
334	6:51:28	6:52:26	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
336	6:52:34	6:52:47	around the bottom of it
338	6:54:35	6:54:39	ok
340	6:56:37	6:56:39	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
342	6:58:29	6:59:18	ok
start f
0	01:01:01	1:2:25	ok
19	1:26:44	1:28:14	ok wait hold on

42	1:51:51	1:53:13	uh IY don t know know what to say
43	1:53:13	1:54:55	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
44	1:54:55	1:56:18	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
46	1:56:56	1:57:11	mm  mm
49	1:58:28	2:0:18	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert

65	2:18:25	2:20:21	ok
70	2:26:7	2:27:31	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
71	2:27:31	2:28:44	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
73	2:29:38	2:29:38	ok
76	2:32:0	2:33:23	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
77	2:33:23	2:34:42	ok

39	1:49:5	1:50:46	maybe four inches on the paper
40	1:50:46	1:51:42	and there s a plane crash
45	1:56:18	1:56:56	IY plane crash 
47	1:57:11	1:57:56	uhm
48	1:57:56	1:58:28	alright are IY starting  near the  
50	2:0:18	2:2:7	are IY  
51	2:2:7	2:2:57	IY re starting at the stony desert
53	2:4:13	2:5:6	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
55	2:6:43	2:8:33	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
56	2:8:33	2:10:10	not right at the stony desert
58	2:11:23	2:12:13	ok and then IY re going
60	2:13:1	2:14:4	to the left
61	2:14:4	2:15:1	like an inch

63	2:16:23	2:17:39	like maybe an inch
64	2:17:39	2:18:25	that s IY little slope
66	2:20:21	2:21:57	and then IY go
67	2:21:57	2:22:49	like four or five inches to the left
68	2:22:49	2:24:9	and that s where the plane crash is
69	2:24:9	2:26:7	are IY anywhere near there 
72	2:28:44	2:29:38	four or five inches to the left
74	2:29:38	2:31:9	and then
75	2:31:9	2:32:0	after plane crash
78	2:34:42	2:36:10	ok IY plane crash isn t there
79	2:36:10	2:36:27	uhm
80	2:36:27	2:38:9	alright well IY ll keep going and see
81	2:38:9	2:39:43	alright

83	2:40:40	2:42:22	uhm
84	2:42:22	2:43:48	IY re at the plane crash
85	2:43:48	2:45:19	and
86	2:45:19	2:46:0	IY wanna kind of curve
87	2:46:0	2:46:54	a little
88	2:46:54	2:47:3	to the left
89	2:47:3	2:48:22	and then IY  IY go up

93	2:53:41	2:55:4	and 
94	2:55:4	2:55:32	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
95	2:55:32	2:56:20	it s not a big curve
97	2:57:59	2:58:36	ok
98	2:58:36	2:59:59	and then
99	2:59:59	3:0:11	uhm
100	3:0:11	3:2:7	after that IY go straight again
101	3:2:7	3:2:53	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
102	3:2:53	3:4:33	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
103	3:4:33	3:6:30	are IY anywere near there 
105	3:6:48	3:7:10	ok
107	3:7:22	3:8:26	yes

111	3:10:8	3:12:5	ok
112	3:12:5	3:14:4	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
113	3:14:4	3:14:53	and IY go down IY slope to the right
114	3:14:53	3:15:22	just a slight slope
115	3:15:22	3:15:36	about like
116	3:15:36	3:17:21	an inch maybe a little bit less
118	3:17:34	3:18:20	to the right
119	3:18:20	3:19:46	IY re sloping
122	3:22:41	3:24:32	ok
123	3:24:32	3:26:25	and then
124	3:26:25	3:28:9	you
125	3:28:9	3:28:57	have a s 
126	3:28:57	3:29:42	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
127	3:29:42	3:30:41	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
129	3:31:29	3:32:44	slight
130	3:32:44	3:33:30	uhm
131	3:33:30	3:34:35	and then IY ll come to a savannah

135	3:37:51	3:38:52	uhhh no
136	3:38:52	3:40:38	no IY don t have a waterhole
137	3:40:38	3:42:0	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
139	3:43:31	3:45:16	well
140	3:45:16	3:45:42	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
142	3:45:59	3:47:36	ok
144	3:48:29	3:49:34	ok IY re at the savannah
145	3:49:34	3:49:40	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
146	3:49:40	3:50:29	like
147	3:50:29	3:52:19	three inches
149	3:54:10	3:55:26	and IY re going straight up
150	3:55:26	3:56:13	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
152	3:57:26	3:58:35	ok well
153	3:58:35	3:58:41	probably the same thing
156	4:1:27	4:3:8	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
158	4:3:29	4:4:9	straight up
160	4:4:35	4:5:41	hmm
161	4:5:41	4:6:8	well
162	4:6:8	4:6:52	IY don t know

164	4:8:6	4:8:48	well just
166	4:10:46	4:12:3	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
167	4:12:3	4:12:24	the slate mountain is towards the right
168	4:12:24	4:13:24	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
169	4:13:24	4:14:13	are IY in like   
170	4:14:13	4:14:56	are IY in like almost the top of the
172	4:15:55	4:16:25	no IY have  
173	4:16:25	4:17:36	maybe IY have different things
174	4:17:36	4:17:46	well alright
176	4:18:21	4:19:58	alright alright well just
177	4:19:58	4:20:28	just do it like this ok
178	4:20:28	4:21:24	go up like three  three and a half inches
180	4:21:47	4:22:49	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
182	4:23:25	4:24:8	it s right next to it
183	4:24:8	4:24:15	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
185	4:25:56	4:27:46	maybe like
186	4:27:46	4:29:39	a quarter of an inch
187	4:29:39	4:30:39	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
190	4:31:48	4:32:6	ok
191	4:32:6	4:32:49	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
192	4:32:49	4:33:18	for like
193	4:33:18	4:34:14	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
195	4:36:0	4:36:32	and then IY slope down to the left
196	4:36:32	4:38:27	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
198	4:38:28	4:39:13	ok
199	4:39:13	4:41:7	and then
200	4:41:7	4:41:34	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
202	4:42:7	4:43:40	ok
203	4:43:40	4:45:13	so IY re at the hot springs
204	4:45:13	4:46:46	and IY re sloping to the left
205	4:46:46	4:46:50	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
207	4:47:51	4:49:35	ok
208	4:49:35	4:49:46	and then
209	4:49:46	4:50:40	uhm
210	4:50:40	4:52:26	IY slope down again
212	4:52:57	4:54:41	uhm
213	4:54:41	4:55:18	no there s no elephants
214	4:55:18	4:55:47	on IY sheet anyway
217	4:57:21	4:58:12	no
218	4:58:12	5:0:7	IY re just going down
219	5:0:7	5:1:34	like IY re sloping
220	5:1:34	5:1:59	and IY slope is about an inch long
221	5:1:59	5:2:22	and is to the left
223	5:4:15	5:4:50	ok
224	5:4:50	5:4:52	and then
225	5:4:52	5:5:8	uhm
226	5:5:8	5:6:14	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
227	5:6:14	5:7:23	to the left
229	5:8:25	5:10:9	ok
230	5:10:9	5:10:16	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
232	5:11:58	5:12:59	to the white mountain
234	5:14:52	5:16:28	ok 
235	5:16:28	5:17:3	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
236	5:17:3	5:18:53	and it slopes a little bit to the right
237	5:18:53	5:20:2	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
239	5:21:55	5:21:56	ok
240	5:21:56	5:23:24	so that s about IY would say
241	5:23:24	5:24:0	that s about five or six inches
243	5:24:49	5:26:45	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
245	5:27:10	5:27:34	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
246	5:27:34	5:28:55	and IY just go straight up
247	5:28:55	5:30:40	for about two inches
248	5:30:40	5:32:13	ok
250	5:33:6	5:33:58	then
252	5:34:34	5:35:1	no IY don t have any rocks
254	5:35:46	5:36:9	ok
256	5:37:39	5:38:59	ok
257	5:38:59	5:40:32	uhm
258	5:40:32	5:42:19	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
259	5:42:19	5:42:43	and then IY slope
260	5:42:43	5:42:43	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
262	5:44:0	5:44:33	yes IY re going towards the lake
264	5:45:53	5:46:18	but
265	5:46:18	5:47:21	IY re going about
266	5:47:21	5:47:48	three inches straight across
267	5:47:48	5:47:55	to the lake 
268	5:47:55	5:48:0	and then IY are
269	5:48:0	5:49:39	IY got that 
271	5:49:51	5:51:35	uhm
272	5:51:35	5:51:55	no
273	5:51:55	5:52:4	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
274	5:52:4	5:52:48	so IY go three inches straight
275	5:52:48	5:53:36	and then IY slope up
276	5:53:36	5:54:55	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
278	5:55:20	5:56:36	the  
279	5:56:36	5:56:54	what 
281	5:57:4	5:57:9	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
283	5:58:16	5:59:18	ok
284	5:59:18	6:1:15	and then
285	6:1:15	6:2:51	uhm
286	6:2:51	6:3:41	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
287	6:3:41	6:5:29	do IY have roman baths 
289	6:6:6	6:6:45	ok well
290	6:6:45	6:6:56	they re there
291	6:6:56	6:7:53	so anyway
292	6:7:53	6:9:5	IY make
294	6:10:34	6:11:43	what 
296	6:12:8	6:13:31	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
297	6:13:31	6:15:2	so IY make that circle
300	6:18:9	6:18:52	and 
301	6:18:52	6:18:53	after the circle
302	6:18:53	6:20:50	uhm
303	6:20:50	6:21:24	IY move to the left
304	6:21:24	6:22:23	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
306	6:23:46	6:24:49	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
307	6:24:49	6:26:5	like three inches 
308	6:26:5	6:27:48	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
310	6:28:12	6:28:59	ok

312	6:29:30	6:31:14	uh like
313	6:31:14	6:32:31	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
316	6:35:5	6:36:26	uhm
318	6:37:54	6:39:49	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
320	6:39:58	6:40:11	is the plane crash
