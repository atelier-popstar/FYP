0:1:3	0:1:10	g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
0:1:40	0:1:45	g	and then IY go straight
0:2:6	0:2:8	g	and then
0:2:26	0:2:26	f	ok
0:4:11	0:4:14	g	uhm

0:12:49	0:12:54	f	mm hmm
0:13:22	0:13:27	g	yes IY re going towards the lake
0:15:10	0:15:12	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
0:15:11	0:15:13	g	are IY in like   
0:16:13	0:16:22	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
0:16:29	0:16:34	g	ok
0:16:34	0:16:40	f	do IY go around it 
0:17:4	0:17:13	g	and then
0:18:43	0:18:48	g	and there s a plane crash
0:21:11	0:21:18	g	after that IY go straight again
0:22:11	0:22:16	g	a little bit too
0:25:23	0:25:25	f	ok
0:25:38	0:25:41	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
0:27:19	0:27:28	f	ok
0:32:41	0:32:42	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
0:33:21	0:33:22	g	like an inch
0:33:22	0:33:26	g	ok
0:33:31	0:33:35	g	for like
0:33:26	0:33:35	f	ok
0:33:38	0:33:47	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
0:33:59	0:34:5	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
0:35:38	0:35:39	g	ok well
0:37:30	0:37:34	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
0:37:38	0:37:45	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
0:37:49	0:37:49	f	mm hmm
0:38:55	0:38:56	g	have a s 
0:39:2	0:39:3	g	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
0:40:30	0:40:33	g	and IY should have a straight line there
0:40:38	0:40:40	f	IY go to a lake 
0:41:42	0:41:49	f	and to the right 
0:42:29	0:42:38	g	ok
0:42:50	0:42:57	g	do IY have roman baths 
0:44:6	0:44:10	g	ok
0:44:24	0:44:27	g	to the left
0:45:8	0:45:12	g	after IY slope down IY d say
0:48:43	0:48:50	g	what 
0:49:25	0:49:25	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
0:50:18	0:50:22	g	just a slight slope
0:51:15	0:51:21	g	and then
0:51:39	0:51:48	g	five
0:53:57	0:53:59	f	nope
0:54:7	0:54:10	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
0:54:5	0:54:13	f	around the lake to the top 
0:55:17	0:55:22	g	is the plane crash  
0:57:58	0:58:5	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
0:58:9	0:58:11	g	ok
0:58:16	0:58:22	f	ok
0:58:21	0:58:29	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
0:59:7	0:59:9	f	ok
1:0:10	1:0:17	g	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
1:1:48	1:1:56	g	ok IY re at the savannah
1:7:38	1:7:44	g	ok
1:8:10	1:8:15	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
1:11:11	1:11:18	f	oh
1:11:45	1:11:45	g	IY got that 
1:13:11	1:13:16	g	uhm
1:15:6	1:15:9	f	to the left of the antelope
1:16:25	1:16:32	g	IY just kind of slope down
1:17:14	1:17:21	g	a little
1:19:18	1:19:18	g	ok
1:20:19	1:20:26	f	yeah
1:20:36	1:20:41	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
1:20:58	1:20:58	g	so that s about IY would say
1:21:51	1:21:56	f	mm hmm
1:22:8	1:22:11	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
1:22:57	1:23:0	g	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
1:23:6	1:23:12	g	uhm
1:24:56	1:25:4	f	do IY go through anything 
1:26:34	1:26:39	g	IY go straight down
1:28:46	1:28:49	g	IY re kind of going  
1:29:2	1:29:9	g	that s about five or six inches

1:32:0	1:32:9	g	ok
1:35:5	1:35:6	g	to the right
1:38:2	1:38:2	f	yep
1:38:29	1:38:34	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
1:38:41	1:38:49	g	four or five inches to the left
1:41:40	1:41:43	f	ok
1:42:15	1:42:18	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
1:43:12	1:43:15	g	alright 
1:43:31	1:43:40	f	ok
1:44:58	1:45:1	f	ok
1:45:10	1:45:18	f	mm hmm
1:45:29	1:45:37	g	and IY just go straight up
1:46:1	1:46:5	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
1:47:19	1:47:22	g	like four or five inches to the left
1:48:14	1:48:15	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right
1:48:47	1:48:54	f	and curve down to the left 
1:48:47	1:48:56	g	ok
1:49:30	1:49:32	g	ok and then IY re going
1:51:19	1:51:23	f	uhm IY
1:52:55	1:52:57	g	there s a there s  
1:54:26	1:54:28	g	straight up
1:55:39	1:55:46	f	ok
1:59:58	1:59:59	g	uhm
2:1:51	2:1:53	g	uhm
2:1:46	2:1:55	g	to the left
2:3:6	2:3:10	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
2:4:50	2:4:50	g	so anyway
2:4:52	2:4:54	f	ok
2:5:52	2:6:0	g	and then IY slope up
2:6:51	2:6:54	g	three inches
2:8:24	2:8:31	g	IY plane crash 
2:9:1	2:9:1	g	three inches
2:9:11	2:9:11	g	like
2:9:28	2:9:36	g	after plane crash
2:10:17	2:10:20	g	it s not a big curve
2:10:42	2:10:51	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
2:12:34	2:12:34	g	to the lake 
2:12:58	2:13:6	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
2:13:12	2:13:12	g	maybe like
2:15:24	2:15:27	f	ok
2:15:57	2:16:6	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
2:17:30	2:17:35	f	yeah
2:24:21	2:24:29	g	and IY re going straight up
2:24:51	2:24:51	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
2:25:31	2:25:34	f	yeah
2:26:0	2:26:9	g	are IY  
2:26:22	2:26:24	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
2:27:32	2:27:39	f	so wait
2:29:9	2:29:15	g	ok
2:32:36	2:32:37	f	and
2:32:58	2:33:5	g	like IY re sloping
2:37:10	2:37:17	g	and that s where the plane crash is
2:37:28	2:37:35	g	kind of across from stony desert
2:41:23	2:41:23	g	it s right next to it
2:42:3	2:42:10	g	IY re sloping
2:42:46	2:42:52	f	and then what 
2:42:54	2:42:56	g	and IY re going up like
2:42:47	2:42:56	g	ok
2:44:18	2:44:20	g	well
2:44:48	2:44:57	g	not right at the stony desert
2:47:12	2:47:15	f	mm hmm
2:50:33	2:50:41	g	no IY have  
2:50:38	2:50:46	g	just do it like this ok
2:50:43	2:50:48	g	maybe IY have different things
2:58:15	2:58:22	f	yeah 
2:58:33	2:58:40	g	no IY don t have a waterhole
2:59:40	2:59:43	f	ok
3:0:9	3:0:17	g	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
3:0:15	3:0:18	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
3:1:53	3:2:0	g	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
3:2:21	3:2:23	g	so IY re at the hot springs
3:3:21	3:3:30	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
3:3:53	3:3:55	f	ok wait hold on
3:4:12	3:4:20	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
3:10:16	3:10:21	g	a quarter of an inch
3:11:33	3:11:34	g	an inch maybe a little bit less
3:14:3	3:14:9	g	and IY re sloping to the left
3:14:8	3:14:10	g	like
3:15:47	3:15:52	f	yeah IY see that
3:17:4	3:17:10	g	slight
3:20:47	3:20:51	g	uhm
3:21:14	3:21:23	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
3:23:47	3:23:51	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
3:24:10	3:24:17	g	no there s no elephants
3:25:13	3:25:14	f	yeah
3:25:44	3:25:46	f	IY m three inches above the savannah
3:26:31	3:26:34	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
3:27:40	3:27:47	g	like three inches 
3:29:6	3:29:12	g	ok
3:29:29	3:29:32	g	uhm
3:30:50	3:30:57	g	and then IY slope
3:32:52	3:33:1	g	IY make
3:36:18	3:36:18	g	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
3:36:28	3:36:30	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
3:40:23	3:40:26	f	to the left
3:40:47	3:40:47	f	ok
3:43:5	3:43:10	g	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
3:44:8	3:44:10	g	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
3:44:40	3:44:41	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
3:47:0	3:47:2	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
3:47:49	3:47:49	f	ok
3:49:45	3:49:48	f	IY hit some rocks though
3:51:50	3:51:50	g	probably the same thing
3:53:13	3:53:16	g	uhm
3:56:0	3:56:3	f	yeah 
3:56:31	3:56:31	g	are IY anywhere near there 
3:57:26	3:57:32	g	from
3:58:34	3:58:42	f	ok
3:58:35	3:58:44	g	and
3:59:33	3:59:35	g	ok well
4:0:32	4:0:33	g	and then
4:2:24	4:2:24	g	and 
4:6:26	4:6:31	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
4:6:57	4:7:0	f	IY ve a plane crash though
4:7:27	4:7:32	g	ok
4:9:58	4:9:58	g	and then IY go
4:12:58	4:12:59	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
4:13:29	4:13:38	f	ok
4:14:42	4:14:50	g	uhm
4:16:44	4:16:49	g	like
4:18:6	4:18:9	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
4:19:6	4:19:11	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
4:20:23	4:20:28	f	ok
4:20:29	4:20:30	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
4:22:7	4:22:16	g	like maybe an inch
4:22:42	4:22:45	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
4:22:59	4:23:7	g	IY re at the plane crash
4:23:50	4:23:51	f	ok
4:24:39	4:24:39	f	yeah
4:26:5	4:26:13	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
4:27:51	4:27:53	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
4:28:34	4:28:43	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
4:29:3	4:29:8	f	mm  mm
4:29:58	4:30:5	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
4:31:15	4:31:20	g	no
4:32:6	4:32:6	g	uhm
4:32:48	4:32:56	g	ok
4:35:9	4:35:14	g	they re there
4:36:43	4:36:47	g	are IY anywere near there 
4:37:18	4:37:26	g	and then
4:38:51	4:38:51	g	ok
4:40:21	4:40:30	g	for about two inches
4:41:11	4:41:19	g	for like
4:41:38	4:41:38	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
4:41:34	4:41:43	g	alright 
4:42:52	4:42:54	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
4:44:48	4:44:56	g	and IY re going
4:45:35	4:45:38	f	to the right 
4:45:58	4:46:5	g	IY re starting
4:46:33	4:46:33	g	uhm
4:47:14	4:47:17	f	IY have to back up a little bit
4:47:15	4:47:23	f	ok
4:49:18	4:49:23	g	around the bottom of it
4:49:20	4:49:23	g	ok
4:51:18	4:51:18	g	and then
4:52:13	4:52:14	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
4:54:35	4:54:38	g	IY slope down again
4:54:33	4:54:39	g	to the white mountain
4:55:5	4:55:5	g	hmm
4:56:15	4:56:24	g	but
4:56:41	4:56:49	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
4:57:20	4:57:22	g	IY re starting at the stony desert
4:59:25	4:59:30	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
5:0:21	5:0:23	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
5:2:46	5:2:49	g	and is to the left
5:3:46	5:3:46	g	maybe four inches on the paper
5:4:43	5:4:51	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
5:4:46	5:4:54	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
5:6:43	5:6:47	f	ok
5:8:17	5:8:25	g	then
5:9:23	5:9:29	g	IY would say
5:9:56	5:10:2	g	to IY right 
5:11:53	5:11:57	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
5:12:56	5:13:3	f	yeah and IY went straight up
5:14:7	5:14:9	g	three inches straight across
5:15:6	5:15:15	f	ok
5:15:41	5:15:48	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
5:15:42	5:15:49	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
5:16:15	5:16:22	f	uh IY don t know know what to say
5:16:19	5:16:24	f	ok
5:19:26	5:19:26	g	and
5:22:14	5:22:18	f	nope IY have a white mountain
5:23:46	5:23:49	g	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
5:24:18	5:24:18	f	IY hit some round rocks
5:24:40	5:24:48	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
5:24:54	5:24:54	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
5:26:51	5:26:52	g	well
5:27:24	5:27:33	g	and then IY re going down
5:28:44	5:28:51	f	ok
5:29:32	5:29:41	g	and then IY slope down to the left
5:32:25	5:32:32	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
5:35:4	5:35:13	g	IY re just going down
5:35:21	5:35:22	f	ok
5:37:47	5:37:50	f	how many inches do IY think 
5:38:45	5:38:48	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
5:38:58	5:39:3	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
5:39:48	5:39:53	g	IY wanna kind of curve
5:40:46	5:40:49	f	elephants 
5:41:2	5:41:3	g	ok 
5:42:57	5:43:0	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
5:45:39	5:45:44	g	no IY don t have any rocks
5:45:45	5:45:53	g	you
5:53:0	5:53:6	g	ok
5:54:29	5:54:30	g	so IY go three inches straight
5:55:34	5:55:36	g	like
6:0:54	6:1:2	g	well just
6:2:22	6:2:24	g	on IY sheet anyway
6:2:38	6:2:41	g	uhm
6:2:41	6:2:49	g	alright alright well just
6:2:42	6:2:51	g	and then

6:4:28	6:4:35	g	so
6:5:42	6:5:45	g	IY re going about
6:5:53	6:5:53	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
6:8:49	6:8:58	f	around the top of the lake 
6:9:29	6:9:36	g	ok
6:10:16	6:10:18	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
6:10:26	6:10:35	g	well alright
6:11:1	6:11:5	g	uhm
6:11:23	6:11:32	g	yes

6:12:23	6:12:25	f	up tp the right
6:16:2	6:16:5	g	after the circle
6:18:5	6:18:5	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
6:19:25	6:19:33	f	IY know IY have different things so
