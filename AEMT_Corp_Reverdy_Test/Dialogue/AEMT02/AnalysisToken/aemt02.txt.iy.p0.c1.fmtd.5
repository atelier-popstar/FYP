0:54:44	0:54:45	g	268	3285			and curve to  not down just curve to the left
0:57:11	0:57:16	g	136	3436			yes
0:58:39	0:58:46	g	29	3526			around the bottom of it
1:0:3	1:0:5	g	285	3605			and there s a plane crash
1:0:17	1:0:20	g	74	3620			ok
1:0:36	1:0:42	f	177	3642			ok
1:1:58	1:2:5	g	234	3725			no IY don t have any rocks

1:6:52	1:7:0	g	195	4020			maybe
1:8:49	1:8:52	f	331	4132			IY m three inches above the savannah
1:9:13	1:9:18	g	280	4158			uhm
1:11:3	1:11:8	g	173	4268			after that IY go straight again
1:11:21	1:11:26	g	135	4286			and IY re going straight up
1:13:0	1:13:6	f	80	4386			am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
1:12:57	1:13:6	f	36	4386			do IY go around it

1:15:49	1:15:50	g	70	4550			and then IY are
1:16:26	1:16:31	g	115	4591			IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
1:18:6	1:18:8	g	25	4688			no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
1:19:14	1:19:18	g	66	4758			and then
1:19:24	1:19:31	g	306	4771			that s IY little slope
1:20:16	1:20:16	f	336	4816			up diagonally to the right of the antelope
1:20:48	1:20:49	g	18	4849			it s right next to it
1:21:10	1:21:18	g	312	4878			IY re just going down
1:24:5	1:24:14	g	221	5054			and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
1:25:5	1:25:14	g	71	5114			to IY right 
1:26:54	1:27:0	f	194	5220			to 
1:27:1	1:27:9	g	225	5229			ok
1:27:58	1:28:1	f	215	5281			mm  mm
1:28:19	1:28:19	f	269	5299			ok
1:30:48	1:30:50	g	100	5450			IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
1:31:38	1:31:43	g	43	5503			IY re actually starting like right
1:33:8	1:33:13	g	110	5593			and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
1:34:34	1:34:42	f	82	5682			so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
1:35:53	1:36:0	g	76	5760			ok
1:41:9	1:41:15	f	50	6075			and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
1:44:51	1:44:55	g	166	6295			uhm
1:44:57	1:45:4	g	198	6304			is the plane crash  
1:48:6	1:48:14	g	196	6494			uhm
1:49:8	1:49:9	f	233	6549			ok
1:49:8	1:49:15	g	243	6555			and that s where the plane crash is
1:50:1	1:50:5	g	132	6605			and
1:50:19	1:50:24	g	289	6624			IY got that 
1:50:29	1:50:36	g	296	6636			IY re going like
1:52:35	1:52:40	g	168	6760			so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
1:53:58	1:54:4	g	99	6844			and it slopes a little bit to the right
1:54:19	1:54:21	g	106	6861			well just
1:54:22	1:54:27	f	46	6867			IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
1:56:30	1:56:30	g	251	6990			ok
2:0:1	2:0:2	g	108	7202			uhm
2:0:59	2:1:1	g	179	7261			probably the same thing
2:3:20	2:3:29	g	152	7409			then
2:4:2	2:4:5	g	38	7445			so IY go three inches straight
2:5:10	2:5:14	g	41	7514			uhm
2:5:27	2:5:31	f	320	7531			yeah IY see that
2:7:2	2:7:5	g	180	7625			ok
2:8:0	2:8:2	g	249	7682			and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
2:8:27	2:8:31	g	4	7711			ok
2:8:37	2:8:40	f	157	7720			and curve down to the left 
2:8:49	2:8:49	g	274	7729			and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
2:9:34	2:9:39	g	54	7779			like
2:10:50	2:10:50	g	96	7850			what 
2:11:0	2:11:9	g	159	7869			like maybe an inch
2:11:43	2:11:49	g	287	7909			and IY should have a straight line there
2:12:10	2:12:16	g	213	7936			ok
2:16:34	2:16:43	g	294	8203			ok

2:17:2	2:17:5	g	139	8225			straight up
2:17:30	2:17:37	f	185	8257			up tp the right
2:19:22	2:19:28	f	263	8368			it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
2:24:10	2:24:10	g	79	8650			there s a there s  
2:24:28	2:24:34	f	5	8674			so wait
2:26:31	2:26:37	g	140	8797			after IY slope down IY d say
2:29:20	2:29:26	g	335	8966			it s not a big curve
2:29:43	2:29:50	f	52	8990			and to the right 
2:33:7	2:33:7	g	174	9187			alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
2:33:11	2:33:19	g	2	9199			uhm
2:33:34	2:33:35	g	314	9215			and 
2:34:26	2:34:26	g	261	9266			as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
2:35:58	2:36:4	f	63	9364			ok
2:38:45	2:38:46	g	219	9526			and then
2:40:2	2:40:4	g	87	9604			and then IY go straight
2:40:43	2:40:45	g	202	9645			IY wanna kind of curve
2:41:42	2:41:49	g	226	9709			uhm
2:42:4	2:42:4	g	230	9724			to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
2:44:23	2:44:27	g	149	9867			and then IY  IY go up
2:45:7	2:45:15	g	227	9915			uhm
2:45:21	2:45:22	g	205	9922			and IY go down IY slope to the right
2:45:40	2:45:41	f	158	9941			ok
2:45:42	2:45:44	g	1	9944			are IY anywhere near there

2:52:9	2:52:16	f	34	10336			IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
2:52:36	2:52:38	g	247	10358			well
2:53:19	2:53:23	g	291	10403			it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
2:54:48	2:54:52	g	51	10492			IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
3:0:7	3:0:7	g	93	10807			uhm
3:0:18	3:0:19	f	77	10819			IY have to back up a little bit

3:9:42	3:9:43	g	235	11383			where IY re going down to a plane crash
3:12:20	3:12:25	g	299	11545			ok
3:13:16	3:13:18	g	40	11598			and then IY slope up

3:21:13	3:21:14	g	216	12074			kind of across from stony desert
3:22:0	3:22:1	g	260	12121			like three inches 
3:23:46	3:23:46	g	94	12226			and IY re going
3:24:14	3:24:17	f	275	12257			IY know IY have different things so

3:25:13	3:25:20	g	313	12320			ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
3:26:38	3:26:44	g	145	12404			IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
3:27:34	3:27:36	g	156	12456			IY re starting
3:28:4	3:28:5	f	193	12485			am IY supposed to start at the same place 
3:27:59	3:28:6	g	129	12486			IY have a waterhole on IY map 
3:29:2	3:29:11	g	68	12551			ok
3:29:25	3:29:30	f	56	12570			mm hmm

3:30:32	3:30:37	f	242	12637			ok
3:35:33	3:35:33	g	330	12933			now IY re at the collapsed shelter
3:36:34	3:36:37	g	64	12997			yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
3:38:9	3:38:11	f	138	13091			IY hit some rocks though
3:41:23	3:41:24	g	102	13284			ok IY re at the savannah
3:41:28	3:41:33	g	120	13293			alright 
3:41:37	3:41:37	g	62	13297			from
3:42:43	3:42:43	g	220	13363			ok
3:43:17	3:43:24	g	167	13404			to the white mountain
3:43:38	3:43:38	f	332	13418			yeah
3:43:54	3:43:58	g	318	13438			so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
3:44:8	3:44:8	g	111	13448			in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
3:44:17	3:44:20	g	207	13460			slight
3:44:17	3:44:22	g	59	13462			ok
3:46:5	3:46:8	g	266	13568			to the left
3:46:10	3:46:11	f	236	13571			around the lake to the top 
3:46:41	3:46:49	f	322	13609			uhm IY
3:47:1	3:47:9	f	113	13629			IY ve a plane crash though
3:49:51	3:49:52	g	55	13792			like
3:50:16	3:50:20	g	307	13820			for about two inches
3:51:21	3:51:27	f	0	13887			nope IY have a white mountain
3:56:31	3:56:36	g	248	14196			ok
3:58:35	3:58:43	g	315	14323			uhm
3:59:10	3:59:16	g	155	14356			where are IY right now   start at the savannah
4:0:8	4:0:14	f	28	14414			yeah and IY went straight up
4:0:35	4:0:37	g	197	14437			uh like
4:1:19	4:1:25	f	253	14485			so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
4:2:17	4:2:20	g	228	14540			four or five inches to the left
4:3:30	4:3:36	g	103	14616			the slate mountain is towards the right
4:5:6	4:5:9	g	7	14709			and then IY ll come to a savannah
4:8:4	4:8:8	g	67	14888			after the circle
4:10:4	4:10:6	g	57	15006			like four or five inches to the left
4:10:13	4:10:19	g	206	15019			no
4:10:42	4:10:50	g	171	15050			a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
4:11:23	4:11:26	g	273	15086			three inches
4:12:40	4:12:47	g	60	15167			uhm
4:12:45	4:12:53	g	286	15173			to the right
4:14:17	4:14:19	g	85	15259			and then IY slope
4:14:41	4:14:50	f	21	15290			no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
4:15:18	4:15:27	g	231	15327			so IY re at the hot springs
4:16:21	4:16:26	g	190	15386			yes IY re going towards the lake
4:16:45	4:16:47	g	27	15407			maybe IY have different things
4:16:52	4:17:0	g	17	15420			ok
4:17:51	4:17:58	g	12	15478			so that s about IY would say
4:18:35	4:18:39	f	302	15519			but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
4:20:28	4:20:33	f	301	15633			so IY pass a waterhole or no 
4:21:17	4:21:17	g	328	15677			like
4:22:7	4:22:8	f	121	15728			and there s a collapsed shelter
4:25:4	4:25:9	g	130	15909			three inches straight across
4:29:4	4:29:10	g	300	16150			and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
4:30:37	4:30:39	g	183	16239			yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
4:30:33	4:30:40	f	262	16240			yeah 
4:31:14	4:31:15	g	187	16275			uhhh no
4:32:8	4:32:11	g	175	16331			well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
4:32:32	4:32:38	g	176	16358			alright 
4:33:57	4:33:59	f	160	16439			oh
4:35:51	4:35:52	g	15	16552			uhm
4:38:51	4:39:0	g	73	16740			the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
4:39:41	4:39:47	g	83	16787			and then
4:39:59	4:40:8	g	341	16808			to the lake

4:52:46	4:52:51	g	119	17571			IY re sloping
4:54:19	4:54:27	g	165	17667			and IY slope is about an inch long
4:54:52	4:54:57	g	290	17697			now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
4:55:42	4:55:50	g	201	17750			so IY make that circle
4:56:2	4:56:9	g	239	17769			and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
4:56:18	4:56:18	g	137	17778			ok
4:56:47	4:56:51	f	89	17811			ok

4:59:39	4:59:40	g	209	17980			and IY re sloping to the left
5:0:7	5:0:13	g	3	18013			are IY anywere near there 
5:2:11	5:2:19	g	125	18139			and 
5:6:3	5:6:12	f	42	18372			yeah 
5:6:25	5:6:34	g	164	18394			IY plane crash 
5:6:55	5:7:1	g	144	18421			IY would say
5:7:14	5:7:23	f	271	18443			ok
5:9:56	5:10:1	f	229	18601			IY hit some round rocks
5:9:54	5:10:2	g	337	18602			maybe four inches on the paper
5:10:53	5:10:53	f	338	18653			ok
5:11:36	5:11:39	g	8	18699			and then

5:17:51	5:17:56	f	246	19076			ok
5:23:19	5:23:22	g	33	19402			and then right around the antelope IY take a right
5:23:58	5:24:2	f	192	19442			do IY hit anything when IY go down 
5:24:29	5:24:37	f	309	19477			IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
5:26:16	5:26:24	g	252	19584			so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
5:27:26	5:27:34	g	342	19654			just do it like this ok
5:28:50	5:28:52	f	101	19732			ok

5:42:12	5:42:13	g	142	20533			IY just kind of slope down
5:43:4	5:43:6	g	30	20586			right next to IY circle should be roman baths
5:47:42	5:47:48	f	84	20868			ok
5:48:32	5:48:41	g	279	20921			uhm

5:53:37	5:53:46	g	293	21226			and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
5:53:50	5:53:55	f	232	21235			so IY go to the left of the antelope
5:54:20	5:54:27	g	264	21267			and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
5:54:37	5:54:39	f	327	21279			 IY m at the savannah
5:59:45	5:59:49	g	112	21589			oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
6:3:37	6:3:43	f	292	21823			to the left of the antelope
6:4:36	6:4:38	f	339	21878			ok
6:4:56	6:5:3	g	134	21903			couple miles or something
6:5:24	6:5:33	f	258	21933			IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
6:5:53	6:5:57	g	154	21957			and IY re going up like
6:5:55	6:6:2	f	169	21962			do IY go by the plane crash 
6:6:52	6:6:52	f	319	22012			around the top of the lake 
6:7:13	6:7:19	g	61	22039			no
6:7:37	6:7:41	g	188	22061			just a slight slope
6:11:5	6:11:6	g	257	22266			ok
6:11:5	6:11:8	f	184	22268			how many inches do IY think 
6:11:56	6:11:59	g	9	22319			IY re at the plane crash
6:12:24	6:12:31	g	295	22351			ok
6:12:51	6:12:52	g	211	22372			and then
6:13:3	6:13:3	g	186	22383			to the left
6:14:58	6:15:3	g	88	22503			and is to the left
6:15:9	6:15:10	g	133	22510			about like
6:16:35	6:16:37	g	241	22597			on IY sheet anyway

6:22:40	6:22:42	g	75	22962			do IY have roman baths 
6:27:33	6:27:34	g	35	23254			go up like three  three and a half inches
6:29:28	6:29:31	g	72	23371			are IY in like almost the top of the
6:29:36	6:29:43	g	214	23383			are IY  
6:32:53	6:33:2	g	20	23582			ok well
6:33:44	6:33:46	g	316	23626			an inch maybe a little bit less
6:33:45	6:33:51	g	224	23631			maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
6:33:56	6:34:5	g	11	23645			like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
6:34:41	6:34:45	g	333	23685			and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
6:35:34	6:35:41	g	31	23741			IY move to the left
6:36:0	6:36:5	g	14	23765			uhm

6:37:59	6:37:59	f	32	23879			to the right 
6:38:22	6:38:23	g	81	23903			and IY just go straight up
6:38:44	6:38:47	g	118	23927			no there s no elephants
6:41:10	6:41:13	g	107	24073			three inches
