start
0:1:17	0:1:19	g	and then
0:3:30	0:3:30	g	what 
0:3:31	0:3:35	g	ok
0:3:54	0:3:57	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
0:4:9	0:4:10	f	mm hmm
0:5:15	0:5:17	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
0:6:18	0:6:22	g	the  
0:7:37	0:7:39	g	ok
0:8:15	0:8:23	g	IY re just going down
0:9:25	0:9:26	f	 IY m at the savannah
0:13:13	0:13:14	g	ok
0:13:40	0:13:42	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
0:13:47	0:13:55	f	ok
0:14:54	0:14:58	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
0:15:15	0:15:19	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
0:16:16	0:16:18	f	around the top of the lake 
0:16:56	0:17:4	f	to 
0:17:2	0:17:5	g	uhm
0:18:37	0:18:37	g	IY re going about
0:19:6	0:19:8	g	no IY have  
0:20:42	0:20:44	g	ok
0:20:53	0:20:59	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
0:23:35	0:23:36	g	you
0:24:56	0:24:59	g	and then
0:25:46	0:25:55	g	maybe like
0:26:42	0:26:42	f	yeah IY see that
0:26:41	0:26:44	g	and then IY slope up
0:26:54	0:27:0	f	yeah
0:27:56	0:27:59	f	ok
0:29:41	0:29:44	g	and 
0:30:58	0:30:59	g	are IY anywhere near there 
0:31:22	0:31:27	g	and then IY slope
0:31:34	0:31:40	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
0:32:10	0:32:19	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
0:32:34	0:32:35	g	maybe like
0:32:37	0:32:42	f	ok
0:32:36	0:32:42	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
0:32:45	0:32:48	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
0:35:8	0:35:16	f	how many inches do IY think 
0:35:46	0:35:50	g	uhm
0:36:14	0:36:14	f	so wait
0:37:15	0:37:20	g	ok well
0:39:43	0:39:51	g	and IY go to the left a little bit
0:39:59	0:40:3	g	IY re starting
0:44:27	0:44:29	g	ok 
0:44:54	0:45:3	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
0:45:58	0:45:58	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
0:46:5	0:46:14	g	no IY don t have a waterhole
0:50:22	0:50:23	f	ok
0:52:36	0:52:41	g	uhm
0:55:35	0:55:39	g	an inch maybe a little bit less
0:59:31	0:59:37	g	and then IY re going down
1:0:6	1:0:15	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
1:0:38	1:0:40	g	for about two inches
1:1:41	1:1:47	g	yes
1:2:4	1:2:8	g	is the plane crash  
1:3:17	1:3:19	g	ok
1:4:10	1:4:12	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
1:5:36	1:5:45	f	oh
1:6:15	1:6:19	g	and then
1:7:36	1:7:36	g	ok
1:8:10	1:8:16	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
1:10:8	1:10:16	g	ok
1:10:56	1:10:58	g	ok
1:11:31	1:11:34	g	a little bit too
1:12:12	1:12:20	f	ok
1:12:56	1:13:0	f	mm hmm
1:16:5	1:16:9	g	no
1:17:47	1:17:53	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
1:17:45	1:17:53	f	IY know IY have different things so
1:19:2	1:19:4	g	are IY anywere near there 
1:20:35	1:20:43	f	uh IY don t know know what to say
1:21:0	1:21:9	g	uhhh no
1:21:13	1:21:15	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
1:22:1	1:22:2	g	to the left
1:23:38	1:23:42	g	IY plane crash 
1:25:44	1:25:52	g	and then IY slope down to the left
1:28:19	1:28:23	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
1:30:33	1:30:33	g	just do it like this ok
1:31:11	1:31:12	f	elephants 
1:31:33	1:31:40	g	uhm
1:33:33	1:33:33	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
1:33:46	1:33:46	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
1:36:27	1:36:34	g	and then IY go
1:37:31	1:37:36	f	ok
1:40:21	1:40:28	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
1:41:53	1:42:1	g	three inches
1:42:54	1:42:57	g	yes IY re going towards the lake
1:46:48	1:46:52	g	IY would say
1:46:54	1:46:59	f	do IY go around it 
1:48:44	1:48:44	f	ok
1:51:24	1:51:33	g	and then
1:52:50	1:52:53	g	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
1:53:14	1:53:17	g	uhm
1:53:46	1:53:47	f	IY hit some rocks though
1:53:46	1:53:52	g	uhm
1:54:29	1:54:29	g	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
1:54:24	1:54:31	f	and then what 
1:54:38	1:54:38	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
1:55:14	1:55:21	g	have a s 
1:55:29	1:55:38	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
1:56:7	1:56:13	g	like three inches 
1:56:28	1:56:33	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
1:57:16	1:57:20	g	like
1:58:53	1:58:58	g	like
1:59:12	1:59:12	g	ok
1:59:8	1:59:16	g	so that s about IY would say
2:2:18	2:2:18	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
2:4:35	2:4:42	g	to IY right 
2:7:3	2:7:6	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
2:7:9	2:7:16	f	ok
2:8:36	2:8:37	f	ok
2:12:38	2:12:42	f	ok
2:13:2	2:13:11	f	to the right 
2:14:39	2:14:43	g	ok
2:14:54	2:14:59	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
2:15:46	2:15:50	g	and then IY go straight
2:19:19	2:19:24	f	ok
2:20:36	2:20:37	g	there s a there s  
2:22:28	2:22:28	g	are IY in like   
2:23:10	2:23:10	f	ok
2:25:29	2:25:31	g	ok
2:28:32	2:28:32	f	ok
2:28:36	2:28:43	g	a little
2:28:50	2:28:55	g	around the bottom of it
2:29:7	2:29:15	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
2:31:30	2:31:32	g	like maybe an inch
2:34:4	2:34:4	g	and there s a plane crash
2:35:26	2:35:35	g	IY go straight down
2:36:19	2:36:19	g	IY re kind of going  
2:37:41	2:37:46	g	ok
2:39:5	2:39:14	g	well
2:44:15	2:44:23	g	IY just kind of slope down
2:45:51	2:45:58	g	after that IY go straight again
2:51:38	2:51:38	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
2:53:35	2:53:42	g	like
2:54:2	2:54:11	g	maybe IY have different things
2:54:38	2:54:40	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
2:58:50	2:58:54	g	and then
2:59:22	2:59:30	g	it s right next to it
3:0:4	3:0:10	g	uhm
3:0:9	3:0:17	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
3:1:35	3:1:41	g	well alright
3:1:42	3:1:47	g	yes
3:1:50	3:1:57	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
3:2:14	3:2:23	g	and IY should have a straight line there
3:4:32	3:4:32	f	ok
3:4:58	3:5:6	g	uhm
3:7:46	3:7:46	f	IY m three inches above the savannah
3:8:24	3:8:33	g	and 
3:11:1	3:11:4	g	that s IY little slope
3:13:23	3:13:26	f	mm hmm
3:14:7	3:14:10	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
3:16:36	3:16:39	g	and then
3:17:44	3:17:49	g	IY re going like
3:17:50	3:17:59	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
3:19:25	3:19:26	g	ok
3:22:15	3:22:22	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
3:24:30	3:24:31	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
3:26:40	3:26:49	f	ok
3:26:50	3:26:57	g	uhm
3:27:22	3:27:30	g	IY got that 
3:28:31	3:28:36	f	yeah and IY went straight up
3:29:21	3:29:23	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
3:29:23	3:29:32	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
3:30:0	3:30:0	g	ok
3:31:2	3:31:9	g	and that s where the plane crash is
3:31:45	3:31:45	g	and IY just go straight up
3:31:49	3:31:56	g	are IY  
3:33:55	3:33:59	g	couple miles or something
3:35:7	3:35:16	g	IY re sloping
3:35:52	3:36:0	g	uh like
3:36:5	3:36:5	g	IY re at the plane crash
3:35:59	3:36:6	f	ok
3:36:17	3:36:19	f	IY have to back up a little bit
3:39:0	3:39:9	g	like an inch
3:39:6	3:39:14	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
3:40:29	3:40:30	g	for like
3:41:7	3:41:15	g	they re there
3:42:33	3:42:42	g	like four or five inches to the left
3:43:23	3:43:29	g	IY don t know
3:43:44	3:43:46	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
3:45:26	3:45:27	g	maybe
3:45:45	3:45:50	f	and curve down to the left 
3:46:5	3:46:6	g	alright 
3:46:33	3:46:35	g	ok
3:49:37	3:49:44	g	four or five inches to the left
3:51:32	3:51:33	g	kind of across from stony desert
3:53:53	3:53:53	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
3:55:33	3:55:37	g	ok
3:56:47	3:56:55	f	IY ve a plane crash though
3:57:14	3:57:22	g	three inches straight across
3:58:12	3:58:18	g	ok
3:58:54	3:58:59	f	ok
3:59:56	4:0:4	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
4:0:4	4:0:12	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
4:0:20	4:0:21	f	yeah
4:0:46	4:0:54	g	ok
4:3:54	4:4:1	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
4:4:42	4:4:43	g	ok
4:9:8	4:9:9	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
4:10:14	4:10:19	g	and then IY are
4:10:41	4:10:43	g	and then
4:10:55	4:10:56	g	after IY slope down IY d say
4:11:5	4:11:10	g	so IY make that circle
4:11:49	4:11:55	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
4:12:44	4:12:51	f	to the left
4:14:46	4:14:53	g	and IY re going up like
4:15:16	4:15:22	g	so anyway
4:15:30	4:15:30	f	nope
4:17:9	4:17:9	g	about like
4:17:23	4:17:32	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
4:18:36	4:18:43	g	maybe four inches on the paper
4:19:38	4:19:41	g	IY make
4:22:42	4:22:50	g	and IY re sloping to the left
4:23:49	4:23:53	f	yeah 
4:24:19	4:24:25	f	uhm IY
4:24:47	4:24:52	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
4:27:34	4:27:38	g	probably the same thing
4:29:1	4:29:8	g	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
4:29:32	4:29:36	g	ok IY re at the savannah
4:30:49	4:30:54	g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
4:31:14	4:31:14	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
4:34:40	4:34:47	g	alright 
4:35:6	4:35:12	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
4:35:21	4:35:27	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
4:35:42	4:35:51	f	IY hit some round rocks
4:36:46	4:36:50	g	uhm
4:41:9	4:41:14	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
4:42:49	4:42:53	f	ok
4:43:40	4:43:46	g	IY re starting at the stony desert
4:44:15	4:44:17	g	what 
4:45:44	4:45:47	g	it s not a big curve
4:45:53	4:46:1	g	five
4:47:14	4:47:22	g	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
4:47:30	4:47:34	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
4:48:8	4:48:14	g	uhm
4:49:44	4:49:48	g	so
4:49:48	4:49:48	f	ok
4:52:42	4:52:47	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
4:54:58	4:55:1	g	ok
4:55:19	4:55:27	g	then
4:56:1	4:56:2	g	to the white mountain
4:56:39	4:56:48	g	and IY re going straight up
4:58:43	4:58:51	f	yep
4:59:22	4:59:23	g	IY slope down again
5:1:59	5:2:8	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
5:2:8	5:2:12	g	on IY sheet anyway
5:2:45	5:2:47	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
5:4:23	5:4:25	f	ok
5:8:15	5:8:23	f	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
5:10:36	5:10:39	g	so IY go three inches straight
5:10:37	5:10:44	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
5:12:39	5:12:43	g	three inches
5:13:1	5:13:3	g	well
5:14:11	5:14:15	f	and
5:14:33	5:14:39	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
5:17:23	5:17:23	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
5:18:35	5:18:44	f	ok
5:20:28	5:20:35	g	uhm
5:27:31	5:27:37	f	ok wait hold on

5:31:13	5:31:20	g	do IY have roman baths 
5:32:37	5:32:43	f	around the lake to the top 
5:34:25	5:34:26	g	ok and then IY re going
5:34:48	5:34:49	g	from
5:34:56	5:35:2	g	IY wanna kind of curve
5:36:43	5:36:44	g	uhm
5:38:3	5:38:5	g	ok
5:38:6	5:38:11	g	and
5:38:5	5:38:11	f	yeah 
5:39:42	5:39:50	f	ok
5:39:47	5:39:53	g	but
5:40:26	5:40:33	g	to the right
5:42:32	5:42:36	g	and is to the left
5:42:35	5:42:36	f	mm hmm
5:43:54	5:43:56	g	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
5:44:34	5:44:42	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
5:45:54	5:46:1	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
5:47:58	5:48:3	g	ok
5:51:47	5:51:54	f	up tp the right
5:55:1	5:55:3	g	to the left
5:56:38	5:56:45	g	no IY don t have any rocks
5:57:28	5:57:33	g	a quarter of an inch
5:59:3	5:59:9	g	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
6:0:39	6:0:40	f	ok
6:2:1	6:2:9	f	nope IY have a white mountain
6:3:10	6:3:16	g	slight
6:3:57	6:4:2	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
6:4:9	6:4:14	g	to the left
6:5:54	6:5:55	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
6:8:33	6:8:41	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
6:8:56	6:9:5	g	not right at the stony desert
6:9:56	6:10:4	g	and then
6:10:37	6:10:45	g	well just
6:10:47	6:10:53	g	uhm
6:12:2	6:12:6	g	IY move to the left
6:12:49	6:12:58	g	and IY re going
6:14:55	6:14:55	g	uhm
6:15:5	6:15:14	g	for like
6:17:11	6:17:16	g	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
6:17:59	6:18:2	f	IY go to a lake 
6:18:30	6:18:38	g	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
6:21:35	6:21:43	g	after the circle
6:22:24	6:22:33	g	like IY re sloping
6:23:27	6:23:32	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter
