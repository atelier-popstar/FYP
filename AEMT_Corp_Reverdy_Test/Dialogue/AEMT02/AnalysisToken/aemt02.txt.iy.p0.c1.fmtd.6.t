start
start g
2	0:6:40	0:6:48	ok IY plane crash isn t there
3	0:6:50	0:6:53	a quarter of an inch
4	0:8:19	0:8:24	no IY don t have a waterhole
5	0:12:39	0:12:39	are IY in like   
6	0:12:51	0:12:55	like IY re sloping
8	0:15:2	0:15:5	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
9	0:16:5	0:16:12	and then
11	0:18:13	0:18:20	uhm
12	0:19:9	0:19:15	not right at the stony desert
14	0:21:21	0:21:28	like an inch
17	0:28:43	0:28:44	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
18	0:28:49	0:28:55	a little bit too
20	0:30:10	0:30:10	so anyway
21	0:31:9	0:31:12	ok
22	0:31:7	0:31:16	IY go straight down
23	0:31:59	0:32:3	five
25	0:36:3	0:36:9	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
28	0:38:39	0:38:43	so
29	0:39:33	0:39:34	alright are IY starting  near the  
30	0:39:57	0:40:4	and IY go to the left a little bit
33	0:44:10	0:44:13	uhm and there is a stony desert
34	0:45:42	0:45:48	and then IY slope down to the left
35	0:48:6	0:48:9	well alright
36	0:50:38	0:50:44	and then
38	0:53:39	0:53:41	no IY have  
39	0:54:44	0:54:45	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
40	0:57:11	0:57:16	yes
41	0:58:39	0:58:46	around the bottom of it
42	1:0:3	1:0:5	and there s a plane crash
43	1:0:17	1:0:20	ok
45	1:1:58	1:2:5	no IY don t have any rocks
46	1:4:16	1:4:19	yes
47	1:4:42	1:4:43	ok and then IY re going
48	1:6:52	1:7:0	maybe
50	1:9:13	1:9:18	uhm
51	1:11:3	1:11:8	after that IY go straight again
52	1:11:21	1:11:26	and IY re going straight up
56	1:13:44	1:13:47	IY make
58	1:14:49	1:14:55	uhm
59	1:15:49	1:15:50	and then IY are
60	1:16:26	1:16:31	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
61	1:18:6	1:18:8	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
62	1:19:14	1:19:18	and then
63	1:19:24	1:19:31	that s IY little slope
65	1:20:48	1:20:49	it s right next to it
66	1:21:10	1:21:18	IY re just going down
67	1:24:5	1:24:14	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
68	1:25:5	1:25:14	to IY right 
70	1:27:1	1:27:9	ok
73	1:30:48	1:30:50	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
74	1:31:38	1:31:43	IY re actually starting like right
75	1:33:8	1:33:13	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
77	1:35:53	1:36:0	ok
79	1:44:51	1:44:55	uhm
80	1:44:57	1:45:4	is the plane crash  
81	1:48:6	1:48:14	uhm
83	1:49:8	1:49:15	and that s where the plane crash is
84	1:50:1	1:50:5	and
85	1:50:19	1:50:24	IY got that 
86	1:50:29	1:50:36	IY re going like
87	1:52:35	1:52:40	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
88	1:53:58	1:54:4	and it slopes a little bit to the right
89	1:54:19	1:54:21	well just
91	1:56:30	1:56:30	ok
92	2:0:1	2:0:2	uhm
93	2:0:59	2:1:1	probably the same thing
94	2:3:20	2:3:29	then
95	2:4:2	2:4:5	so IY go three inches straight
96	2:5:10	2:5:14	uhm
98	2:7:2	2:7:5	ok
99	2:8:0	2:8:2	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
100	2:8:27	2:8:31	ok
102	2:8:49	2:8:49	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
103	2:9:34	2:9:39	like
104	2:10:50	2:10:50	what 
105	2:11:0	2:11:9	like maybe an inch
106	2:11:43	2:11:49	and IY should have a straight line there
107	2:12:10	2:12:16	ok
108	2:16:34	2:16:43	ok
109	2:17:4	2:17:5	and then
110	2:17:2	2:17:5	straight up
113	2:24:10	2:24:10	there s a there s  
115	2:26:31	2:26:37	after IY slope down IY d say
116	2:29:20	2:29:26	it s not a big curve
118	2:33:7	2:33:7	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
119	2:33:11	2:33:19	uhm
120	2:33:34	2:33:35	and 
121	2:34:26	2:34:26	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
123	2:38:45	2:38:46	and then
124	2:40:2	2:40:4	and then IY go straight
125	2:40:43	2:40:45	IY wanna kind of curve
126	2:41:42	2:41:49	uhm
127	2:42:4	2:42:4	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
128	2:44:23	2:44:27	and then IY  IY go up
129	2:45:7	2:45:15	uhm
130	2:45:21	2:45:22	and IY go down IY slope to the right
132	2:45:42	2:45:44	are IY anywhere near there 
133	2:46:13	2:46:17	they re there
134	2:46:43	2:46:47	ok
135	2:46:57	2:47:5	hmm
136	2:47:17	2:47:20	well
137	2:47:34	2:47:42	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
138	2:48:39	2:48:48	IY slope down again
139	2:48:49	2:48:49	ok
140	2:50:39	2:50:41	alright alright well just
141	2:51:16	2:51:22	ok well
142	2:51:35	2:51:38	and then IY re going down
144	2:52:36	2:52:38	well
145	2:53:19	2:53:23	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
146	2:54:48	2:54:52	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
147	3:0:7	3:0:7	uhm
149	3:1:59	3:2:4	like
151	3:8:10	3:8:11	and
152	3:9:42	3:9:43	where IY re going down to a plane crash
153	3:12:20	3:12:25	ok
154	3:13:16	3:13:18	and then IY slope up
155	3:13:38	3:13:45	maybe like
156	3:14:54	3:14:54	but
157	3:15:7	3:15:10	IY re kind of going  
158	3:15:32	3:15:37	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
159	3:17:27	3:17:33	what 
161	3:21:13	3:21:14	kind of across from stony desert
162	3:22:0	3:22:1	like three inches 
163	3:23:46	3:23:46	and IY re going
165	3:25:8	3:25:11	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
166	3:25:13	3:25:20	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
167	3:26:38	3:26:44	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
168	3:27:34	3:27:36	IY re starting
170	3:27:59	3:28:6	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
171	3:29:2	3:29:11	ok
173	3:30:21	3:30:25	and then IY go
175	3:35:33	3:35:33	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
176	3:36:34	3:36:37	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
178	3:41:23	3:41:24	ok IY re at the savannah
179	3:41:28	3:41:33	alright 
180	3:41:37	3:41:37	from
181	3:42:43	3:42:43	ok
182	3:43:17	3:43:24	to the white mountain
184	3:43:54	3:43:58	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
185	3:44:8	3:44:8	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
186	3:44:17	3:44:20	slight
187	3:44:17	3:44:22	ok
188	3:46:5	3:46:8	to the left
192	3:49:51	3:49:52	like
193	3:50:16	3:50:20	for about two inches
195	3:56:31	3:56:36	ok
196	3:58:35	3:58:43	uhm
197	3:59:10	3:59:16	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
199	4:0:35	4:0:37	uh like
201	4:2:17	4:2:20	four or five inches to the left
202	4:3:30	4:3:36	the slate mountain is towards the right
203	4:5:6	4:5:9	and then IY ll come to a savannah
204	4:8:4	4:8:8	after the circle
205	4:10:4	4:10:6	like four or five inches to the left
206	4:10:13	4:10:19	no
207	4:10:42	4:10:50	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
208	4:11:23	4:11:26	three inches
209	4:12:40	4:12:47	uhm
210	4:12:45	4:12:53	to the right
211	4:14:17	4:14:19	and then IY slope
213	4:15:18	4:15:27	so IY re at the hot springs
214	4:16:21	4:16:26	yes IY re going towards the lake
215	4:16:45	4:16:47	maybe IY have different things
216	4:16:52	4:17:0	ok
217	4:17:51	4:17:58	so that s about IY would say
220	4:21:17	4:21:17	like
222	4:25:4	4:25:9	three inches straight across
223	4:29:4	4:29:10	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
224	4:30:37	4:30:39	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
226	4:31:14	4:31:15	uhhh no
227	4:32:8	4:32:11	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
228	4:32:32	4:32:38	alright 
230	4:35:51	4:35:52	uhm
231	4:38:51	4:39:0	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
232	4:39:41	4:39:47	and then
233	4:39:59	4:40:8	to the lake 
234	4:41:17	4:41:19	you
236	4:43:1	4:43:4	the  
237	4:44:6	4:44:9	have a s 
238	4:46:26	4:46:32	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
239	4:47:9	4:47:10	after plane crash
240	4:48:44	4:48:49	that s about five or six inches
242	4:52:46	4:52:51	IY re sloping
243	4:54:19	4:54:27	and IY slope is about an inch long
244	4:54:52	4:54:57	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
245	4:55:42	4:55:50	so IY make that circle
246	4:56:2	4:56:9	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
247	4:56:18	4:56:18	ok
249	4:56:48	4:56:57	for like
250	4:57:28	4:57:35	ok
251	4:57:49	4:57:56	IY re starting at the stony desert
253	4:59:39	4:59:40	and IY re sloping to the left
254	5:0:7	5:0:13	are IY anywere near there 
255	5:2:11	5:2:19	and 
257	5:6:25	5:6:34	IY plane crash 
258	5:6:55	5:7:1	IY would say
261	5:9:54	5:10:2	maybe four inches on the paper
263	5:11:36	5:11:39	and then
266	5:12:35	5:12:38	for like
267	5:13:59	5:14:4	ok
268	5:17:10	5:17:16	a little
270	5:23:19	5:23:22	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
273	5:26:16	5:26:24	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
274	5:27:26	5:27:34	just do it like this ok
277	5:30:8	5:30:11	couple inches IY re sloping down
281	5:33:22	5:33:29	ok 
285	5:39:52	5:39:57	IY don t know
286	5:40:1	5:40:3	ok
287	5:42:12	5:42:13	IY just kind of slope down
288	5:43:4	5:43:6	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
290	5:48:32	5:48:41	uhm
292	5:49:38	5:49:41	uhm
293	5:52:6	5:52:6	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
294	5:53:41	5:53:45	ok
295	5:53:37	5:53:46	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
297	5:54:20	5:54:27	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
299	5:59:45	5:59:49	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
302	6:4:56	6:5:3	couple miles or something
304	6:5:53	6:5:57	and IY re going up like
307	6:7:13	6:7:19	no
308	6:7:37	6:7:41	just a slight slope
309	6:11:5	6:11:6	ok
311	6:11:56	6:11:59	IY re at the plane crash
312	6:12:24	6:12:31	ok
313	6:12:51	6:12:52	and then
314	6:13:3	6:13:3	to the left
315	6:14:58	6:15:3	and is to the left
316	6:15:9	6:15:10	about like
317	6:16:35	6:16:37	on IY sheet anyway
318	6:20:37	6:20:38	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
319	6:20:45	6:20:47	to the left
320	6:22:40	6:22:42	do IY have roman baths 
321	6:27:33	6:27:34	go up like three  three and a half inches
322	6:29:28	6:29:31	are IY in like almost the top of the
323	6:29:36	6:29:43	are IY  
324	6:32:53	6:33:2	ok well
325	6:33:44	6:33:46	an inch maybe a little bit less
326	6:33:45	6:33:51	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
327	6:33:56	6:34:5	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
328	6:34:41	6:34:45	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
329	6:35:34	6:35:41	IY move to the left
330	6:36:0	6:36:5	uhm
331	6:36:49	6:36:57	alright well IY ll keep going and see
333	6:38:22	6:38:23	and IY just go straight up
334	6:38:44	6:38:47	no there s no elephants
335	6:41:10	6:41:13	three inches
336	6:42:48	6:42:54	maybe like
341	6:51:36	6:51:42	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
342	6:52:19	6:52:24	IY re going about
start f
0	0:1:27	0:1:28	mm hmm
1	0:1:29	0:1:36	mm hmm
7	0:14:26	0:14:26	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
10	0:17:5	0:17:5	ok
13	0:21:22	0:21:23	nope
15	0:23:58	0:24:2	ok

19	0:29:29	0:29:29	mm hmm
24	0:32:59	0:33:3	IY go to a lake 
26	0:36:47	0:36:53	ok
27	0:37:45	0:37:50	yeah
31	0:40:32	0:40:36	ok

44	1:0:36	1:0:42	ok
49	1:8:49	1:8:52	IY m three inches above the savannah
53	1:13:0	1:13:6	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
54	1:12:57	1:13:6	do IY go around it 
55	1:13:37	1:13:41	ok
57	1:14:10	1:14:18	mm hmm

71	1:27:58	1:28:1	mm  mm
72	1:28:19	1:28:19	ok
76	1:34:34	1:34:42	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
78	1:41:9	1:41:15	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
82	1:49:8	1:49:9	ok
90	1:54:22	1:54:27	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
97	2:5:27	2:5:31	yeah IY see that
101	2:8:37	2:8:40	and curve down to the left 
111	2:17:30	2:17:37	up tp the right
112	2:19:22	2:19:28	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
114	2:24:28	2:24:34	so wait
117	2:29:43	2:29:50	and to the right 
122	2:35:58	2:36:4	ok
131	2:45:40	2:45:41	ok
143	2:52:9	2:52:16	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
148	3:0:18	3:0:19	IY have to back up a little bit
150	3:5:38	3:5:39	do IY go through anything 
160	3:17:44	3:17:46	and
164	3:24:14	3:24:17	IY know IY have different things so
169	3:28:4	3:28:5	am IY supposed to start at the same place

275	5:28:50	5:28:52	ok
276	5:28:56	5:29:1	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope

296	5:53:50	5:53:55	so IY go to the left of the antelope
298	5:54:37	5:54:39	 IY m at the savannah
300	6:3:37	6:3:43	to the left of the antelope
301	6:4:36	6:4:38	ok
303	6:5:24	6:5:33	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
305	6:5:55	6:6:2	do IY go by the plane crash 
306	6:6:52	6:6:52	around the top of the lake 
310	6:11:5	6:11:8	how many inches do IY think 
332	6:37:59	6:37:59	to the right 
337	6:43:58	6:44:5	ok
338	6:46:10	6:46:10	elephants

340	6:50:24	6:50:33	uh IY don t know know what to say
start g
2	0:6:40	0:6:48	ok IY plane crash isn t there
3	0:6:50	0:6:53	a quarter of an inch
4	0:8:19	0:8:24	no IY don t have a waterhole
5	0:12:39	0:12:39	are IY in like   
6	0:12:51	0:12:55	like IY re sloping
8	0:15:2	0:15:5	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
9	0:16:5	0:16:12	and then
11	0:18:13	0:18:20	uhm
12	0:19:9	0:19:15	not right at the stony desert
14	0:21:21	0:21:28	like an inch
17	0:28:43	0:28:44	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
18	0:28:49	0:28:55	a little bit too
20	0:30:10	0:30:10	so anyway
21	0:31:9	0:31:12	ok
22	0:31:7	0:31:16	IY go straight down
23	0:31:59	0:32:3	five
25	0:36:3	0:36:9	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
28	0:38:39	0:38:43	so
29	0:39:33	0:39:34	alright are IY starting  near the  
30	0:39:57	0:40:4	and IY go to the left a little bit
33	0:44:10	0:44:13	uhm and there is a stony desert
34	0:45:42	0:45:48	and then IY slope down to the left
35	0:48:6	0:48:9	well alright
36	0:50:38	0:50:44	and then
38	0:53:39	0:53:41	no IY have  
39	0:54:44	0:54:45	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
40	0:57:11	0:57:16	yes
41	0:58:39	0:58:46	around the bottom of it
42	1:0:3	1:0:5	and there s a plane crash
43	1:0:17	1:0:20	ok
45	1:1:58	1:2:5	no IY don t have any rocks
46	1:4:16	1:4:19	yes
47	1:4:42	1:4:43	ok and then IY re going
48	1:6:52	1:7:0	maybe
50	1:9:13	1:9:18	uhm
51	1:11:3	1:11:8	after that IY go straight again
52	1:11:21	1:11:26	and IY re going straight up
56	1:13:44	1:13:47	IY make
58	1:14:49	1:14:55	uhm
59	1:15:49	1:15:50	and then IY are
60	1:16:26	1:16:31	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
61	1:18:6	1:18:8	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
62	1:19:14	1:19:18	and then
63	1:19:24	1:19:31	that s IY little slope
65	1:20:48	1:20:49	it s right next to it
66	1:21:10	1:21:18	IY re just going down
67	1:24:5	1:24:14	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
68	1:25:5	1:25:14	to IY right 
70	1:27:1	1:27:9	ok
73	1:30:48	1:30:50	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
74	1:31:38	1:31:43	IY re actually starting like right
75	1:33:8	1:33:13	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
77	1:35:53	1:36:0	ok
79	1:44:51	1:44:55	uhm
80	1:44:57	1:45:4	is the plane crash  
81	1:48:6	1:48:14	uhm
83	1:49:8	1:49:15	and that s where the plane crash is
84	1:50:1	1:50:5	and
85	1:50:19	1:50:24	IY got that 
86	1:50:29	1:50:36	IY re going like
87	1:52:35	1:52:40	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
88	1:53:58	1:54:4	and it slopes a little bit to the right
89	1:54:19	1:54:21	well just
91	1:56:30	1:56:30	ok
92	2:0:1	2:0:2	uhm

94	2:3:20	2:3:29	then
95	2:4:2	2:4:5	so IY go three inches straight
96	2:5:10	2:5:14	uhm
98	2:7:2	2:7:5	ok
99	2:8:0	2:8:2	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
100	2:8:27	2:8:31	ok
102	2:8:49	2:8:49	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
103	2:9:34	2:9:39	like
104	2:10:50	2:10:50	what 
105	2:11:0	2:11:9	like maybe an inch
106	2:11:43	2:11:49	and IY should have a straight line there
107	2:12:10	2:12:16	ok
108	2:16:34	2:16:43	ok
109	2:17:4	2:17:5	and then
110	2:17:2	2:17:5	straight up
113	2:24:10	2:24:10	there s a there s  
115	2:26:31	2:26:37	after IY slope down IY d say
116	2:29:20	2:29:26	it s not a big curve
118	2:33:7	2:33:7	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
119	2:33:11	2:33:19	uhm
120	2:33:34	2:33:35	and 
121	2:34:26	2:34:26	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
123	2:38:45	2:38:46	and then
124	2:40:2	2:40:4	and then IY go straight
125	2:40:43	2:40:45	IY wanna kind of curve
126	2:41:42	2:41:49	uhm
127	2:42:4	2:42:4	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
128	2:44:23	2:44:27	and then IY  IY go up
129	2:45:7	2:45:15	uhm
130	2:45:21	2:45:22	and IY go down IY slope to the right
132	2:45:42	2:45:44	are IY anywhere near there 
133	2:46:13	2:46:17	they re there
134	2:46:43	2:46:47	ok
135	2:46:57	2:47:5	hmm
136	2:47:17	2:47:20	well
137	2:47:34	2:47:42	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
138	2:48:39	2:48:48	IY slope down again
139	2:48:49	2:48:49	ok
140	2:50:39	2:50:41	alright alright well just
141	2:51:16	2:51:22	ok well
142	2:51:35	2:51:38	and then IY re going down
144	2:52:36	2:52:38	well
145	2:53:19	2:53:23	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
146	2:54:48	2:54:52	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
147	3:0:7	3:0:7	uhm
149	3:1:59	3:2:4	like
151	3:8:10	3:8:11	and
152	3:9:42	3:9:43	where IY re going down to a plane crash
153	3:12:20	3:12:25	ok
154	3:13:16	3:13:18	and then IY slope up
155	3:13:38	3:13:45	maybe like
156	3:14:54	3:14:54	but
157	3:15:7	3:15:10	IY re kind of going  
158	3:15:32	3:15:37	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
159	3:17:27	3:17:33	what 
161	3:21:13	3:21:14	kind of across from stony desert
162	3:22:0	3:22:1	like three inches 
163	3:23:46	3:23:46	and IY re going
165	3:25:8	3:25:11	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
166	3:25:13	3:25:20	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
167	3:26:38	3:26:44	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
168	3:27:34	3:27:36	IY re starting
170	3:27:59	3:28:6	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
171	3:29:2	3:29:11	ok
173	3:30:21	3:30:25	and then IY go
175	3:35:33	3:35:33	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
176	3:36:34	3:36:37	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
178	3:41:23	3:41:24	ok IY re at the savannah
179	3:41:28	3:41:33	alright 
180	3:41:37	3:41:37	from
181	3:42:43	3:42:43	ok
182	3:43:17	3:43:24	to the white mountain
184	3:43:54	3:43:58	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
185	3:44:8	3:44:8	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
186	3:44:17	3:44:20	slight
187	3:44:17	3:44:22	ok
188	3:46:5	3:46:8	to the left
192	3:49:51	3:49:52	like
193	3:50:16	3:50:20	for about two inches
195	3:56:31	3:56:36	ok
196	3:58:35	3:58:43	uhm
197	3:59:10	3:59:16	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
199	4:0:35	4:0:37	uh like
201	4:2:17	4:2:20	four or five inches to the left
202	4:3:30	4:3:36	the slate mountain is towards the right
203	4:5:6	4:5:9	and then IY ll come to a savannah
204	4:8:4	4:8:8	after the circle
205	4:10:4	4:10:6	like four or five inches to the left
206	4:10:13	4:10:19	no
207	4:10:42	4:10:50	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
208	4:11:23	4:11:26	three inches
209	4:12:40	4:12:47	uhm
210	4:12:45	4:12:53	to the right
211	4:14:17	4:14:19	and then IY slope
213	4:15:18	4:15:27	so IY re at the hot springs
214	4:16:21	4:16:26	yes IY re going towards the lake
215	4:16:45	4:16:47	maybe IY have different things
216	4:16:52	4:17:0	ok
217	4:17:51	4:17:58	so that s about IY would say
220	4:21:17	4:21:17	like
222	4:25:4	4:25:9	three inches straight across
223	4:29:4	4:29:10	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
224	4:30:37	4:30:39	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
226	4:31:14	4:31:15	uhhh no
227	4:32:8	4:32:11	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
228	4:32:32	4:32:38	alright 
230	4:35:51	4:35:52	uhm
231	4:38:51	4:39:0	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
232	4:39:41	4:39:47	and then
233	4:39:59	4:40:8	to the lake 
234	4:41:17	4:41:19	you
236	4:43:1	4:43:4	the  
237	4:44:6	4:44:9	have a s 
238	4:46:26	4:46:32	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
239	4:47:9	4:47:10	after plane crash
240	4:48:44	4:48:49	that s about five or six inches
242	4:52:46	4:52:51	IY re sloping
243	4:54:19	4:54:27	and IY slope is about an inch long
244	4:54:52	4:54:57	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
245	4:55:42	4:55:50	so IY make that circle
246	4:56:2	4:56:9	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
247	4:56:18	4:56:18	ok
249	4:56:48	4:56:57	for like
250	4:57:28	4:57:35	ok
251	4:57:49	4:57:56	IY re starting at the stony desert
253	4:59:39	4:59:40	and IY re sloping to the left
254	5:0:7	5:0:13	are IY anywere near there 
255	5:2:11	5:2:19	and 
257	5:6:25	5:6:34	IY plane crash 
258	5:6:55	5:7:1	IY would say
261	5:9:54	5:10:2	maybe four inches on the paper
263	5:11:36	5:11:39	and then
266	5:12:35	5:12:38	for like
267	5:13:59	5:14:4	ok
268	5:17:10	5:17:16	a little
270	5:23:19	5:23:22	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
273	5:26:16	5:26:24	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
274	5:27:26	5:27:34	just do it like this ok
277	5:30:8	5:30:11	couple inches IY re sloping down
281	5:33:22	5:33:29	ok 
285	5:39:52	5:39:57	IY don t know
286	5:40:1	5:40:3	ok
287	5:42:12	5:42:13	IY just kind of slope down
288	5:43:4	5:43:6	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
290	5:48:32	5:48:41	uhm
292	5:49:38	5:49:41	uhm
293	5:52:6	5:52:6	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
294	5:53:41	5:53:45	ok
295	5:53:37	5:53:46	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
297	5:54:20	5:54:27	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
299	5:59:45	5:59:49	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
302	6:4:56	6:5:3	couple miles or something
304	6:5:53	6:5:57	and IY re going up like
307	6:7:13	6:7:19	no
308	6:7:37	6:7:41	just a slight slope
309	6:11:5	6:11:6	ok
311	6:11:56	6:11:59	IY re at the plane crash
312	6:12:24	6:12:31	ok
313	6:12:51	6:12:52	and then
314	6:13:3	6:13:3	to the left
315	6:14:58	6:15:3	and is to the left
316	6:15:9	6:15:10	about like
317	6:16:35	6:16:37	on IY sheet anyway
318	6:20:37	6:20:38	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
319	6:20:45	6:20:47	to the left
320	6:22:40	6:22:42	do IY have roman baths 
321	6:27:33	6:27:34	go up like three  three and a half inches
322	6:29:28	6:29:31	are IY in like almost the top of the
323	6:29:36	6:29:43	are IY  
324	6:32:53	6:33:2	ok well
325	6:33:44	6:33:46	an inch maybe a little bit less
326	6:33:45	6:33:51	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
327	6:33:56	6:34:5	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
