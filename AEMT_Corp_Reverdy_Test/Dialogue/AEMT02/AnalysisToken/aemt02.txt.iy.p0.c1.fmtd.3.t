start
start g
1	0:1:33	0:1:34	and that s where the plane crash is
2	0:2:9	0:2:11	uhm and there is a stony desert
3	0:3:21	0:3:27	uhm
4	0:4:24	0:4:29	like
5	0:6:25	0:6:32	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
6	0:7:11	0:7:11	and IY re going
7	0:8:16	0:8:21	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
8	0:11:20	0:11:22	IY re sloping
9	0:11:47	0:11:53	uhm
10	0:11:54	0:11:56	probably the same thing
11	0:11:47	0:11:56	ok IY re at the savannah
12	0:14:38	0:14:44	just do it like this ok
13	0:14:36	0:14:45	and then IY go straight
15	0:18:25	0:18:27	like three inches 
16	0:18:54	0:19:3	uhm
17	0:21:46	0:21:53	ok
18	0:21:51	0:21:55	ok
19	0:23:50	0:23:55	ok
20	0:24:11	0:24:12	alright 
21	0:24:26	0:24:35	uhm
23	0:29:30	0:29:36	five
25	0:30:12	0:30:13	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
26	0:30:11	0:30:20	like
27	0:30:58	0:30:58	straight up
28	0:32:31	0:32:40	IY go straight down
30	0:35:6	0:35:6	that s IY little slope
31	0:37:50	0:37:58	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
32	0:38:29	0:38:34	a quarter of an inch
33	0:40:54	0:41:2	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
34	0:42:25	0:42:26	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
36	0:42:45	0:42:47	IY re starting at the stony desert
37	0:42:54	0:42:58	maybe like
38	0:42:58	0:43:4	it s not a big curve
39	0:45:44	0:45:53	uhm
40	0:48:34	0:48:39	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
43	0:49:44	0:49:48	so that s about IY would say
44	0:50:1	0:50:2	ok
45	0:50:14	0:50:20	and then
46	0:50:20	0:50:22	IY make
47	0:50:42	0:50:51	yes IY re going towards the lake
49	0:52:14	0:52:19	ok
50	0:52:44	0:52:48	IY re just going down
51	0:53:23	0:53:24	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
53	0:54:33	0:54:35	and then IY slope
54	0:55:56	0:56:4	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
58	1:2:34	1:2:36	well alright
60	1:4:10	1:4:18	ok
61	1:4:24	1:4:25	well
63	1:4:41	1:4:47	and there s a plane crash
65	1:5:18	1:5:19	kind of across from stony desert
67	1:6:1	1:6:9	uhhh no
68	1:6:15	1:6:18	ok
69	1:6:33	1:6:42	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
70	1:8:5	1:8:11	so
71	1:13:16	1:13:20	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
72	1:15:17	1:15:25	ok 
74	1:16:21	1:16:24	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
75	1:17:3	1:17:3	from
77	1:19:26	1:19:33	slight
78	1:19:31	1:19:38	IY re going like
79	1:19:39	1:19:45	and then
80	1:20:30	1:20:33	like four or five inches to the left
87	1:26:16	1:26:16	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
88	1:26:57	1:27:1	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
89	1:27:15	1:27:20	ok
90	1:29:32	1:29:39	the  
93	1:33:18	1:33:24	so IY go three inches straight
94	1:33:42	1:33:42	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
95	1:33:50	1:33:51	uhm
97	1:35:44	1:35:53	around the bottom of it
98	1:36:13	1:36:22	no
99	1:37:35	1:37:38	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
100	1:38:42	1:38:45	maybe like
101	1:39:39	1:39:42	uhm
102	1:40:35	1:40:39	but
103	1:41:27	1:41:33	so IY make that circle
106	1:47:4	1:47:11	ok
107	1:49:16	1:49:25	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
109	1:50:5	1:50:7	a little
111	1:51:59	1:52:1	and IY re sloping to the left
113	1:53:0	1:53:6	ok
114	1:53:51	1:53:56	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
115	1:54:10	1:54:13	and then
116	1:55:8	1:55:12	is the plane crash  
119	1:57:6	1:57:8	well
122	2:0:19	2:0:25	and IY slope is about an inch long
124	2:4:31	2:4:34	yes
125	2:5:12	2:5:15	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
126	2:5:48	2:5:57	ok
127	2:8:0	2:8:6	are IY in like   
128	2:8:9	2:8:18	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
129	2:8:55	2:9:2	IY would say
131	2:16:12	2:16:15	what 
132	2:16:31	2:16:40	ok
133	2:17:52	2:17:55	alright are IY starting  near the  
134	2:18:8	2:18:8	ok
135	2:21:34	2:21:42	ok
136	2:21:39	2:21:43	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
137	2:21:42	2:21:44	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
138	2:22:25	2:22:25	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
139	2:23:21	2:23:22	IY got that 
140	2:26:12	2:26:19	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
141	2:27:30	2:27:33	after that IY go straight again
142	2:29:0	2:29:4	uhm
143	2:30:39	2:30:44	ok
144	2:31:43	2:31:51	and 
148	2:37:51	2:37:52	after plane crash
149	2:39:10	2:39:13	ok
150	2:39:13	2:39:15	IY re starting
153	2:43:59	2:44:6	four or five inches to the left
155	2:46:14	2:46:17	not right at the stony desert
156	2:46:42	2:46:50	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
157	2:46:56	2:47:0	ok
158	2:46:57	2:47:4	IY re actually starting like right
159	2:49:6	2:49:10	IY just kind of slope down
160	2:49:10	2:49:15	so anyway
161	2:50:29	2:50:36	and IY just go straight up
162	2:51:32	2:51:40	IY plane crash 
164	2:52:15	2:52:15	no there s no elephants
165	2:55:21	2:55:25	no IY have  
166	2:56:14	2:56:15	to the white mountain
167	2:59:17	2:59:20	to IY right 
168	2:59:28	2:59:36	and IY re going up like
169	3:2:25	3:2:31	no
170	3:3:4	3:3:8	alright well IY ll keep going and see
171	3:6:36	3:6:38	they re there
173	3:7:12	3:7:14	for like
174	3:7:26	3:7:27	and IY should have a straight line there
176	3:8:3	3:8:9	go up like three  three and a half inches
178	3:10:8	3:10:14	and IY go to the left a little bit
179	3:12:6	3:12:13	and then IY re going down
180	3:14:56	3:14:57	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
181	3:21:1	3:21:6	like
182	3:21:45	3:21:54	IY slope down again
183	3:23:3	3:23:10	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
184	3:26:6	3:26:7	then
185	3:27:47	3:27:53	IY move to the left
186	3:29:27	3:29:27	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
188	3:33:44	3:33:45	three inches
189	3:35:0	3:35:2	do IY have roman baths 
190	3:36:46	3:36:48	and then
191	3:37:25	3:37:31	have a s 
192	3:37:46	3:37:50	what 
194	3:38:57	3:38:59	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
196	3:40:54	3:40:57	and then
197	3:41:9	3:41:13	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
198	3:41:16	3:41:16	and
199	3:42:39	3:42:46	well just
202	3:44:51	3:44:57	uhm
203	3:47:26	3:47:31	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
204	3:47:45	3:47:49	couple miles or something
207	3:52:10	3:52:10	and then IY go
208	3:52:28	3:52:34	uhm
209	3:53:2	3:53:5	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
210	3:53:30	3:53:35	IY re at the plane crash
211	3:54:24	3:54:24	like maybe an inch
212	3:55:17	3:55:20	uhm
213	3:55:25	3:55:33	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
214	3:56:47	3:56:52	and then IY slope down to the left
215	3:56:54	3:56:56	and then IY are
216	3:57:18	3:57:26	uhm
217	3:58:56	3:59:5	maybe four inches on the paper
219	4:0:46	4:0:48	on IY sheet anyway
221	4:1:44	4:1:45	you
223	4:4:17	4:4:18	to the right
224	4:4:41	4:4:50	ok
225	4:5:40	4:5:42	and it slopes a little bit to the right
226	4:7:10	4:7:11	no IY don t have any rocks
228	4:10:41	4:10:47	are IY anywhere near there 
229	4:12:40	4:12:42	uhm
230	4:13:49	4:13:58	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
231	4:15:20	4:15:28	after the circle
232	4:16:38	4:16:42	three inches straight across
233	4:20:52	4:20:53	IY re kind of going  
235	4:21:33	4:21:39	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
236	4:22:42	4:22:50	to the lake 
237	4:23:1	4:23:1	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
238	4:28:59	4:29:3	like an inch
240	4:30:29	4:30:30	an inch maybe a little bit less
241	4:32:6	4:32:13	ok
243	4:37:5	4:37:13	ok IY plane crash isn t there
244	4:40:1	4:40:7	to the left
245	4:45:50	4:45:51	to the left
246	4:47:4	4:47:13	hmm
248	4:48:37	4:48:38	alright alright well just
249	4:51:58	4:51:58	about like
250	4:52:5	4:52:11	after IY slope down IY d say
251	4:53:51	4:53:56	it s right next to it
252	4:54:34	4:54:43	for like
253	4:57:46	4:57:46	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
254	4:58:25	4:58:26	the slate mountain is towards the right
256	4:59:35	4:59:35	are IY anywere near there 
257	4:59:41	4:59:43	couple inches IY re sloping down
259	5:2:6	5:2:15	ok well
261	5:6:41	5:6:46	and then IY ll come to a savannah
262	5:7:21	5:7:30	and is to the left
264	5:7:34	5:7:42	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
266	5:9:11	5:9:20	ok and then IY re going
268	5:11:38	5:11:43	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
269	5:12:43	5:12:45	are IY  
270	5:13:24	5:13:32	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
271	5:14:38	5:14:43	uhm
272	5:15:33	5:15:33	uhm
274	5:21:20	5:21:29	maybe
275	5:21:41	5:21:42	like IY re sloping
277	5:22:44	5:22:46	and then IY  IY go up
280	5:27:29	5:27:36	that s about five or six inches
281	5:27:58	5:27:59	are IY in like almost the top of the
283	5:28:11	5:28:14	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
285	5:32:49	5:32:56	yes
286	5:33:27	5:33:32	alright 
287	5:34:15	5:34:20	no IY don t have a waterhole
288	5:35:3	5:35:3	so IY re at the hot springs
289	5:36:0	5:36:1	IY don t know
290	5:36:5	5:36:13	ok
292	5:41:11	5:41:14	and then IY slope up
293	5:44:8	5:44:14	ok well
294	5:48:56	5:49:0	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
295	5:49:38	5:49:47	and then
296	5:55:7	5:55:13	IY wanna kind of curve
297	5:56:58	5:56:58	ok
298	5:57:39	5:57:40	just a slight slope
300	5:58:53	5:59:0	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
302	6:0:22	6:0:26	uh like
303	6:1:30	6:1:33	where IY re going down to a plane crash
304	6:1:57	6:1:57	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
305	6:5:15	6:5:24	for about two inches
306	6:6:31	6:6:31	maybe IY have different things
307	6:11:49	6:11:51	uhm
309	6:13:42	6:13:43	to the left
310	6:13:50	6:13:55	and

66	1:5:51	1:5:52	ok
73	1:15:33	1:15:33	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
76	1:19:11	1:19:19	around the lake to the top 
81	1:22:17	1:22:17	nope
82	1:23:28	1:23:31	yeah and IY went straight up
83	1:23:52	1:24:1	and to the right 
84	1:24:13	1:24:18	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
85	1:24:35	1:24:44	around the top of the lake 
86	1:24:56	1:25:3	ok

130	2:15:1	2:15:5	yeah
145	2:31:49	2:31:55	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
146	2:34:57	2:34:57	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
147	2:37:23	2:37:24	ok

154	2:44:17	2:44:25	up tp the right
163	2:52:5	2:52:13	IY ve a plane crash though
172	3:6:54	3:6:54	 IY m at the savannah
175	3:7:55	3:8:4	ok
177	3:9:29	3:9:30	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
187	3:32:6	3:32:15	ok
193	3:38:46	3:38:49	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
195	3:39:46	3:39:54	ok
200	3:43:20	3:43:24	IY hit some rocks though
201	3:44:21	3:44:28	do IY go by the plane crash 
205	3:51:27	3:51:33	ok
206	3:51:50	3:51:59	yeah IY see that
218	3:59:16	3:59:22	so IY go to the left of the antelope
220	4:0:59	4:1:5	to 
222	4:3:19	4:3:24	so wait
227	4:8:35	4:8:44	ok wait hold on
234	4:21:16	4:21:23	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now

242	4:35:12	4:35:15	yeah 
247	4:48:3	4:48:7	ok
255	4:58:57	4:58:58	IY have to back up a little bit
258	5:0:56	5:1:3	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
260	5:4:16	5:4:19	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
263	5:7:37	5:7:38	IY m three inches above the savannah
265	5:7:53	5:8:0	IY know IY have different things so
267	5:10:23	5:10:26	how many inches do IY think 
273	5:20:16	5:20:18	ok
276	5:22:0	5:22:7	mm hmm
278	5:23:49	5:23:49	ok
279	5:27:21	5:27:25	ok
282	5:27:57	5:28:6	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
284	5:31:24	5:31:33	mm hmm
291	5:39:12	5:39:20	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
299	5:57:54	5:57:56	elephants 
301	5:59:45	5:59:46	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
308	6:12:9	6:12:11	ok
311	6:14:13	6:14:13	ok
313	6:17:47	6:17:47	mm  mm
317	6:18:54	6:19:1	nope IY have a white mountain
318	6:21:17	6:21:18	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
320	6:22:56	6:22:56	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
322	6:24:30	6:24:34	yeah
324	6:26:2	6:26:6	do IY go around it 
327	6:36:54	6:36:56	and there s a collapsed shelter
331	6:43:26	6:43:33	ok
332	6:45:42	6:45:48	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
333	6:48:4	6:48:13	mm hmm
337	6:53:31	6:53:36	oh
338	6:55:0	6:55:6	uhm IY
340	6:57:21	6:57:30	yeah
start g
1	0:1:33	0:1:34	and that s where the plane crash is
2	0:2:9	0:2:11	uhm and there is a stony desert
3	0:3:21	0:3:27	uhm
4	0:4:24	0:4:29	like
5	0:6:25	0:6:32	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
6	0:7:11	0:7:11	and IY re going
7	0:8:16	0:8:21	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
8	0:11:20	0:11:22	IY re sloping
9	0:11:47	0:11:53	uhm
10	0:11:54	0:11:56	probably the same thing
11	0:11:47	0:11:56	ok IY re at the savannah
12	0:14:38	0:14:44	just do it like this ok
13	0:14:36	0:14:45	and then IY go straight
15	0:18:25	0:18:27	like three inches 
16	0:18:54	0:19:3	uhm
17	0:21:46	0:21:53	ok
18	0:21:51	0:21:55	ok

23	0:29:30	0:29:36	five
25	0:30:12	0:30:13	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
26	0:30:11	0:30:20	like
27	0:30:58	0:30:58	straight up
28	0:32:31	0:32:40	IY go straight down
30	0:35:6	0:35:6	that s IY little slope
31	0:37:50	0:37:58	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
32	0:38:29	0:38:34	a quarter of an inch
33	0:40:54	0:41:2	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
34	0:42:25	0:42:26	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
36	0:42:45	0:42:47	IY re starting at the stony desert
37	0:42:54	0:42:58	maybe like
38	0:42:58	0:43:4	it s not a big curve
39	0:45:44	0:45:53	uhm
40	0:48:34	0:48:39	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
43	0:49:44	0:49:48	so that s about IY would say
44	0:50:1	0:50:2	ok
45	0:50:14	0:50:20	and then
46	0:50:20	0:50:22	IY make
47	0:50:42	0:50:51	yes IY re going towards the lake
49	0:52:14	0:52:19	ok
50	0:52:44	0:52:48	IY re just going down
51	0:53:23	0:53:24	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
53	0:54:33	0:54:35	and then IY slope
54	0:55:56	0:56:4	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
58	1:2:34	1:2:36	well alright
60	1:4:10	1:4:18	ok
61	1:4:24	1:4:25	well
63	1:4:41	1:4:47	and there s a plane crash
65	1:5:18	1:5:19	kind of across from stony desert
67	1:6:1	1:6:9	uhhh no
68	1:6:15	1:6:18	ok
69	1:6:33	1:6:42	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
70	1:8:5	1:8:11	so
71	1:13:16	1:13:20	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
72	1:15:17	1:15:25	ok 
74	1:16:21	1:16:24	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
75	1:17:3	1:17:3	from
77	1:19:26	1:19:33	slight
78	1:19:31	1:19:38	IY re going like
79	1:19:39	1:19:45	and then
80	1:20:30	1:20:33	like four or five inches to the left
87	1:26:16	1:26:16	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
88	1:26:57	1:27:1	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
89	1:27:15	1:27:20	ok
90	1:29:32	1:29:39	the  
93	1:33:18	1:33:24	so IY go three inches straight
94	1:33:42	1:33:42	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
95	1:33:50	1:33:51	uhm
97	1:35:44	1:35:53	around the bottom of it
98	1:36:13	1:36:22	no
99	1:37:35	1:37:38	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
100	1:38:42	1:38:45	maybe like
101	1:39:39	1:39:42	uhm
102	1:40:35	1:40:39	but
103	1:41:27	1:41:33	so IY make that circle
106	1:47:4	1:47:11	ok
107	1:49:16	1:49:25	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
109	1:50:5	1:50:7	a little
111	1:51:59	1:52:1	and IY re sloping to the left
113	1:53:0	1:53:6	ok
114	1:53:51	1:53:56	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
115	1:54:10	1:54:13	and then
116	1:55:8	1:55:12	is the plane crash  
119	1:57:6	1:57:8	well
122	2:0:19	2:0:25	and IY slope is about an inch long
124	2:4:31	2:4:34	yes
125	2:5:12	2:5:15	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
126	2:5:48	2:5:57	ok
127	2:8:0	2:8:6	are IY in like   
128	2:8:9	2:8:18	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
129	2:8:55	2:9:2	IY would say
131	2:16:12	2:16:15	what 
132	2:16:31	2:16:40	ok
133	2:17:52	2:17:55	alright are IY starting  near the  
134	2:18:8	2:18:8	ok
135	2:21:34	2:21:42	ok
136	2:21:39	2:21:43	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
137	2:21:42	2:21:44	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
138	2:22:25	2:22:25	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
139	2:23:21	2:23:22	IY got that 
140	2:26:12	2:26:19	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
141	2:27:30	2:27:33	after that IY go straight again
142	2:29:0	2:29:4	uhm
143	2:30:39	2:30:44	ok
144	2:31:43	2:31:51	and 
148	2:37:51	2:37:52	after plane crash
149	2:39:10	2:39:13	ok
150	2:39:13	2:39:15	IY re starting
153	2:43:59	2:44:6	four or five inches to the left
155	2:46:14	2:46:17	not right at the stony desert
156	2:46:42	2:46:50	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
157	2:46:56	2:47:0	ok
158	2:46:57	2:47:4	IY re actually starting like right
159	2:49:6	2:49:10	IY just kind of slope down
160	2:49:10	2:49:15	so anyway
161	2:50:29	2:50:36	and IY just go straight up
162	2:51:32	2:51:40	IY plane crash 
164	2:52:15	2:52:15	no there s no elephants
165	2:55:21	2:55:25	no IY have  
166	2:56:14	2:56:15	to the white mountain
167	2:59:17	2:59:20	to IY right 
168	2:59:28	2:59:36	and IY re going up like
169	3:2:25	3:2:31	no
170	3:3:4	3:3:8	alright well IY ll keep going and see
171	3:6:36	3:6:38	they re there
173	3:7:12	3:7:14	for like
174	3:7:26	3:7:27	and IY should have a straight line there
176	3:8:3	3:8:9	go up like three  three and a half inches
178	3:10:8	3:10:14	and IY go to the left a little bit
179	3:12:6	3:12:13	and then IY re going down
180	3:14:56	3:14:57	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
181	3:21:1	3:21:6	like
182	3:21:45	3:21:54	IY slope down again
183	3:23:3	3:23:10	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
184	3:26:6	3:26:7	then
185	3:27:47	3:27:53	IY move to the left
186	3:29:27	3:29:27	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
188	3:33:44	3:33:45	three inches
189	3:35:0	3:35:2	do IY have roman baths 
190	3:36:46	3:36:48	and then
191	3:37:25	3:37:31	have a s 
192	3:37:46	3:37:50	what 
194	3:38:57	3:38:59	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
196	3:40:54	3:40:57	and then
197	3:41:9	3:41:13	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
198	3:41:16	3:41:16	and
199	3:42:39	3:42:46	well just
202	3:44:51	3:44:57	uhm
203	3:47:26	3:47:31	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
204	3:47:45	3:47:49	couple miles or something
207	3:52:10	3:52:10	and then IY go
208	3:52:28	3:52:34	uhm
209	3:53:2	3:53:5	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
210	3:53:30	3:53:35	IY re at the plane crash
211	3:54:24	3:54:24	like maybe an inch
212	3:55:17	3:55:20	uhm
213	3:55:25	3:55:33	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
214	3:56:47	3:56:52	and then IY slope down to the left
215	3:56:54	3:56:56	and then IY are
216	3:57:18	3:57:26	uhm
217	3:58:56	3:59:5	maybe four inches on the paper
219	4:0:46	4:0:48	on IY sheet anyway
221	4:1:44	4:1:45	you
223	4:4:17	4:4:18	to the right
224	4:4:41	4:4:50	ok
225	4:5:40	4:5:42	and it slopes a little bit to the right
226	4:7:10	4:7:11	no IY don t have any rocks
228	4:10:41	4:10:47	are IY anywhere near there 
229	4:12:40	4:12:42	uhm
230	4:13:49	4:13:58	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
231	4:15:20	4:15:28	after the circle
232	4:16:38	4:16:42	three inches straight across
233	4:20:52	4:20:53	IY re kind of going  
235	4:21:33	4:21:39	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
236	4:22:42	4:22:50	to the lake 
237	4:23:1	4:23:1	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
238	4:28:59	4:29:3	like an inch
240	4:30:29	4:30:30	an inch maybe a little bit less
241	4:32:6	4:32:13	ok
243	4:37:5	4:37:13	ok IY plane crash isn t there
244	4:40:1	4:40:7	to the left
245	4:45:50	4:45:51	to the left
246	4:47:4	4:47:13	hmm
248	4:48:37	4:48:38	alright alright well just
249	4:51:58	4:51:58	about like
250	4:52:5	4:52:11	after IY slope down IY d say
251	4:53:51	4:53:56	it s right next to it
252	4:54:34	4:54:43	for like
253	4:57:46	4:57:46	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
254	4:58:25	4:58:26	the slate mountain is towards the right
256	4:59:35	4:59:35	are IY anywere near there 
257	4:59:41	4:59:43	couple inches IY re sloping down
259	5:2:6	5:2:15	ok well
261	5:6:41	5:6:46	and then IY ll come to a savannah
262	5:7:21	5:7:30	and is to the left
264	5:7:34	5:7:42	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
266	5:9:11	5:9:20	ok and then IY re going
268	5:11:38	5:11:43	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
269	5:12:43	5:12:45	are IY  
270	5:13:24	5:13:32	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
271	5:14:38	5:14:43	uhm
272	5:15:33	5:15:33	uhm
274	5:21:20	5:21:29	maybe
275	5:21:41	5:21:42	like IY re sloping
277	5:22:44	5:22:46	and then IY  IY go up
280	5:27:29	5:27:36	that s about five or six inches
281	5:27:58	5:27:59	are IY in like almost the top of the
283	5:28:11	5:28:14	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
285	5:32:49	5:32:56	yes
286	5:33:27	5:33:32	alright 
287	5:34:15	5:34:20	no IY don t have a waterhole
288	5:35:3	5:35:3	so IY re at the hot springs
289	5:36:0	5:36:1	IY don t know
290	5:36:5	5:36:13	ok
292	5:41:11	5:41:14	and then IY slope up
293	5:44:8	5:44:14	ok well
294	5:48:56	5:49:0	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
295	5:49:38	5:49:47	and then
296	5:55:7	5:55:13	IY wanna kind of curve
297	5:56:58	5:56:58	ok
298	5:57:39	5:57:40	just a slight slope
300	5:58:53	5:59:0	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
302	6:0:22	6:0:26	uh like
303	6:1:30	6:1:33	where IY re going down to a plane crash
304	6:1:57	6:1:57	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
305	6:5:15	6:5:24	for about two inches
306	6:6:31	6:6:31	maybe IY have different things
307	6:11:49	6:11:51	uhm
309	6:13:42	6:13:43	to the left
310	6:13:50	6:13:55	and 
312	6:17:3	6:17:5	and
314	6:17:44	6:17:47	three inches
315	6:18:4	6:18:8	and IY go down IY slope to the right
316	6:18:32	6:18:40	like
319	6:22:5	6:22:12	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
321	6:23:40	6:23:45	ok
