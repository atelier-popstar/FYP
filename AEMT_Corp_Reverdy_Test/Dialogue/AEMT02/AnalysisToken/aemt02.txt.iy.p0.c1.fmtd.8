0:2:4	0:2:6	g	105	126			and then IY go
0:3:45	0:3:49	g	166	229			and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
0:3:50	0:3:50	g	208	230			so IY re at the hot springs
0:4:53	0:4:55	g	83	295			to IY right 
0:9:10	0:9:15	f	18	555			ok
0:9:13	0:9:16	g	280	556			ok
0:9:24	0:9:27	f	202	567			ok wait hold on
0:9:50	0:9:52	g	188	592			IY just kind of slope down
0:18:53	0:18:54	f	315	1134			 IY m at the savannah
0:19:53	0:20:1	f	275	1201			do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
0:20:27	0:20:29	g	229	1229			there s a there s  
0:27:46	0:27:49	g	203	1669			are IY in like almost the top of the
0:28:32	0:28:32	g	44	1712			ok 
0:29:3	0:29:3	g	207	1743			kind of across from stony desert
0:29:43	0:29:48	g	72	1788			aways about like four inches  four or five inches
0:30:12	0:30:13	f	158	1813			IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
0:31:1	0:31:4	g	312	1864			and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
0:31:42	0:31:48	g	28	1908			three inches
0:32:30	0:32:34	g	200	1954			and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
0:33:31	0:33:32	g	238	2012			and IY re going up like
0:34:28	0:34:35	g	79	2075			IY re actually starting like right
0:34:48	0:34:53	g	93	2093			and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
0:38:1	0:38:6	f	146	2286			mm  mm
0:39:43	0:39:46	g	113	2386			and IY just go straight up
0:39:53	0:39:55	f	107	2395			ok
0:40:8	0:40:9	g	201	2409			to the left
0:40:44	0:40:51	g	88	2451			IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
0:41:9	0:41:11	f	0	2471			ok
0:43:58	0:44:3	g	80	2643			ok
0:44:16	0:44:19	f	71	2659			ok
0:44:31	0:44:40	f	177	2680			am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
0:45:11	0:45:15	g	95	2715			well
0:47:32	0:47:39	f	84	2859			so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
0:48:42	0:48:51	g	185	2931			ok
0:52:39	0:52:44	g	244	3164			ok well
0:54:38	0:54:44	f	241	3284			uh IY don t know know what to say
0:54:54	0:54:57	g	329	3297			well alright

0:56:57	0:57:6	g	117	3426			and then
0:59:49	0:59:56	g	318	3596			and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
1:1:43	1:1:46	g	227	3706			the slate mountain is towards the right
1:2:23	1:2:23	g	316	3743			ok
1:4:28	1:4:30	f	322	3870			yeah and IY went straight up
1:4:33	1:4:35	f	39	3875			yeah
1:6:35	1:6:37	g	143	3997			like
1:6:38	1:6:41	g	235	4001			oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
1:6:50	1:6:57	g	86	4017			maybe IY have different things
1:7:44	1:7:52	g	245	4072			and then
1:8:17	1:8:22	g	60	4102			ok
1:9:52	1:9:55	g	17	4195			now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
1:11:26	1:11:29	f	179	4289			do IY go through anything 
1:13:42	1:13:45	g	108	4425			IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
1:14:7	1:14:16	g	239	4456			to the lake 
1:15:37	1:15:38	g	214	4538			uhm
1:17:23	1:17:23	g	58	4643			and then IY go straight
1:18:2	1:18:4	g	1	4684			yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
1:18:54	1:18:58	g	110	4738			and then IY re going down
1:19:29	1:19:31	f	91	4771			yep
1:20:25	1:20:30	f	52	4830			and then what 
1:20:40	1:20:41	f	59	4841			mm hmm
1:21:51	1:21:52	g	153	4912			so IY go three inches straight
1:23:25	1:23:25	g	29	5005			a little bit too
1:25:8	1:25:15	g	94	5115			ok IY plane crash isn t there
1:26:30	1:26:37	g	228	5197			and there s a plane crash
1:26:49	1:26:51	g	274	5211			ok well
1:26:48	1:26:54	f	198	5214			up tp the right

1:28:58	1:29:4	g	75	5344			about like
1:29:38	1:29:40	g	2	5380			no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
1:30:29	1:30:37	g	9	5437			and IY re going straight up
1:31:47	1:31:48	g	199	5508			after the circle
1:32:40	1:32:45	f	251	5565			elephants 
1:35:45	1:35:53	g	217	5753			and

1:49:51	1:49:54	f	160	6594			IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
1:50:27	1:50:28	g	267	6628			and it slopes a little bit to the right
1:50:36	1:50:45	g	295	6645			and IY go down IY slope to the right
1:51:19	1:51:28	f	334	6688			ok
1:51:39	1:51:41	g	98	6701			ok
1:51:54	1:52:1	g	40	6721			that s IY little slope
1:53:47	1:53:56	g	184	6836			they re there
1:55:18	1:55:19	g	21	6919			and then
1:55:28	1:55:32	g	293	6932			on IY sheet anyway
1:57:39	1:57:42	f	205	7062			IY m three inches above the savannah
1:59:54	2:0:2	g	19	7202			and then IY slope up
2:2:50	2:2:59	g	138	7379			IY wanna kind of curve
2:4:58	2:5:6	g	24	7506			like IY re sloping
2:5:28	2:5:30	g	119	7530			so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
2:5:40	2:5:42	g	181	7542			uhm
2:7:13	2:7:14	f	32	7634			IY hit some round rocks
2:7:23	2:7:23	g	103	7643			yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
2:7:48	2:7:55	f	339	7675			mm hmm
2:8:5	2:8:7	g	342	7687			uhm
2:8:56	2:8:56	g	277	7736			for like

2:14:28	2:14:31	g	70	8071			and then IY are
2:14:39	2:14:45	g	320	8085			and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
2:14:52	2:14:58	f	168	8098			mm hmm
2:19:1	2:19:10	g	15	8350			alright alright well just
2:19:31	2:19:35	f	169	8375			so IY pass a waterhole or no 
2:20:20	2:20:22	g	257	8422			to the white mountain
2:20:18	2:20:25	g	129	8425			to the left
2:22:4	2:22:11	g	66	8531			uhm
2:23:22	2:23:27	f	301	8607			to 
2:26:24	2:26:32	g	289	8792			IY move to the left
2:26:44	2:26:45	g	77	8805			is the plane crash  
2:27:44	2:27:53	g	327	8873			and IY re sloping to the left
2:28:15	2:28:22	g	133	8902			uhm
2:30:0	2:30:3	f	323	9003			ok
2:30:6	2:30:13	f	284	9013			IY know IY have different things so
2:30:48	2:30:56	f	112	9056			yeah IY see that
2:33:34	2:33:42	f	269	9222			nope IY have a white mountain
2:33:58	2:34:6	g	151	9246			like maybe an inch
2:34:44	2:34:49	f	325	9289			IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
2:36:40	2:36:41	g	279	9401			three inches
2:36:41	2:36:49	g	13	9409			yes
2:37:25	2:37:26	g	68	9446			ok
2:38:20	2:38:29	f	150	9509			but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
2:39:3	2:39:8	g	337	9548			it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
2:40:27	2:40:33	f	221	9633			ok
2:40:37	2:40:40	g	256	9640			well
2:40:42	2:40:49	g	123	9649			then
2:41:31	2:41:35	g	3	9695			alright 
2:43:4	2:43:13	g	249	9793			the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
2:43:46	2:43:51	g	42	9831			and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
2:44:8	2:44:10	g	76	9850			yes
2:44:37	2:44:39	g	237	9879			and then
2:45:40	2:45:44	g	314	9944			ok
2:48:13	2:48:19	g	307	10099			are IY anywere near there 
2:49:41	2:49:46	f	212	10186			ok
2:51:39	2:51:48	f	242	10308			and
2:52:12	2:52:12	f	164	10332			and curve down to the left 
2:54:5	2:54:8	f	96	10448			ok
2:54:52	2:55:1	g	74	10501			it s not a big curve
2:55:9	2:55:18	g	67	10518			are IY  
2:56:49	2:56:50	f	294	10610			ok
2:58:51	2:58:52	g	191	10732			like
2:59:16	2:59:18	g	73	10758			couple inches IY re sloping down
2:59:40	2:59:44	g	176	10784			and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
3:1:14	3:1:14	g	286	10874			in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
3:1:13	3:1:21	f	10	10881			ok
3:1:58	3:2:2	g	145	10922			just do it like this ok
3:4:7	3:4:8	g	333	11048			but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
3:5:33	3:5:38	g	186	11138			to the left
3:5:51	3:5:58	f	310	11158			ok
3:6:42	3:6:50	g	262	11210			like
3:8:12	3:8:13	g	285	11293			maybe four inches on the paper
3:8:43	3:8:48	g	124	11328			so
3:10:19	3:10:24	g	189	11424			to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
3:11:35	3:11:43	g	321	11503			ok
3:12:18	3:12:26	g	87	11546			that s about five or six inches
3:13:27	3:13:29	g	65	11609			and then
3:15:20	3:15:23	g	34	11723			so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
3:15:46	3:15:47	g	22	11747			IY re kind of going  
3:17:6	3:17:9	g	305	11829			uhm
3:21:33	3:21:38	g	193	12098			are IY anywhere near there 
3:25:18	3:25:18	g	282	12318			and then IY slope down to the left
3:25:50	3:25:54	f	41	12354			do IY go around it 
3:26:6	3:26:12	g	174	12372			like an inch
3:26:52	3:27:0	g	300	12420			uhm
3:27:30	3:27:35	g	12	12455			uh like
3:28:16	3:28:24	g	38	12504			like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
3:28:53	3:29:0	f	233	12540			IY have to back up a little bit
3:30:47	3:30:48	g	30	12648			and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
3:33:33	3:33:33	g	317	12813			now IY re at the collapsed shelter
3:34:44	3:34:45	g	306	12885			as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
3:35:25	3:35:31	g	149	12931			and then IY slope
3:35:58	3:36:2	g	156	12962			maybe
3:37:9	3:37:10	f	99	13030			and there s a collapsed shelter
3:37:12	3:37:20	g	211	13040			IY make
3:38:27	3:38:36	g	258	13116			what 
3:38:56	3:39:2	g	319	13142			ok
3:39:55	3:40:0	g	31	13200			right next to IY circle should be roman baths
3:39:55	3:40:4	g	230	13204			where IY re going down to a plane crash
3:41:49	3:41:54	f	232	13314			IY hit some rocks though
3:42:21	3:42:21	g	139	13341			IY have a waterhole on IY map 
3:43:11	3:43:18	f	25	13398			yeah
3:44:10	3:44:11	g	213	13451			IY plane crash 
3:44:8	3:44:13	g	27	13453			IY don t know
3:44:29	3:44:30	g	272	13470			couple miles or something
3:45:9	3:45:13	g	33	13513			uhm
3:46:38	3:46:38	g	54	13598			just a slight slope
3:46:56	3:47:0	g	4	13620			IY go straight down
3:47:53	3:47:56	g	328	13676			so IY make that circle
3:48:58	3:49:4	g	148	13744			uhm
3:50:29	3:50:29	g	240	13829			uhm
3:54:20	3:54:22	g	47	14062			well just
3:54:46	3:54:52	g	248	14092			but
3:55:37	3:55:40	g	252	14140			ok IY re at the savannah
3:55:37	3:55:46	f	45	14146			yeah
3:56:14	3:56:14	g	104	14174			a quarter of an inch
3:56:17	3:56:21	g	324	14181			and then
3:57:33	3:57:34	f	172	14254			yeah
3:59:14	3:59:18	g	299	14358			after plane crash
3:59:40	3:59:48	f	250	14388			around the lake to the top 
4:3:1	4:3:4	f	132	14584			ok
4:4:43	4:4:47	g	170	14687			like three inches 
4:5:11	4:5:12	g	183	14712			ok
4:5:8	4:5:16	f	163	14716			how many inches do IY think 
4:6:8	4:6:12	g	111	14772			slight
4:7:26	4:7:34	f	266	14854			so IY go to the left of the antelope
4:9:7	4:9:11	f	313	14951			no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
4:9:31	4:9:40	f	290	14980			ok
4:9:46	4:9:50	g	7	14990			ok
4:10:20	4:10:23	g	131	15023			and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
4:11:46	4:11:51	g	130	15111			and IY should have a straight line there
4:12:54	4:12:54	g	271	15174			and then
4:12:56	4:13:4	g	100	15184			ok
4:14:22	4:14:27	g	121	15267			from
4:17:29	4:17:29	g	101	15449			ok
4:19:17	4:19:21	g	125	15561			uhm
4:22:50	4:22:51	g	152	15771			uhm
4:26:33	4:26:36	g	218	15996			ok
4:27:24	4:27:29	g	6	16049			ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
4:29:59	4:30:1	f	273	16201			IY go to a lake 
4:30:12	4:30:16	g	55	16216			and is to the left
4:30:58	4:31:7	f	204	16267			so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right
