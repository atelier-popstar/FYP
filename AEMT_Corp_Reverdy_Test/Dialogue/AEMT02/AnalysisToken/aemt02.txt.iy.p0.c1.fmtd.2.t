start
start g
1	0:1:3	0:1:10	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
2	0:1:40	0:1:45	and then IY go straight
3	0:2:6	0:2:8	and then
5	0:4:11	0:4:14	uhm
6	0:7:53	0:7:53	ok
7	0:8:14	0:8:16	ok
8	0:8:27	0:8:35	yes
9	0:10:42	0:10:51	uhm
10	0:10:53	0:10:56	and 
11	0:12:30	0:12:33	uhm
13	0:13:22	0:13:27	yes IY re going towards the lake
14	0:15:10	0:15:12	go up like three  three and a half inches
15	0:15:11	0:15:13	are IY in like   
16	0:16:13	0:16:22	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
17	0:16:29	0:16:34	ok
19	0:17:4	0:17:13	and then
20	0:18:43	0:18:48	and there s a plane crash
21	0:21:11	0:21:18	after that IY go straight again
22	0:22:11	0:22:16	a little bit too
24	0:25:38	0:25:41	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
27	0:33:21	0:33:22	like an inch
28	0:33:22	0:33:26	ok
29	0:33:31	0:33:35	for like
31	0:33:38	0:33:47	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
32	0:33:59	0:34:5	and then IY ll come to a savannah
33	0:35:38	0:35:39	ok well
34	0:37:30	0:37:34	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
35	0:37:38	0:37:45	and IY slope is about an inch long
37	0:38:55	0:38:56	have a s 
38	0:39:2	0:39:3	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
39	0:40:30	0:40:33	and IY should have a straight line there
42	0:42:29	0:42:38	ok
43	0:42:50	0:42:57	do IY have roman baths 
44	0:44:6	0:44:10	ok
45	0:44:24	0:44:27	to the left
46	0:45:8	0:45:12	after IY slope down IY d say
47	0:48:43	0:48:50	what 
48	0:49:25	0:49:25	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
49	0:50:18	0:50:22	just a slight slope
50	0:51:15	0:51:21	and then
51	0:51:39	0:51:48	five
55	0:55:17	0:55:22	is the plane crash  
56	0:57:58	0:58:5	and it slopes a little bit to the right
57	0:58:9	0:58:11	ok
59	0:58:21	0:58:29	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
61	1:0:10	1:0:17	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
62	1:1:48	1:1:56	ok IY re at the savannah
63	1:7:38	1:7:44	ok
64	1:8:10	1:8:15	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
66	1:11:45	1:11:45	IY got that 
67	1:13:11	1:13:16	uhm
69	1:16:25	1:16:32	IY just kind of slope down
70	1:17:14	1:17:21	a little
71	1:19:18	1:19:18	ok
73	1:20:36	1:20:41	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
74	1:20:58	1:20:58	so that s about IY would say
76	1:22:8	1:22:11	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
77	1:22:57	1:23:0	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
78	1:23:6	1:23:12	uhm
80	1:26:34	1:26:39	IY go straight down
81	1:28:46	1:28:49	IY re kind of going  
82	1:29:2	1:29:9	that s about five or six inches
83	1:29:55	1:29:56	IY move to the left
84	1:32:0	1:32:9	ok
85	1:35:5	1:35:6	to the right
87	1:38:29	1:38:34	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
88	1:38:41	1:38:49	four or five inches to the left
90	1:42:15	1:42:18	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
91	1:43:12	1:43:15	alright 
95	1:45:29	1:45:37	and IY just go straight up
97	1:47:19	1:47:22	like four or five inches to the left
98	1:48:14	1:48:15	and IY go down IY slope to the right
100	1:48:47	1:48:56	ok
101	1:49:30	1:49:32	ok and then IY re going
103	1:52:55	1:52:57	there s a there s  
104	1:54:26	1:54:28	straight up
106	1:59:58	1:59:59	uhm
107	2:1:51	2:1:53	uhm
108	2:1:46	2:1:55	to the left
110	2:4:50	2:4:50	so anyway
112	2:5:52	2:6:0	and then IY slope up
113	2:6:51	2:6:54	three inches
114	2:8:24	2:8:31	IY plane crash 
115	2:9:1	2:9:1	three inches
116	2:9:11	2:9:11	like
117	2:9:28	2:9:36	after plane crash
118	2:10:17	2:10:20	it s not a big curve
119	2:10:42	2:10:51	are IY in like almost the top of the
120	2:12:34	2:12:34	to the lake 
121	2:12:58	2:13:6	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
122	2:13:12	2:13:12	maybe like
124	2:15:57	2:16:6	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
126	2:24:21	2:24:29	and IY re going straight up
127	2:24:51	2:24:51	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
129	2:26:0	2:26:9	are IY  
132	2:29:9	2:29:15	ok
134	2:32:58	2:33:5	like IY re sloping
135	2:37:10	2:37:17	and that s where the plane crash is
136	2:37:28	2:37:35	kind of across from stony desert
137	2:41:23	2:41:23	it s right next to it
138	2:42:3	2:42:10	IY re sloping
140	2:42:54	2:42:56	and IY re going up like
141	2:42:47	2:42:56	ok
142	2:44:18	2:44:20	well
143	2:44:48	2:44:57	not right at the stony desert
145	2:50:33	2:50:41	no IY have  
146	2:50:38	2:50:46	just do it like this ok
147	2:50:43	2:50:48	maybe IY have different things
149	2:58:33	2:58:40	no IY don t have a waterhole
151	3:0:9	3:0:17	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
152	3:0:15	3:0:18	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
153	3:1:53	3:2:0	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
154	3:2:21	3:2:23	so IY re at the hot springs
155	3:3:21	3:3:30	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
157	3:4:12	3:4:20	the slate mountain is towards the right
158	3:10:16	3:10:21	a quarter of an inch
159	3:11:33	3:11:34	an inch maybe a little bit less
160	3:14:3	3:14:9	and IY re sloping to the left
161	3:14:8	3:14:10	like
163	3:17:4	3:17:10	slight
164	3:20:47	3:20:51	uhm
165	3:21:14	3:21:23	alright well IY ll keep going and see
166	3:23:47	3:23:51	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
167	3:24:10	3:24:17	no there s no elephants
170	3:26:31	3:26:34	couple inches IY re sloping down
171	3:27:40	3:27:47	like three inches 
172	3:29:6	3:29:12	ok
173	3:29:29	3:29:32	uhm
174	3:30:50	3:30:57	and then IY slope
175	3:32:52	3:33:1	IY make
176	3:36:18	3:36:18	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
180	3:43:5	3:43:10	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
181	3:44:8	3:44:10	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
182	3:44:40	3:44:41	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
183	3:47:0	3:47:2	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
186	3:51:50	3:51:50	probably the same thing
187	3:53:13	3:53:16	uhm
189	3:56:31	3:56:31	are IY anywhere near there 
190	3:57:26	3:57:32	from
192	3:58:35	3:58:44	and
193	3:59:33	3:59:35	ok well
194	4:0:32	4:0:33	and then
195	4:2:24	4:2:24	and 
196	4:6:26	4:6:31	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
198	4:7:27	4:7:32	ok
199	4:9:58	4:9:58	and then IY go
202	4:14:42	4:14:50	uhm
203	4:16:44	4:16:49	like
208	4:22:7	4:22:16	like maybe an inch
209	4:22:42	4:22:45	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
210	4:22:59	4:23:7	IY re at the plane crash
213	4:26:5	4:26:13	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
215	4:28:34	4:28:43	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
217	4:29:58	4:30:5	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
218	4:31:15	4:31:20	no
219	4:32:6	4:32:6	uhm
220	4:32:48	4:32:56	ok
221	4:35:9	4:35:14	they re there
222	4:36:43	4:36:47	are IY anywere near there 
223	4:37:18	4:37:26	and then
224	4:38:51	4:38:51	ok
225	4:40:21	4:40:30	for about two inches
226	4:41:11	4:41:19	for like
227	4:41:38	4:41:38	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
228	4:41:34	4:41:43	alright 
229	4:42:52	4:42:54	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
230	4:44:48	4:44:56	and IY re going
232	4:45:58	4:46:5	IY re starting
233	4:46:33	4:46:33	uhm
236	4:49:18	4:49:23	around the bottom of it
237	4:49:20	4:49:23	ok
238	4:51:18	4:51:18	and then
239	4:52:13	4:52:14	where IY re going down to a plane crash
240	4:54:35	4:54:38	IY slope down again
241	4:54:33	4:54:39	to the white mountain
242	4:55:5	4:55:5	hmm
243	4:56:15	4:56:24	but
244	4:56:41	4:56:49	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
245	4:57:20	4:57:22	IY re starting at the stony desert
246	4:59:25	4:59:30	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
247	5:0:21	5:0:23	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
248	5:2:46	5:2:49	and is to the left
249	5:3:46	5:3:46	maybe four inches on the paper
250	5:4:43	5:4:51	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
253	5:8:17	5:8:25	then
254	5:9:23	5:9:29	IY would say
255	5:9:56	5:10:2	to IY right 
258	5:14:7	5:14:9	three inches straight across
260	5:15:41	5:15:48	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
264	5:19:26	5:19:26	and
266	5:23:46	5:23:49	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
269	5:24:54	5:24:54	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
270	5:26:51	5:26:52	well
271	5:27:24	5:27:33	and then IY re going down
273	5:29:32	5:29:41	and then IY slope down to the left
275	5:35:4	5:35:13	IY re just going down
278	5:38:45	5:38:48	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
279	5:38:58	5:39:3	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
280	5:39:48	5:39:53	IY wanna kind of curve
282	5:41:2	5:41:3	ok 
284	5:45:39	5:45:44	no IY don t have any rocks
285	5:45:45	5:45:53	you
286	5:53:0	5:53:6	ok
287	5:54:29	5:54:30	so IY go three inches straight
288	5:55:34	5:55:36	like
289	6:0:54	6:1:2	well just
290	6:2:22	6:2:24	on IY sheet anyway

297	6:5:42	6:5:45	IY re going about
298	6:5:53	6:5:53	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
300	6:9:29	6:9:36	ok
301	6:10:16	6:10:18	ok IY plane crash isn t there
302	6:10:26	6:10:35	well alright
303	6:11:1	6:11:5	uhm
304	6:11:23	6:11:32	yes
305	6:11:46	6:11:46	and IY go to the left a little bit
307	6:16:2	6:16:5	after the circle
308	6:18:5	6:18:5	uhm and there is a stony desert
310	6:20:47	6:20:56	ok
311	6:22:4	6:22:7	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there

330	6:45:26	6:45:33	what 
332	6:47:49	6:47:54	that s IY little slope
333	6:49:2	6:49:8	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
335	6:51:7	6:51:11	so IY make that circle
336	6:51:6	6:51:14	uhhh no
337	6:51:34	6:51:38	and then IY are

177	3:36:28	3:36:30	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
178	3:40:23	3:40:26	to the left
179	3:40:47	3:40:47	ok
184	3:47:49	3:47:49	ok
185	3:49:45	3:49:48	IY hit some rocks though

191	3:58:34	3:58:42	ok
197	4:6:57	4:7:0	IY ve a plane crash though
200	4:12:58	4:12:59	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
201	4:13:29	4:13:38	ok
204	4:18:6	4:18:9	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
205	4:19:6	4:19:11	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
206	4:20:23	4:20:28	ok
207	4:20:29	4:20:30	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
211	4:23:50	4:23:51	ok
212	4:24:39	4:24:39	yeah
214	4:27:51	4:27:53	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
216	4:29:3	4:29:8	mm  mm
231	4:45:35	4:45:38	to the right 
234	4:47:14	4:47:17	IY have to back up a little bit
235	4:47:15	4:47:23	ok

252	5:6:43	5:6:47	ok
256	5:11:53	5:11:57	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
257	5:12:56	5:13:3	yeah and IY went straight up
259	5:15:6	5:15:15	ok
261	5:15:42	5:15:49	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
262	5:16:15	5:16:22	uh IY don t know know what to say
263	5:16:19	5:16:24	ok
265	5:22:14	5:22:18	nope IY have a white mountain
267	5:24:18	5:24:18	IY hit some round rocks
268	5:24:40	5:24:48	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
272	5:28:44	5:28:51	ok
274	5:32:25	5:32:32	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
276	5:35:21	5:35:22	ok
277	5:37:47	5:37:50	how many inches do IY think 
281	5:40:46	5:40:49	elephants 
283	5:42:57	5:43:0	do IY go by the plane crash 
299	6:8:49	6:8:58	around the top of the lake 
306	6:12:23	6:12:25	up tp the right
309	6:19:25	6:19:33	IY know IY have different things so
312	6:23:3	6:23:8	ok
313	6:26:1	6:26:2	to 
319	6:35:8	6:35:17	 IY m at the savannah
328	6:42:39	6:42:47	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
329	6:42:54	6:42:54	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
331	6:46:47	6:46:49	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
334	6:49:0	6:49:8	mm hmm
start g
1	0:1:3	0:1:10	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
2	0:1:40	0:1:45	and then IY go straight
3	0:2:6	0:2:8	and then
5	0:4:11	0:4:14	uhm

14	0:15:10	0:15:12	go up like three  three and a half inches
15	0:15:11	0:15:13	are IY in like   
16	0:16:13	0:16:22	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
17	0:16:29	0:16:34	ok
19	0:17:4	0:17:13	and then
20	0:18:43	0:18:48	and there s a plane crash
21	0:21:11	0:21:18	after that IY go straight again
22	0:22:11	0:22:16	a little bit too
24	0:25:38	0:25:41	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
27	0:33:21	0:33:22	like an inch
28	0:33:22	0:33:26	ok
29	0:33:31	0:33:35	for like
31	0:33:38	0:33:47	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
32	0:33:59	0:34:5	and then IY ll come to a savannah
33	0:35:38	0:35:39	ok well
34	0:37:30	0:37:34	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
35	0:37:38	0:37:45	and IY slope is about an inch long
37	0:38:55	0:38:56	have a s 
38	0:39:2	0:39:3	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
39	0:40:30	0:40:33	and IY should have a straight line there
42	0:42:29	0:42:38	ok
43	0:42:50	0:42:57	do IY have roman baths 
44	0:44:6	0:44:10	ok
45	0:44:24	0:44:27	to the left
46	0:45:8	0:45:12	after IY slope down IY d say
47	0:48:43	0:48:50	what 
48	0:49:25	0:49:25	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
49	0:50:18	0:50:22	just a slight slope
50	0:51:15	0:51:21	and then
51	0:51:39	0:51:48	five
55	0:55:17	0:55:22	is the plane crash  
56	0:57:58	0:58:5	and it slopes a little bit to the right
57	0:58:9	0:58:11	ok
59	0:58:21	0:58:29	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
61	1:0:10	1:0:17	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
62	1:1:48	1:1:56	ok IY re at the savannah
63	1:7:38	1:7:44	ok
64	1:8:10	1:8:15	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
66	1:11:45	1:11:45	IY got that 
67	1:13:11	1:13:16	uhm
69	1:16:25	1:16:32	IY just kind of slope down

71	1:19:18	1:19:18	ok
73	1:20:36	1:20:41	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
74	1:20:58	1:20:58	so that s about IY would say
76	1:22:8	1:22:11	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
77	1:22:57	1:23:0	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
78	1:23:6	1:23:12	uhm
80	1:26:34	1:26:39	IY go straight down
81	1:28:46	1:28:49	IY re kind of going  
82	1:29:2	1:29:9	that s about five or six inches
83	1:29:55	1:29:56	IY move to the left
84	1:32:0	1:32:9	ok
85	1:35:5	1:35:6	to the right
87	1:38:29	1:38:34	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
88	1:38:41	1:38:49	four or five inches to the left
90	1:42:15	1:42:18	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
91	1:43:12	1:43:15	alright 
95	1:45:29	1:45:37	and IY just go straight up
97	1:47:19	1:47:22	like four or five inches to the left
98	1:48:14	1:48:15	and IY go down IY slope to the right
100	1:48:47	1:48:56	ok
101	1:49:30	1:49:32	ok and then IY re going
103	1:52:55	1:52:57	there s a there s  
104	1:54:26	1:54:28	straight up
106	1:59:58	1:59:59	uhm
107	2:1:51	2:1:53	uhm
108	2:1:46	2:1:55	to the left
110	2:4:50	2:4:50	so anyway
112	2:5:52	2:6:0	and then IY slope up
113	2:6:51	2:6:54	three inches
114	2:8:24	2:8:31	IY plane crash 
115	2:9:1	2:9:1	three inches
116	2:9:11	2:9:11	like
117	2:9:28	2:9:36	after plane crash
118	2:10:17	2:10:20	it s not a big curve
119	2:10:42	2:10:51	are IY in like almost the top of the
120	2:12:34	2:12:34	to the lake 
121	2:12:58	2:13:6	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
122	2:13:12	2:13:12	maybe like
124	2:15:57	2:16:6	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
126	2:24:21	2:24:29	and IY re going straight up
127	2:24:51	2:24:51	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
129	2:26:0	2:26:9	are IY  
132	2:29:9	2:29:15	ok
134	2:32:58	2:33:5	like IY re sloping
135	2:37:10	2:37:17	and that s where the plane crash is
136	2:37:28	2:37:35	kind of across from stony desert
137	2:41:23	2:41:23	it s right next to it
138	2:42:3	2:42:10	IY re sloping
140	2:42:54	2:42:56	and IY re going up like
141	2:42:47	2:42:56	ok
142	2:44:18	2:44:20	well
143	2:44:48	2:44:57	not right at the stony desert
145	2:50:33	2:50:41	no IY have  
146	2:50:38	2:50:46	just do it like this ok
147	2:50:43	2:50:48	maybe IY have different things
149	2:58:33	2:58:40	no IY don t have a waterhole
151	3:0:9	3:0:17	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
152	3:0:15	3:0:18	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
153	3:1:53	3:2:0	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
154	3:2:21	3:2:23	so IY re at the hot springs
155	3:3:21	3:3:30	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
157	3:4:12	3:4:20	the slate mountain is towards the right
158	3:10:16	3:10:21	a quarter of an inch
159	3:11:33	3:11:34	an inch maybe a little bit less
160	3:14:3	3:14:9	and IY re sloping to the left
161	3:14:8	3:14:10	like
163	3:17:4	3:17:10	slight
164	3:20:47	3:20:51	uhm
165	3:21:14	3:21:23	alright well IY ll keep going and see
166	3:23:47	3:23:51	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
167	3:24:10	3:24:17	no there s no elephants
170	3:26:31	3:26:34	couple inches IY re sloping down
171	3:27:40	3:27:47	like three inches 
172	3:29:6	3:29:12	ok
173	3:29:29	3:29:32	uhm
174	3:30:50	3:30:57	and then IY slope
175	3:32:52	3:33:1	IY make
176	3:36:18	3:36:18	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
180	3:43:5	3:43:10	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
181	3:44:8	3:44:10	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
182	3:44:40	3:44:41	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
183	3:47:0	3:47:2	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
186	3:51:50	3:51:50	probably the same thing
187	3:53:13	3:53:16	uhm
189	3:56:31	3:56:31	are IY anywhere near there 
190	3:57:26	3:57:32	from

208	4:22:7	4:22:16	like maybe an inch
209	4:22:42	4:22:45	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
210	4:22:59	4:23:7	IY re at the plane crash
213	4:26:5	4:26:13	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
215	4:28:34	4:28:43	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
217	4:29:58	4:30:5	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
218	4:31:15	4:31:20	no
219	4:32:6	4:32:6	uhm
220	4:32:48	4:32:56	ok

224	4:38:51	4:38:51	ok
225	4:40:21	4:40:30	for about two inches
226	4:41:11	4:41:19	for like
227	4:41:38	4:41:38	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
228	4:41:34	4:41:43	alright 
229	4:42:52	4:42:54	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
230	4:44:48	4:44:56	and IY re going
232	4:45:58	4:46:5	IY re starting
233	4:46:33	4:46:33	uhm
236	4:49:18	4:49:23	around the bottom of it
237	4:49:20	4:49:23	ok
238	4:51:18	4:51:18	and then
239	4:52:13	4:52:14	where IY re going down to a plane crash
240	4:54:35	4:54:38	IY slope down again
241	4:54:33	4:54:39	to the white mountain
242	4:55:5	4:55:5	hmm
243	4:56:15	4:56:24	but
244	4:56:41	4:56:49	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
245	4:57:20	4:57:22	IY re starting at the stony desert
246	4:59:25	4:59:30	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
247	5:0:21	5:0:23	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
248	5:2:46	5:2:49	and is to the left
249	5:3:46	5:3:46	maybe four inches on the paper
250	5:4:43	5:4:51	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
253	5:8:17	5:8:25	then
254	5:9:23	5:9:29	IY would say
255	5:9:56	5:10:2	to IY right 
258	5:14:7	5:14:9	three inches straight across
260	5:15:41	5:15:48	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
264	5:19:26	5:19:26	and
266	5:23:46	5:23:49	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
269	5:24:54	5:24:54	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
270	5:26:51	5:26:52	well
271	5:27:24	5:27:33	and then IY re going down
273	5:29:32	5:29:41	and then IY slope down to the left
275	5:35:4	5:35:13	IY re just going down
278	5:38:45	5:38:48	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
279	5:38:58	5:39:3	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
280	5:39:48	5:39:53	IY wanna kind of curve
282	5:41:2	5:41:3	ok 
284	5:45:39	5:45:44	no IY don t have any rocks

297	6:5:42	6:5:45	IY re going about
298	6:5:53	6:5:53	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
300	6:9:29	6:9:36	ok
301	6:10:16	6:10:18	ok IY plane crash isn t there
302	6:10:26	6:10:35	well alright
303	6:11:1	6:11:5	uhm
304	6:11:23	6:11:32	yes
