start
0:0:48	0:0:56	g	ok
0:1:2	0:1:5	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
0:1:19	0:1:22	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
0:1:44	0:1:51	g	well
0:3:8	0:3:13	f	ok
0:3:46	0:3:48	f	ok
0:4:20	0:4:22	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
0:4:39	0:4:44	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
0:4:36	0:4:44	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
0:7:3	0:7:12	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
0:11:11	0:11:19	g	uhm
0:12:19	0:12:19	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
0:12:26	0:12:29	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
0:13:28	0:13:37	g	ok IY re at the savannah
0:15:2	0:15:3	f	do IY go through anything 
0:15:5	0:15:14	g	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
0:15:22	0:15:30	g	to the left
0:18:26	0:18:27	g	it s not a big curve
0:19:24	0:19:26	g	IY re starting at the stony desert
0:19:24	0:19:27	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
0:19:59	0:20:1	g	like
0:22:27	0:22:32	g	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
0:25:10	0:25:15	f	ok
0:25:57	0:25:58	f	ok
0:26:55	0:26:58	g	and then
0:28:44	0:28:51	g	maybe
0:30:48	0:30:53	g	no IY have  
0:32:3	0:32:7	g	are IY  
0:32:36	0:32:44	f	and then what 
0:34:40	0:34:48	f	nope IY have a white mountain
0:35:29	0:35:38	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
0:35:52	0:35:56	g	that s about five or six inches
0:36:55	0:36:56	g	no IY don t have a waterhole
0:36:55	0:37:1	g	uhm
0:37:1	0:37:8	f	yeah IY see that
0:37:12	0:37:17	g	to IY right 
0:37:42	0:37:43	f	ok
0:40:35	0:40:36	g	ok
0:41:10	0:41:11	g	so IY make that circle
0:44:30	0:44:31	g	slight
0:44:34	0:44:43	g	so IY go three inches straight
0:44:53	0:44:54	g	they re there
0:45:7	0:45:14	g	an inch maybe a little bit less
0:46:9	0:46:12	g	ok
0:47:40	0:47:42	g	ok
0:51:51	0:51:58	g	and then
0:55:7	0:55:10	f	IY hit some round rocks
0:55:39	0:55:46	g	well just
0:59:33	0:59:34	f	ok
1:1:2	1:1:4	g	four or five inches to the left
1:2:5	1:2:5	f	mm hmm
1:2:19	1:2:22	f	 IY m at the savannah
1:2:32	1:2:36	g	ok
1:3:13	1:3:18	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
1:5:25	1:5:31	f	ok
1:9:2	1:9:3	g	and then
1:9:34	1:9:36	g	and then IY go straight
1:9:54	1:9:58	g	uhm
1:10:1	1:10:7	f	around the top of the lake 
1:11:58	1:12:6	g	IY re sloping
1:12:55	1:13:2	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
1:13:14	1:13:18	g	ok
1:13:27	1:13:30	g	after that IY go straight again
1:15:19	1:15:24	f	ok
1:15:21	1:15:27	g	three inches
1:16:5	1:16:11	f	and curve down to the left 
1:19:22	1:19:27	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
1:19:29	1:19:30	g	like an inch
1:21:24	1:21:28	g	there s a there s  
1:23:50	1:23:57	f	to 
1:24:19	1:24:22	f	IY ve a plane crash though
1:25:33	1:25:35	f	elephants 
1:26:12	1:26:19	g	and then
1:26:49	1:26:56	f	ok
1:27:45	1:27:50	g	ok
1:28:21	1:28:22	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
1:29:43	1:29:46	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
1:30:56	1:30:59	g	no
1:31:50	1:31:55	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
1:32:51	1:32:59	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
1:33:44	1:33:52	g	IY wanna kind of curve
1:35:47	1:35:47	g	and IY just go straight up
1:36:16	1:36:23	g	just a slight slope
1:36:18	1:36:27	f	ok
1:36:30	1:36:32	g	uhm
1:37:44	1:37:53	g	and then
1:38:30	1:38:35	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
1:39:22	1:39:31	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
1:40:27	1:40:28	g	not right at the stony desert
1:46:1	1:46:2	g	IY re actually starting like right
1:46:19	1:46:19	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
1:46:29	1:46:38	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
1:46:31	1:46:40	g	ok
1:46:46	1:46:52	g	about like
1:47:46	1:47:48	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
1:48:24	1:48:31	g	and then
1:51:45	1:51:50	g	yes
1:52:2	1:52:8	g	from
1:53:45	1:53:50	g	ok well
1:55:36	1:55:39	g	maybe like
1:57:11	1:57:13	g	uhm
1:57:56	1:58:3	g	ok
2:3:10	2:3:12	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
2:4:6	2:4:9	g	IY re going about
2:4:13	2:4:22	g	maybe IY have different things
2:5:48	2:5:48	g	maybe four inches on the paper
2:6:15	2:6:19	g	so that s about IY would say
2:6:52	2:7:0	g	and IY re going straight up
2:9:1	2:9:6	g	like four or five inches to the left
2:9:36	2:9:44	f	mm hmm
2:9:49	2:9:54	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
2:10:36	2:10:40	g	for about two inches
2:10:43	2:10:47	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
2:11:16	2:11:18	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
2:12:1	2:12:9	g	yes
2:13:1	2:13:4	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
2:14:15	2:14:22	g	the  
2:15:32	2:15:39	g	so IY re at the hot springs
2:15:43	2:15:50	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
2:16:33	2:16:36	f	yeah
2:18:9	2:18:15	f	around the lake to the top 
2:19:44	2:19:45	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
2:20:16	2:20:22	g	IY make
2:21:57	2:22:5	f	mm hmm
2:22:40	2:22:41	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
2:24:4	2:24:6	f	ok
2:24:57	2:25:0	g	hmm
2:25:34	2:25:40	g	like
2:28:3	2:28:12	f	ok
2:28:41	2:28:48	f	ok
2:30:8	2:30:14	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
2:30:47	2:30:50	g	yes IY re going towards the lake
2:30:51	2:30:53	g	uhm
2:32:52	2:32:59	g	IY plane crash 
2:34:47	2:34:48	g	uhm
2:36:19	2:36:27	g	so
2:36:44	2:36:47	g	no
2:38:7	2:38:13	g	to the left
2:38:22	2:38:31	g	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
2:38:57	2:38:58	g	well
2:38:59	2:39:5	g	like IY re sloping
2:39:6	2:39:14	g	what 
2:39:30	2:39:36	f	so wait
2:39:55	2:40:4	g	for like
2:40:38	2:40:45	g	ok
2:41:36	2:41:36	f	IY know IY have different things so
2:41:45	2:41:54	f	ok
2:44:5	2:44:7	g	ok well
2:44:4	2:44:13	g	a little
2:44:51	2:44:52	f	how many inches do IY think 
2:45:7	2:45:8	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
2:45:32	2:45:33	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
2:46:51	2:46:51	g	have a s 
2:48:7	2:48:12	g	alright alright well just
2:48:35	2:48:36	f	mm hmm
2:49:44	2:49:46	g	uhm
2:51:26	2:51:35	g	after plane crash
2:52:40	2:52:42	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
2:55:24	2:55:32	g	uhhh no
2:55:51	2:55:57	g	and then IY slope up
2:58:9	2:58:16	g	and then
2:59:9	2:59:13	g	like maybe an inch
3:1:59	3:2:4	g	IY would say
3:2:11	3:2:16	f	yep
3:2:26	3:2:34	g	do IY have roman baths 
3:5:15	3:5:23	g	three inches straight across
3:5:46	3:5:52	g	ok
3:7:4	3:7:10	g	uhm
3:9:22	3:9:24	g	IY re going like
3:9:45	3:9:46	f	ok
3:10:6	3:10:7	f	yeah
3:10:11	3:10:14	g	a quarter of an inch
3:10:19	3:10:26	g	ok
3:12:22	3:12:28	f	and to the right 
3:13:7	3:13:10	g	but
3:13:33	3:13:36	g	ok
3:14:30	3:14:30	f	mm hmm
3:14:43	3:14:43	g	and that s where the plane crash is
3:14:49	3:14:52	g	and is to the left
3:15:48	3:15:54	g	uhm
3:15:55	3:16:1	g	and
3:16:52	3:16:55	f	ok

3:20:38	3:20:45	f	nope
3:21:6	3:21:11	g	after the circle
3:23:8	3:23:8	g	it s right next to it
3:23:12	3:23:20	f	ok wait hold on
3:24:52	3:24:58	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
3:25:9	3:25:16	g	for like
3:27:1	3:27:1	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
3:27:11	3:27:13	g	ok
3:27:14	3:27:21	g	and 
3:31:36	3:31:45	g	alright

3:39:15	3:39:15	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
3:40:41	3:40:42	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
3:41:42	3:41:50	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
3:42:10	3:42:12	g	uhm
3:42:42	3:42:47	g	maybe like
3:45:15	3:45:17	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing

3:45:52	3:45:58	f	mm  mm
3:48:19	3:48:28	f	to the left
3:49:28	3:49:28	g	to the left
3:49:56	3:49:58	g	are IY anywere near there 
3:50:4	3:50:13	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
3:52:14	3:52:14	f	uh IY don t know know what to say
3:56:9	3:56:12	g	well alright
3:57:53	3:57:56	g	IY re just going down

4:5:42	4:5:49	g	three inches
4:5:59	4:6:5	g	IY re starting
4:6:19	4:6:25	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
4:7:4	4:7:8	f	ok
4:8:0	4:8:7	g	and then IY slope
4:8:21	4:8:28	g	ok
4:8:29	4:8:32	g	like
4:11:36	4:11:45	g	and IY re going
4:12:21	4:12:23	g	uhm

4:13:45	4:13:47	g	alright 
4:16:18	4:16:26	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
4:19:4	4:19:5	g	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
4:19:44	4:19:47	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
4:20:29	4:20:30	g	uhm
4:22:2	4:22:11	f	yeah 
4:28:42	4:28:42	g	after IY slope down IY d say
4:30:40	4:30:45	g	and then
4:32:9	4:32:14	g	and IY should have a straight line there
4:32:15	4:32:23	g	IY slope down again
4:32:35	4:32:43	f	IY have to back up a little bit
4:33:46	4:33:54	f	ok
4:35:43	4:35:51	g	and there s a plane crash
4:38:13	4:38:21	g	IY re kind of going  
4:38:54	4:39:0	g	and IY re going up like
4:39:12	4:39:14	g	is the plane crash  
4:40:19	4:40:27	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
4:40:42	4:40:49	g	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
4:42:4	4:42:9	g	and then IY  IY go up
4:43:37	4:43:41	f	yeah
4:45:2	4:45:5	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
4:45:25	4:45:26	g	then
4:45:27	4:45:30	f	IY m three inches above the savannah
4:45:47	4:45:49	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
4:49:43	4:49:50	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
4:50:8	4:50:15	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
4:51:25	4:51:27	g	uhm
4:52:23	4:52:31	g	ok
4:52:24	4:52:32	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
4:53:25	4:53:31	f	yeah
4:55:2	4:55:4	f	ok
4:56:33	4:56:41	g	IY got that 
4:56:48	4:56:52	g	ok
4:58:9	4:58:11	g	to the right
4:59:19	4:59:19	g	ok
5:2:58	5:2:58	g	and then IY are
5:5:45	5:5:45	g	IY move to the left
5:7:55	5:7:57	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
5:8:48	5:8:56	g	that s IY little slope
5:9:17	5:9:19	g	ok
5:16:33	5:16:36	g	ok
5:19:47	5:19:48	g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
5:20:52	5:20:59	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
5:21:35	5:21:41	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
5:24:3	5:24:12	g	and 
5:24:15	5:24:17	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
5:24:18	5:24:27	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
5:24:50	5:24:56	g	to the white mountain
5:25:38	5:25:46	g	ok
5:26:59	5:27:7	g	what 
5:27:25	5:27:31	g	straight up
5:27:58	5:28:2	g	and then IY slope down to the left
5:28:51	5:28:55	f	ok
5:33:27	5:33:27	g	kind of across from stony desert
5:33:50	5:33:53	g	and then IY go
5:34:59	5:35:2	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
5:35:45	5:35:50	g	on IY sheet anyway
5:36:47	5:36:50	g	and IY re sloping to the left
5:39:58	5:40:7	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
5:40:52	5:40:55	g	and then IY re going down
5:40:53	5:41:2	g	IY just kind of slope down
5:42:3	5:42:12	g	around the bottom of it
5:42:7	5:42:15	f	to the right 
5:42:34	5:42:43	g	ok
5:43:16	5:43:24	f	mm hmm
5:43:35	5:43:40	g	ok and then IY re going
5:43:41	5:43:47	g	are IY in like   
5:48:21	5:48:24	g	couple miles or something
5:49:46	5:49:49	g	and IY go to the left a little bit
5:49:56	5:50:4	g	are IY anywhere near there 
5:50:30	5:50:36	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
5:51:19	5:51:26	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
5:52:52	5:52:56	f	yeah 
5:53:44	5:53:50	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
6:2:7	6:2:12	g	five
6:4:1	6:4:7	g	like three inches 
6:4:32	6:4:33	f	do IY go around it 
6:4:28	6:4:37	g	and
6:6:53	6:7:2	g	just do it like this ok
6:7:23	6:7:29	g	uhm
6:8:45	6:8:52	f	ok
6:9:6	6:9:14	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
6:13:15	6:13:22	f	ok
6:16:57	6:17:1	f	ok
6:17:1	6:17:3	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
