start
0:0:44	0:0:49	g	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
0:3:24	0:3:30	g	and 
0:3:27	0:3:30	g	well just
0:4:6	0:4:8	g	and IY re going up like
0:5:13	0:5:20	g	are IY  
0:7:0	0:7:6	g	they re there
0:8:57	0:8:58	f	ok
0:8:56	0:9:4	g	ok
0:9:7	0:9:15	g	and then IY go straight
0:9:41	0:9:43	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
0:11:12	0:11:19	g	maybe like
0:11:31	0:11:32	f	ok
0:13:54	0:14:2	g	kind of across from stony desert
0:14:42	0:14:45	g	IY don t know
0:14:55	0:14:57	g	uhm
0:15:54	0:16:1	g	three inches
0:17:33	0:17:39	g	and that s where the plane crash is
0:18:20	0:18:22	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
0:18:20	0:18:24	f	ok
0:20:0	0:20:9	f	and then what 
0:26:38	0:26:42	g	three inches
0:27:28	0:27:33	g	IY just kind of slope down
0:28:47	0:28:53	f	and to the right 
0:29:22	0:29:23	g	and then IY  IY go up
0:33:13	0:33:21	f	ok
0:33:31	0:33:40	g	ok
0:39:49	0:39:49	g	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
0:39:59	0:40:1	g	so that s about IY would say
0:40:22	0:40:28	g	uhm
0:40:51	0:40:52	g	to the lake 
0:40:47	0:40:56	g	have a s 
0:41:27	0:41:33	g	not right at the stony desert
0:42:42	0:42:44	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
0:42:44	0:42:47	g	well
0:44:49	0:44:51	f	ok
0:45:0	0:45:2	g	no
0:45:19	0:45:25	g	three inches straight across
0:46:25	0:46:34	f	mm hmm
0:48:59	0:49:5	g	ok
0:49:54	0:49:59	g	to the left
0:51:56	0:51:59	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
0:52:26	0:52:27	g	a little bit too
0:53:13	0:53:18	g	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
0:54:29	0:54:30	g	and
0:54:41	0:54:47	f	ok
0:57:34	0:57:39	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
0:57:36	0:57:40	g	uhm
0:59:16	0:59:18	f	do IY go through anything 
0:59:23	0:59:23	f	oh
0:59:47	0:59:54	g	is the plane crash  
1:0:11	1:0:19	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
1:0:18	1:0:27	f	mm hmm
1:3:13	1:3:13	g	hmm
1:3:23	1:3:24	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
1:3:46	1:3:50	g	ok
1:6:2	1:6:7	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
1:7:18	1:7:22	g	so IY re at the hot springs
1:7:27	1:7:29	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
1:8:20	1:8:28	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
1:10:0	1:10:9	g	to the left
1:12:8	1:12:16	f	ok
1:14:46	1:14:50	g	ok
1:19:8	1:19:9	g	and then IY are
1:20:5	1:20:10	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
1:23:32	1:23:39	g	and there s a plane crash
1:24:8	1:24:12	g	ok 
1:27:23	1:27:28	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
1:27:32	1:27:35	g	uhm
1:31:17	1:31:20	f	mm hmm
1:33:1	1:33:3	f	elephants 
1:33:19	1:33:24	g	so
1:34:51	1:34:59	f	IY hit some rocks though
1:35:52	1:36:1	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
1:36:29	1:36:37	g	ok
1:40:50	1:40:59	g	uhm
1:41:4	1:41:11	f	uh IY don t know know what to say
1:41:24	1:41:28	g	it s right next to it
1:41:42	1:41:48	f	around the top of the lake 
1:43:46	1:43:53	f	so wait
1:46:1	1:46:7	g	ok
1:46:6	1:46:7	f	ok
1:46:8	1:46:17	g	after the circle
1:48:22	1:48:26	f	ok
1:49:41	1:49:41	g	the  
1:52:30	1:52:33	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
1:55:55	1:56:3	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
1:56:19	1:56:24	f	IY ve a plane crash though
1:58:12	1:58:16	f	to the left
2:1:19	2:1:27	f	ok
2:1:49	2:1:53	g	ok well
2:2:2	2:2:6	f	ok
2:3:16	2:3:23	f	ok
2:4:44	2:4:53	g	and then IY slope down to the left
2:5:33	2:5:33	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
2:6:13	2:6:20	g	and 
2:6:44	2:6:44	g	IY wanna kind of curve
2:6:49	2:6:56	g	and then
2:7:59	2:8:0	g	and then
2:14:51	2:14:53	g	around the bottom of it
2:16:45	2:16:45	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
2:16:41	2:16:47	g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
2:18:1	2:18:2	g	ok
2:25:5	2:25:5	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
2:25:8	2:25:12	g	then
2:28:26	2:28:30	g	ok
2:31:13	2:31:21	g	for like
2:31:33	2:31:35	g	so IY make that circle
2:31:41	2:31:45	g	IY re sloping
2:35:9	2:35:16	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
2:38:43	2:38:47	f	yep
2:39:47	2:39:50	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
2:40:7	2:40:13	g	ok
2:43:32	2:43:32	g	ok
2:45:30	2:45:38	g	uhm
2:47:48	2:47:53	g	from
2:47:53	2:47:57	g	uhm
2:48:0	2:48:3	g	IY got that 
2:48:32	2:48:34	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
2:49:26	2:49:27	g	IY would say
2:53:10	2:53:16	g	uhm
2:55:2	2:55:6	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
2:57:25	2:57:25	g	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
2:57:56	2:58:2	g	IY re going like
3:0:44	3:0:50	f	uhm IY
3:1:14	3:1:21	f	yeah
3:3:27	3:3:35	g	IY go straight down
3:3:32	3:3:39	f	ok
3:5:52	3:6:0	g	alright 
3:6:38	3:6:39	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
3:6:37	3:6:46	f	mm hmm
3:6:54	3:7:2	f	yeah
3:7:35	3:7:36	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
3:7:58	3:8:4	g	IY re starting
3:8:18	3:8:27	f	how many inches do IY think 
3:8:25	3:8:28	g	and then IY re going down
3:8:56	3:9:3	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
3:9:31	3:9:34	g	uhm
3:11:15	3:11:23	g	for like
3:11:21	3:11:28	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
3:12:21	3:12:25	g	slight
3:13:54	3:13:55	g	and IY go to the left a little bit
3:14:37	3:14:39	g	and then
3:15:55	3:15:55	f	to 
3:16:11	3:16:14	g	are IY in like   
3:19:13	3:19:17	g	just do it like this ok
3:20:6	3:20:8	g	IY re actually starting like right
3:21:19	3:21:26	f	mm hmm
3:25:32	3:25:36	g	five
3:25:43	3:25:50	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
3:31:5	3:31:11	g	and then IY slope up
3:31:33	3:31:34	g	after plane crash
3:31:54	3:31:54	f	ok
3:33:55	3:34:0	g	like
3:34:16	3:34:21	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
3:39:5	3:39:14	g	IY re going about
3:39:22	3:39:25	g	and is to the left
3:39:26	3:39:27	g	ok
3:39:36	3:39:37	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
3:39:51	3:39:51	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
3:41:16	3:41:20	g	uhm
3:42:11	3:42:12	g	that s about five or six inches
3:44:29	3:44:31	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
3:44:30	3:44:32	g	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
3:45:51	3:45:55	g	alright alright well just
3:46:1	3:46:7	g	maybe four inches on the paper
3:48:59	3:49:4	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right
3:50:38	3:50:42	g	IY make
3:50:46	3:50:48	g	it s not a big curve
3:51:25	3:51:31	g	IY re starting at the stony desert
3:51:38	3:51:46	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
3:52:8	3:52:14	g	ok
3:52:37	3:52:38	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
3:54:13	3:54:21	f	yeah IY see that
3:54:37	3:54:44	g	and then
3:54:53	3:54:58	f	ok
3:55:17	3:55:17	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
3:56:12	3:56:13	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
3:57:14	3:57:16	f	mm hmm
3:57:39	3:57:41	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
3:58:37	3:58:39	g	to the white mountain
3:58:50	3:58:53	g	uhm
3:58:56	3:59:2	f	IY know IY have different things so
3:59:9	3:59:13	f	to the right 
4:0:36	4:0:41	g	four or five inches to the left
4:2:12	4:2:12	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
4:3:29	4:3:34	g	and then
4:3:34	4:3:37	g	alright 
4:3:58	4:4:3	g	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
4:5:42	4:5:48	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
4:8:7	4:8:16	f	nope IY have a white mountain
4:9:53	4:10:1	g	ok and then IY re going
4:10:19	4:10:27	g	ok
4:11:2	4:11:11	g	no
4:13:52	4:14:0	g	and IY re sloping to the left
4:14:50	4:14:52	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
4:15:6	4:15:10	g	like four or five inches to the left
4:15:58	4:16:4	g	for about two inches
4:17:21	4:17:21	g	no IY have  
4:21:39	4:21:43	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
4:22:31	4:22:34	g	IY move to the left
4:24:9	4:24:16	g	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
4:24:18	4:24:19	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
4:24:38	4:24:47	g	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
4:27:47	4:27:50	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
4:29:20	4:29:27	f	to the left of the antelope
4:30:40	4:30:44	g	so IY go three inches straight
4:30:57	4:30:59	g	uhm
4:32:13	4:32:17	f	IY hit some round rocks
4:35:36	4:35:42	g	and

4:40:55	4:40:57	g	uhm
4:43:25	4:43:31	f	IY have to back up a little bit
4:44:16	4:44:19	g	and then
4:44:14	4:44:20	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
4:44:14	4:44:22	g	to IY right 
4:44:32	4:44:33	g	ok
4:44:37	4:44:43	f	ok
4:44:56	4:45:2	g	maybe

4:49:14	4:49:23	f	IY go to a lake 
4:50:27	4:50:32	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
4:50:56	4:51:0	g	no IY don t have a waterhole
4:52:27	4:52:36	g	about like
4:52:55	4:53:1	f	ok
4:55:33	4:55:38	g	uhm

4:58:4	4:58:9	g	ok
4:58:42	4:58:43	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
4:58:35	4:58:44	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
4:58:41	4:58:46	g	ok
4:59:34	4:59:38	f	yeah and IY went straight up
5:0:21	5:0:21	f	ok wait hold on
5:1:51	5:1:58	f	IY m three inches above the savannah
5:2:42	5:2:42	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
5:2:54	5:3:1	f	and
5:3:46	5:3:53	f	ok
5:4:42	5:4:46	g	ok
5:4:52	5:5:0	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
5:4:59	5:5:1	g	like three inches 
5:6:46	5:6:54	g	couple miles or something
5:6:50	5:6:59	g	like maybe an inch
5:8:20	5:8:26	f	yeah 
5:9:9	5:9:16	f	ok
5:9:33	5:9:37	g	straight up
5:11:3	5:11:6	g	ok IY re at the savannah
5:12:14	5:12:23	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
5:12:26	5:12:27	g	ok
5:13:54	5:14:1	f	ok
5:15:56	5:15:58	g	like
5:16:17	5:16:17	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
5:17:41	5:17:45	f	ok
5:17:43	5:17:48	g	uhm
5:18:18	5:18:27	g	ok
5:18:24	5:18:28	g	probably the same thing
5:18:55	5:19:1	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
5:21:49	5:21:49	g	uhm
5:22:31	5:22:33	g	IY plane crash 
5:22:42	5:22:50	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
5:24:19	5:24:24	g	and IY re going
5:24:38	5:24:46	g	and then
5:25:23	5:25:28	g	yes
5:25:33	5:25:39	g	to the left
5:25:41	5:25:48	g	IY re kind of going  
5:25:42	5:25:51	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
5:26:12	5:26:20	g	no there s no elephants
5:27:45	5:27:53	g	a quarter of an inch
5:28:2	5:28:2	g	on IY sheet anyway
5:28:3	5:28:9	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
5:31:37	5:31:39	g	yes
5:33:20	5:33:23	f	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
5:33:43	5:33:44	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
5:35:18	5:35:27	g	and IY just go straight up
5:35:24	5:35:33	g	like
5:36:19	5:36:26	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
5:37:2	5:37:4	f	ok
5:37:0	5:37:9	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
5:37:11	5:37:12	f	ok
5:40:4	5:40:7	f	ok
5:41:16	5:41:17	g	so anyway

5:43:4	5:43:4	g	but
5:43:21	5:43:22	g	IY re just going down
5:46:23	5:46:25	g	ok
5:48:17	5:48:19	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
5:48:30	5:48:32	f	 IY m at the savannah
5:50:11	5:50:16	g	and IY re going straight up
5:50:16	5:50:18	f	ok
5:51:54	5:51:56	g	what 
5:53:8	5:53:15	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
5:54:6	5:54:15	f	ok
5:55:34	5:55:40	g	and then IY go
5:57:45	5:57:54	g	are IY anywhere near there 
5:59:21	5:59:28	g	uhm
6:0:10	6:0:12	g	do IY have roman baths 
6:0:22	6:0:25	g	like an inch
6:1:44	6:1:50	f	ok
6:1:55	6:2:2	g	uh like
6:2:43	6:2:49	f	mm  mm
6:2:58	6:3:6	g	ok
6:3:6	6:3:13	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
6:3:32	6:3:32	g	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
6:4:16	6:4:23	g	and then IY slope
6:5:41	6:5:49	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
6:8:0	6:8:4	g	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
6:9:31	6:9:34	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
6:9:49	6:9:50	g	yes IY re going towards the lake
6:10:52	6:10:59	g	maybe like
6:13:32	6:13:37	g	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
6:14:33	6:14:42	g	IY slope down again
6:16:8	6:16:14	g	just a slight slope
