8	0:8:55	0:9:0	and then
9	0:9:39	0:9:45	IY re at the plane crash
10	0:10:50	0:10:53	IY re starting at the stony desert
11	0:10:59	0:11:5	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
12	0:11:28	0:11:33	so that s about IY would say
13	0:14:16	0:14:25	uhm and there is a stony desert
14	0:16:9	0:16:15	uhm

29	0:38:32	0:38:36	around the bottom of it
30	0:39:2	0:39:6	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
31	0:39:15	0:39:22	IY move to the left
33	0:40:20	0:40:27	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
35	0:44:38	0:44:41	go up like three  three and a half inches
38	0:46:25	0:46:26	so IY go three inches straight
39	0:46:35	0:46:40	uhm
40	0:48:21	0:48:30	and then IY slope up
41	0:50:42	0:50:43	uhm
43	0:52:0	0:52:0	IY re actually starting like right
45	0:52:29	0:52:35	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
47	0:55:55	0:55:57	ok
49	0:56:10	0:56:16	like IY re sloping
51	0:58:8	0:58:17	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
53	0:59:53	0:59:57	what 
54	1:0:18	1:0:26	like
55	1:0:50	1:0:56	like
57	1:2:36	1:2:44	like four or five inches to the left

59	1:7:58	1:8:4	ok
60	1:9:37	1:9:38	uhm
61	1:9:38	1:9:41	no
62	1:11:30	1:11:31	from
64	1:12:16	1:12:20	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
65	1:13:14	1:13:15	well
66	1:13:31	1:13:32	and then
67	1:14:41	1:14:48	after the circle

69	1:17:55	1:17:58	uhm
70	1:18:1	1:18:2	and then IY are
71	1:18:25	1:18:33	to IY right 
72	1:20:15	1:20:17	are IY in like almost the top of the
73	1:21:39	1:21:45	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
74	1:25:36	1:25:39	ok
75	1:26:18	1:26:20	do IY have roman baths 
76	1:26:28	1:26:31	ok
79	1:28:24	1:28:26	there s a there s  
81	1:29:6	1:29:6	and IY just go straight up
83	1:31:55	1:31:56	and then
85	1:32:23	1:32:28	and then IY slope
87	1:38:43	1:38:52	and then IY go straight
88	1:39:5	1:39:12	and is to the left

99	1:52:58	1:52:58	and it slopes a little bit to the right
100	1:54:46	1:54:55	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
102	1:56:32	1:56:38	ok IY re at the savannah
103	1:57:2	1:57:7	the slate mountain is towards the right
105	2:2:58	2:3:0	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
106	2:3:12	2:3:20	well just
107	2:3:28	2:3:35	three inches
108	2:4:2	2:4:11	uhm
109	2:4:26	2:4:34	ok
110	2:6:0	2:6:7	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
111	2:7:16	2:7:24	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
112	2:7:23	2:7:29	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
114	2:9:28	2:9:31	and then IY re going down
115	2:12:37	2:12:41	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
116	2:13:20	2:13:28	ok
118	2:19:15	2:19:20	no there s no elephants
119	2:20:31	2:20:39	IY re sloping
120	2:22:1	2:22:4	alright 
122	2:23:20	2:23:27	and
123	2:24:37	2:24:40	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
124	2:24:36	2:24:43	for like
125	2:27:27	2:27:31	and 
126	2:27:44	2:27:50	and then
128	2:32:18	2:32:26	ok
129	2:33:56	2:34:2	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
130	2:34:26	2:34:33	three inches straight across
132	2:37:22	2:37:28	and
133	2:37:39	2:37:42	about like
134	2:39:48	2:39:55	couple miles or something
135	2:40:36	2:40:45	and IY re going straight up
136	2:41:33	2:41:34	yes
137	2:44:13	2:44:16	ok
139	2:46:47	2:46:54	straight up
140	2:50:54	2:50:59	after IY slope down IY d say
141	2:52:49	2:52:49	you
142	2:53:44	2:53:47	IY just kind of slope down
144	2:58:44	2:58:47	IY would say
145	2:59:13	2:59:16	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
146	2:59:24	2:59:32	no IY have  
147	3:0:3	3:0:8	ok 
148	3:0:12	3:0:16	to the left
149	3:1:10	3:1:16	and then IY  IY go up
150	3:1:12	3:1:20	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
151	3:3:36	3:3:43	IY make
152	3:6:37	3:6:38	then
153	3:7:9	3:7:16	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
154	3:7:39	3:7:41	and IY re going up like
155	3:8:18	3:8:20	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
156	3:8:31	3:8:35	IY re starting
159	3:13:8	3:13:10	like maybe an inch
161	3:19:29	3:19:32	alright alright well just
164	3:22:43	3:22:48	IY plane crash 
165	3:24:1	3:24:3	and IY slope is about an inch long
166	3:25:1	3:25:7	uhm
167	3:25:52	3:26:1	to the white mountain
168	3:28:15	3:28:24	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
170	3:32:2	3:32:2	and then
171	3:34:33	3:34:38	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
172	3:35:6	3:35:7	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
173	3:35:46	3:35:53	after that IY go straight again
174	3:37:30	3:37:31	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
175	3:39:4	3:39:5	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
176	3:39:20	3:39:22	alright 
178	3:41:39	3:41:45	like an inch
179	3:41:58	3:42:5	probably the same thing
180	3:42:14	3:42:20	ok
182	3:45:27	3:45:28	and then IY go
183	3:46:34	3:46:41	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
186	3:49:40	3:49:47	to the left
187	3:50:12	3:50:17	uhhh no
188	3:50:40	3:50:43	just a slight slope
190	3:55:52	3:55:52	yes IY re going towards the lake
191	3:57:12	3:57:14	well alright
195	4:4:27	4:4:27	maybe
196	4:5:59	4:6:2	uhm
197	4:6:28	4:6:30	uh like
198	4:6:28	4:6:31	is the plane crash  
199	4:7:4	4:7:6	five
200	4:9:36	4:9:39	couple inches IY re sloping down
201	4:10:55	4:10:56	so IY make that circle
202	4:12:32	4:12:35	IY wanna kind of curve
205	4:13:29	4:13:33	and IY go down IY slope to the right
206	4:14:6	4:14:13	no
207	4:17:2	4:17:7	slight
208	4:21:22	4:21:22	ok and then IY re going
209	4:21:40	4:21:49	and IY re sloping to the left
210	4:22:4	4:22:8	for like
211	4:23:39	4:23:44	and then
212	4:24:25	4:24:27	IY go straight down
213	4:26:29	4:26:38	ok
214	4:27:31	4:27:36	are IY  
216	4:29:5	4:29:7	kind of across from stony desert
217	4:30:47	4:30:55	yes
218	4:31:41	4:31:41	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
219	4:32:29	4:32:33	and then
220	4:33:30	4:33:32	ok
221	4:34:11	4:34:11	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
222	4:34:25	4:34:33	they re there
223	4:37:20	4:37:22	uhm
224	4:41:58	4:42:4	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
225	4:42:11	4:42:11	ok
226	4:42:22	4:42:24	uhm
227	4:42:28	4:42:36	uhm
228	4:42:55	4:43:4	four or five inches to the left
230	4:45:1	4:45:9	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
231	4:45:42	4:45:46	so IY re at the hot springs
234	4:46:43	4:46:43	no IY don t have any rocks
235	4:47:22	4:47:29	where IY re going down to a plane crash
237	4:47:43	4:47:48	and then
239	4:48:35	4:48:39	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
240	4:48:46	4:48:48	are IY in like   
241	4:52:55	4:53:0	on IY sheet anyway
243	4:55:42	4:55:50	and that s where the plane crash is
245	4:57:5	4:57:12	not right at the stony desert
247	5:3:32	5:3:35	well
248	5:4:53	5:5:2	ok
249	5:5:21	5:5:22	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
250	5:6:11	5:6:14	IY slope down again
251	5:7:40	5:7:47	ok
252	5:10:50	5:10:58	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
254	5:18:1	5:18:9	alright well IY ll keep going and see
257	5:22:32	5:22:34	ok
259	5:24:21	5:24:24	but
260	5:26:21	5:26:21	like three inches 
261	5:29:8	5:29:9	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
264	5:33:5	5:33:11	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
266	5:34:24	5:34:28	to the left
268	5:36:8	5:36:8	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
270	5:37:26	5:37:30	a little bit too
273	5:40:16	5:40:17	three inches
274	5:41:1	5:41:7	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
277	5:43:0	5:43:9	like
278	5:44:39	5:44:45	after plane crash
279	5:46:47	5:46:47	uhm
280	5:47:28	5:47:33	uhm
283	5:50:13	5:50:13	ok IY plane crash isn t there
284	5:51:7	5:51:12	maybe like
285	5:52:56	5:53:0	and there s a plane crash
286	5:53:17	5:53:17	to the right
287	5:53:26	5:53:29	and IY should have a straight line there
289	5:55:10	5:55:19	IY got that 
290	5:55:31	5:55:36	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
291	5:59:57	6:0:5	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
293	6:1:36	6:1:45	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
294	6:1:52	6:1:53	ok
295	6:2:16	6:2:17	ok
296	6:4:6	6:4:8	IY re going like
297	6:7:25	6:7:32	and IY go to the left a little bit
298	6:8:8	6:8:10	maybe like
299	6:8:22	6:8:27	ok
300	6:8:27	6:8:34	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
303	6:12:59	6:13:1	alright are IY starting  near the  
304	6:15:21	6:15:27	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
306	6:17:39	6:17:41	that s IY little slope
307	6:19:52	6:20:1	for about two inches
310	6:23:14	6:23:18	and then IY slope down to the left
312	6:25:7	6:25:15	IY re just going down
313	6:25:20	6:25:22	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
314	6:25:20	6:25:23	and 
315	6:26:5	6:26:7	uhm
316	6:26:34	6:26:42	an inch maybe a little bit less
317	6:27:55	6:28:0	that s about five or six inches
318	6:27:55	6:28:2	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
321	6:29:54	6:30:3	no IY don t have a waterhole
325	6:33:44	6:33:52	ok
326	6:35:55	6:35:57	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
328	6:38:17	6:38:24	like
329	6:40:12	6:40:18	a little
330	6:40:29	6:40:37	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
333	6:43:32	6:43:34	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
335	6:44:49	6:44:50	it s not a big curve
337	6:44:58	6:45:4	maybe four inches on the paper
340	6:52:57	6:53:1	so anyway
341	6:53:7	6:53:14	to the lake 
342	6:53:20	6:53:23	just do it like this ok
start f
0	0:0:54	0:0:57	nope IY have a white mountain
5	0:6:40	0:6:49	so wait
21	0:25:38	0:25:47	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
23	0:29:21	0:29:29	ok
28	0:37:41	0:37:47	yeah and IY went straight up
32	0:40:0	0:40:1	to the right 
34	0:41:33	0:41:39	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
36	0:45:27	0:45:28	do IY go around it 
37	0:46:1	0:46:9	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
42	0:51:50	0:51:58	yeah 
44	0:52:5	0:52:13	yeah
46	0:54:40	0:54:49	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
48	0:56:12	0:56:12	ok
50	0:57:33	0:57:38	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
52	0:58:46	0:58:46	and to the right 
56	1:1:49	1:1:51	mm hmm
63	1:11:35	1:11:36	ok
77	1:27:26	1:27:30	IY have to back up a little bit
78	1:27:53	1:28:2	ok
80	1:28:57	1:29:3	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
82	1:30:1	1:30:1	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
84	1:31:55	1:32:1	ok
86	1:38:18	1:38:18	to the left
89	1:41:23	1:41:24	ok

113	2:9:23	2:9:26	IY ve a plane crash though
117	2:18:58	2:19:4	ok
121	2:22:13	2:22:15	and there s a collapsed shelter
127	2:30:3	2:30:10	yeah
131	2:36:44	2:36:50	yeah
138	2:44:49	2:44:55	IY hit some rocks though

163	3:21:21	3:21:21	and
169	3:30:7	3:30:16	do IY go by the plane crash 
177	3:40:51	3:40:57	ok
181	3:42:44	3:42:50	ok

253	5:14:28	5:14:29	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
255	5:19:0	5:19:9	ok
256	5:21:26	5:21:30	yeah
258	5:24:9	5:24:14	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok

10	0:10:50	0:10:53	IY re starting at the stony desert
11	0:10:59	0:11:5	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start

102	1:56:32	1:56:38	ok IY re at the savannah
103	1:57:2	1:57:7	the slate mountain is towards the right
105	2:2:58	2:3:0	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
106	2:3:12	2:3:20	well just
107	2:3:28	2:3:35	three inches

122	2:23:20	2:23:27	and
123	2:24:37	2:24:40	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
124	2:24:36	2:24:43	for like
125	2:27:27	2:27:31	and 
126	2:27:44	2:27:50	and then

152	3:6:37	3:6:38	then
153	3:7:9	3:7:16	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
154	3:7:39	3:7:41	and IY re going up like
155	3:8:18	3:8:20	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
156	3:8:31	3:8:35	IY re starting
159	3:13:8	3:13:10	like maybe an inch
161	3:19:29	3:19:32	alright alright well just
164	3:22:43	3:22:48	IY plane crash 
165	3:24:1	3:24:3	and IY slope is about an inch long
166	3:25:1	3:25:7	uhm
167	3:25:52	3:26:1	to the white mountain
168	3:28:15	3:28:24	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
170	3:32:2	3:32:2	and then
171	3:34:33	3:34:38	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
172	3:35:6	3:35:7	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
173	3:35:46	3:35:53	after that IY go straight again
174	3:37:30	3:37:31	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
175	3:39:4	3:39:5	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
176	3:39:20	3:39:22	alright 
178	3:41:39	3:41:45	like an inch
179	3:41:58	3:42:5	probably the same thing
180	3:42:14	3:42:20	ok
182	3:45:27	3:45:28	and then IY go
183	3:46:34	3:46:41	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
186	3:49:40	3:49:47	to the left
187	3:50:12	3:50:17	uhhh no
188	3:50:40	3:50:43	just a slight slope

197	4:6:28	4:6:30	uh like
198	4:6:28	4:6:31	is the plane crash  
199	4:7:4	4:7:6	five
200	4:9:36	4:9:39	couple inches IY re sloping down
201	4:10:55	4:10:56	so IY make that circle
202	4:12:32	4:12:35	IY wanna kind of curve
205	4:13:29	4:13:33	and IY go down IY slope to the right
206	4:14:6	4:14:13	no
207	4:17:2	4:17:7	slight
208	4:21:22	4:21:22	ok and then IY re going

214	4:27:31	4:27:36	are IY  
216	4:29:5	4:29:7	kind of across from stony desert
217	4:30:47	4:30:55	yes
218	4:31:41	4:31:41	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
219	4:32:29	4:32:33	and then
220	4:33:30	4:33:32	ok
221	4:34:11	4:34:11	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches

228	4:42:55	4:43:4	four or five inches to the left
230	4:45:1	4:45:9	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
231	4:45:42	4:45:46	so IY re at the hot springs
234	4:46:43	4:46:43	no IY don t have any rocks
235	4:47:22	4:47:29	where IY re going down to a plane crash
237	4:47:43	4:47:48	and then
239	4:48:35	4:48:39	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
240	4:48:46	4:48:48	are IY in like   
241	4:52:55	4:53:0	on IY sheet anyway
243	4:55:42	4:55:50	and that s where the plane crash is
245	4:57:5	4:57:12	not right at the stony desert
247	5:3:32	5:3:35	well
248	5:4:53	5:5:2	ok
249	5:5:21	5:5:22	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
250	5:6:11	5:6:14	IY slope down again
251	5:7:40	5:7:47	ok
252	5:10:50	5:10:58	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
254	5:18:1	5:18:9	alright well IY ll keep going and see
257	5:22:32	5:22:34	ok
259	5:24:21	5:24:24	but
260	5:26:21	5:26:21	like three inches 
261	5:29:8	5:29:9	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
264	5:33:5	5:33:11	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
266	5:34:24	5:34:28	to the left
268	5:36:8	5:36:8	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
270	5:37:26	5:37:30	a little bit too
273	5:40:16	5:40:17	three inches
274	5:41:1	5:41:7	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
277	5:43:0	5:43:9	like
278	5:44:39	5:44:45	after plane crash
279	5:46:47	5:46:47	uhm
280	5:47:28	5:47:33	uhm
283	5:50:13	5:50:13	ok IY plane crash isn t there
284	5:51:7	5:51:12	maybe like
285	5:52:56	5:53:0	and there s a plane crash
286	5:53:17	5:53:17	to the right
287	5:53:26	5:53:29	and IY should have a straight line there
289	5:55:10	5:55:19	IY got that 
290	5:55:31	5:55:36	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
291	5:59:57	6:0:5	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
293	6:1:36	6:1:45	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
294	6:1:52	6:1:53	ok
295	6:2:16	6:2:17	ok
296	6:4:6	6:4:8	IY re going like
297	6:7:25	6:7:32	and IY go to the left a little bit
298	6:8:8	6:8:10	maybe like
299	6:8:22	6:8:27	ok
300	6:8:27	6:8:34	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
303	6:12:59	6:13:1	alright are IY starting  near the  
304	6:15:21	6:15:27	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
306	6:17:39	6:17:41	that s IY little slope
307	6:19:52	6:20:1	for about two inches
310	6:23:14	6:23:18	and then IY slope down to the left
312	6:25:7	6:25:15	IY re just going down
313	6:25:20	6:25:22	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
314	6:25:20	6:25:23	and 
315	6:26:5	6:26:7	uhm
316	6:26:34	6:26:42	an inch maybe a little bit less
317	6:27:55	6:28:0	that s about five or six inches
318	6:27:55	6:28:2	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
321	6:29:54	6:30:3	no IY don t have a waterhole
325	6:33:44	6:33:52	ok
