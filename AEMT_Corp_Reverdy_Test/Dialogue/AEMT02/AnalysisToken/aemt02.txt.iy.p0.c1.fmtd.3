0:1:17	0:1:19	g	325	79			and then
0:3:30	0:3:30	g	131	210			what 
0:3:31	0:3:35	g	290	215			ok
0:3:54	0:3:57	g	194	237			and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
0:4:9	0:4:10	f	333	250			mm hmm
0:5:15	0:5:17	g	5	317			well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
0:6:18	0:6:22	g	90	382			the  
0:7:37	0:7:39	g	106	459			ok
0:8:15	0:8:23	g	50	503			IY re just going down
0:9:25	0:9:26	f	172	566			 IY m at the savannah
0:13:13	0:13:14	g	149	794			ok
0:13:40	0:13:42	g	183	822			IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
0:13:47	0:13:55	f	104	835			ok
0:14:54	0:14:58	g	87	898			yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
0:15:15	0:15:19	g	235	919			uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
0:16:16	0:16:18	f	85	978			around the top of the lake 
0:16:56	0:17:4	f	220	1024			to 
0:17:2	0:17:5	g	307	1025			uhm
0:18:37	0:18:37	g	328	1117			IY re going about
0:19:6	0:19:8	g	165	1148			no IY have  
0:20:42	0:20:44	g	18	1244			ok
0:20:53	0:20:59	f	73	1259			so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
0:23:35	0:23:36	g	221	1416			you
0:24:56	0:24:59	g	335	1499			and then
0:25:46	0:25:55	g	37	1555			maybe like
0:26:42	0:26:42	f	206	1602			yeah IY see that
0:26:41	0:26:44	g	292	1604			and then IY slope up
0:26:54	0:27:0	f	130	1620			yeah
0:27:56	0:27:59	f	279	1679			ok
0:29:41	0:29:44	g	310	1784			and 
0:30:58	0:30:59	g	228	1859			are IY anywhere near there 
0:31:22	0:31:27	g	53	1887			and then IY slope
0:31:34	0:31:40	g	136	1900			no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
0:32:10	0:32:19	g	94	1939			and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
0:32:34	0:32:35	g	100	1955			maybe like
0:32:37	0:32:42	f	108	1962			ok
0:32:36	0:32:42	f	318	1962			up diagonally to the right of the antelope
0:32:45	0:32:48	g	304	1968			and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
0:35:8	0:35:16	f	267	2116			how many inches do IY think 
0:35:46	0:35:50	g	21	2150			uhm
0:36:14	0:36:14	f	222	2174			so wait
0:37:15	0:37:20	g	259	2240			ok well
0:39:43	0:39:51	g	178	2391			and IY go to the left a little bit
0:39:59	0:40:3	g	150	2403			IY re starting
0:44:27	0:44:29	g	72	2669			ok 
0:44:54	0:45:3	f	193	2703			curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
0:45:58	0:45:58	f	177	2758			IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
0:46:5	0:46:14	g	287	2774			no IY don t have a waterhole
0:50:22	0:50:23	f	331	3023			ok
0:52:36	0:52:41	g	202	3161			uhm
0:55:35	0:55:39	g	240	3339			an inch maybe a little bit less
0:59:31	0:59:37	g	179	3577			and then IY re going down
1:0:6	1:0:15	g	107	3615			it s like a slight little upwards to the right
1:0:38	1:0:40	g	305	3640			for about two inches
1:1:41	1:1:47	g	285	3707			yes
1:2:4	1:2:8	g	116	3728			is the plane crash  
1:3:17	1:3:19	g	89	3799			ok
1:4:10	1:4:12	g	303	3852			where IY re going down to a plane crash
1:5:36	1:5:45	f	337	3945			oh
1:6:15	1:6:19	g	79	3979			and then
1:7:36	1:7:36	g	60	4056			ok
1:8:10	1:8:16	g	225	4096			and it slopes a little bit to the right
1:10:8	1:10:16	g	132	4216			ok
1:10:56	1:10:58	g	143	4258			ok
1:11:31	1:11:34	g	336	4294			a little bit too
1:12:12	1:12:20	f	278	4340			ok
1:12:56	1:13:0	f	112	4380			mm hmm
1:16:5	1:16:9	g	169	4569			no
1:17:47	1:17:53	g	74	4673			yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
1:17:45	1:17:53	f	265	4673			IY know IY have different things so
1:19:2	1:19:4	g	256	4744			are IY anywere near there 
1:20:35	1:20:43	f	0	4843			uh IY don t know know what to say
1:21:0	1:21:9	g	67	4869			uhhh no
1:21:13	1:21:15	f	301	4875			so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
1:22:1	1:22:2	g	309	4922			to the left
1:23:38	1:23:42	g	162	5022			IY plane crash 
1:25:44	1:25:52	g	214	5152			and then IY slope down to the left
1:28:19	1:28:23	f	201	5303			do IY go by the plane crash 
1:30:33	1:30:33	g	12	5433			just do it like this ok
1:31:11	1:31:12	f	299	5472			elephants 
1:31:33	1:31:40	g	341	5500			uhm
1:33:33	1:33:33	g	33	5613			aways about like four inches  four or five inches
1:33:46	1:33:46	g	197	5626			and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
1:36:27	1:36:34	g	207	5794			and then IY go
1:37:31	1:37:36	f	311	5856			ok
1:40:21	1:40:28	f	327	6028			and there s a collapsed shelter
1:41:53	1:42:1	g	314	6121			three inches
1:42:54	1:42:57	g	47	6177			yes IY re going towards the lake
1:46:48	1:46:52	g	129	6412			IY would say
1:46:54	1:46:59	f	324	6419			do IY go around it 
1:48:44	1:48:44	f	152	6524			ok
1:51:24	1:51:33	g	115	6693			and then
1:52:50	1:52:53	g	54	6773			and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
1:53:14	1:53:17	g	212	6797			uhm
1:53:46	1:53:47	f	200	6827			IY hit some rocks though
1:53:46	1:53:52	g	272	6832			uhm
1:54:29	1:54:29	g	125	6869			and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
1:54:24	1:54:31	f	117	6871			and then what 
1:54:38	1:54:38	g	261	6878			and then IY ll come to a savannah
1:55:14	1:55:21	g	191	6921			have a s 
1:55:29	1:55:38	g	51	6938			like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
1:56:7	1:56:13	g	15	6973			like three inches 
1:56:28	1:56:33	g	137	6993			as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
1:57:16	1:57:20	g	316	7040			like
1:58:53	1:58:58	g	4	7138			like
1:59:12	1:59:12	g	330	7152			ok
1:59:8	1:59:16	g	43	7156			so that s about IY would say
2:2:18	2:2:18	g	138	7338			and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
2:4:35	2:4:42	g	167	7482			to IY right 
2:7:3	2:7:6	g	114	7626			now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
2:7:9	2:7:16	f	66	7636			ok
2:8:36	2:8:37	f	110	7717			ok
2:12:38	2:12:42	f	118	7962			ok
2:13:2	2:13:11	f	29	7991			to the right 
2:14:39	2:14:43	g	19	8083			ok
2:14:54	2:14:59	g	319	8099			IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
2:15:46	2:15:50	g	13	8150			and then IY go straight
2:19:19	2:19:24	f	195	8364			ok
2:20:36	2:20:37	g	323	8437			there s a there s  
2:22:28	2:22:28	g	127	8548			are IY in like   
2:23:10	2:23:10	f	273	8590			ok
2:25:29	2:25:31	g	297	8731			ok
2:28:32	2:28:32	f	175	8912			ok
2:28:36	2:28:43	g	109	8923			a little
2:28:50	2:28:55	g	97	8935			around the bottom of it
2:29:7	2:29:15	f	260	8955			and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
2:31:30	2:31:32	g	211	9092			like maybe an inch
2:34:4	2:34:4	g	63	9244			and there s a plane crash
2:35:26	2:35:35	g	28	9335			IY go straight down
2:36:19	2:36:19	g	233	9379			IY re kind of going  
2:37:41	2:37:46	g	321	9466			ok
2:39:5	2:39:14	g	119	9554			well
2:44:15	2:44:23	g	159	9863			IY just kind of slope down
2:45:51	2:45:58	g	141	9958			after that IY go straight again
2:51:38	2:51:38	f	320	10298			it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
2:53:35	2:53:42	g	181	10422			like
2:54:2	2:54:11	g	306	10451			maybe IY have different things
2:54:38	2:54:40	g	180	10480			and then right around the antelope IY take a right
2:58:50	2:58:54	g	295	10734			and then
2:59:22	2:59:30	g	251	10770			it s right next to it
3:0:4	3:0:10	g	16	10810			uhm
3:0:9	3:0:17	g	237	10817			where are IY right now   start at the savannah
3:1:35	3:1:41	g	58	10901			well alright
3:1:42	3:1:47	g	124	10907			yes
3:1:50	3:1:57	g	69	10917			alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
3:2:14	3:2:23	g	174	10943			and IY should have a straight line there
3:4:32	3:4:32	f	247	11072			ok
3:4:58	3:5:6	g	39	11106			uhm
3:7:46	3:7:46	f	263	11266			IY m three inches above the savannah
3:8:24	3:8:33	g	144	11313			and 
3:11:1	3:11:4	g	30	11464			that s IY little slope
3:13:23	3:13:26	f	276	11606			mm hmm
3:14:7	3:14:10	f	146	11650			so IY pass a waterhole or no 
3:16:36	3:16:39	g	190	11799			and then
3:17:44	3:17:49	g	78	11869			IY re going like
3:17:50	3:17:59	g	25	11879			in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
3:19:25	3:19:26	g	241	11966			ok
3:22:15	3:22:22	g	170	12142			alright well IY ll keep going and see
3:24:30	3:24:31	g	186	12271			so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
3:26:40	3:26:49	f	147	12409			ok
3:26:50	3:26:57	g	216	12417			uhm

3:28:31	3:28:36	f	82	12516			yeah and IY went straight up
3:29:21	3:29:23	g	243	12563			ok IY plane crash isn t there
3:29:23	3:29:32	g	257	12572			couple inches IY re sloping down
3:30:0	3:30:0	g	126	12600			ok
3:31:2	3:31:9	g	1	12669			and that s where the plane crash is
3:31:45	3:31:45	g	161	12705			and IY just go straight up
3:31:49	3:31:56	g	269	12716			are IY  
3:33:55	3:33:59	g	204	12839			couple miles or something

4:10:55	4:10:56	g	250	15056			after IY slope down IY d say
4:11:5	4:11:10	g	103	15070			so IY make that circle
4:11:49	4:11:55	f	332	15115			do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
4:12:44	4:12:51	f	121	15171			to the left
4:14:46	4:14:53	g	168	15293			and IY re going up like

4:24:47	4:24:52	g	88	15892			to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
4:27:34	4:27:38	g	10	16058			probably the same thing
4:29:1	4:29:8	g	326	16148			IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
4:29:32	4:29:36	g	11	16176			ok IY re at the savannah
