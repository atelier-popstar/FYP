0:37:38	0:37:45	g	220	2265			and IY slope is about an inch long
0:37:49	0:37:49	f	206	2269			mm hmm
0:38:55	0:38:56	g	125	2336			have a s 
0:39:2	0:39:3	g	237	2343			but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
0:40:30	0:40:33	g	330	2433			and IY should have a straight line there
0:40:38	0:40:40	f	261	2440			IY go to a lake

2:3:6	2:3:10	f	328	7390			so IY go to the left of the antelope
2:4:50	2:4:50	g	291	7490			so anyway
2:4:52	2:4:54	f	148	7494			ok
2:5:52	2:6:0	g	275	7560			and then IY slope up
2:6:51	2:6:54	g	147	7614			three inches
2:8:24	2:8:31	g	45	7711			IY plane crash 
2:9:1	2:9:1	g	91	7741			three inches
2:9:11	2:9:11	g	321	7751			like
2:9:28	2:9:36	g	75	7776			after plane crash
2:10:17	2:10:20	g	95	7820			it s not a big curve
2:10:42	2:10:51	g	170	7851			are IY in like almost the top of the
2:12:34	2:12:34	g	267	7954			to the lake 
2:12:58	2:13:6	g	145	7986			now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
2:13:12	2:13:12	g	33	7992			maybe like
2:15:24	2:15:27	f	326	8127			ok
2:15:57	2:16:6	g	55	8166			like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
2:17:30	2:17:35	f	299	8255			yeah
2:24:21	2:24:29	g	149	8669			and IY re going straight up
2:24:51	2:24:51	g	304	8691			so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
2:25:31	2:25:34	f	138	8734			yeah
2:26:0	2:26:9	g	50	8769			are IY  
2:26:22	2:26:24	f	108	8784			and there s a collapsed shelter

2:29:9	2:29:15	g	310	8955			ok
2:32:36	2:32:37	f	54	9157			and
2:32:58	2:33:5	g	219	9185			like IY re sloping
2:37:10	2:37:17	g	68	9437			and that s where the plane crash is
2:37:28	2:37:35	g	6	9455			kind of across from stony desert
2:41:23	2:41:23	g	182	9683			it s right next to it
2:42:3	2:42:10	g	119	9730			IY re sloping
2:42:46	2:42:52	f	121	9772			and then what 
2:42:54	2:42:56	g	90	9776			and IY re going up like
2:42:47	2:42:56	g	97	9776			ok
2:44:18	2:44:20	g	139	9860			well
2:44:48	2:44:57	g	56	9897			not right at the stony desert
2:47:12	2:47:15	f	244	10035			mm hmm
2:50:33	2:50:41	g	172	10241			no IY have

2:59:40	2:59:43	f	215	10783			ok
3:0:9	3:0:17	g	205	10817			and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
3:0:15	3:0:18	g	126	10818			IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
3:1:53	3:2:0	g	183	10920			it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
3:2:21	3:2:23	g	203	10943			so IY re at the hot springs
3:3:21	3:3:30	g	260	11010			well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
3:3:53	3:3:55	f	19	11035			ok wait hold on
3:4:12	3:4:20	g	167	11060			the slate mountain is towards the right
3:10:16	3:10:21	g	186	11421			a quarter of an inch
3:11:33	3:11:34	g	116	11494			an inch maybe a little bit less
3:14:3	3:14:9	g	204	11649			and IY re sloping to the left
3:14:8	3:14:10	g	146	11650			like
3:15:47	3:15:52	f	104	11752			yeah IY see that

3:21:14	3:21:23	g	80	12083			alright well IY ll keep going and see
3:23:47	3:23:51	g	168	12231			the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
3:24:10	3:24:17	g	213	12257			no there s no elephants
3:25:13	3:25:14	f	194	12314			yeah
3:25:44	3:25:46	f	171	12346			IY m three inches above the savannah
3:26:31	3:26:34	g	34	12394			couple inches IY re sloping down
3:27:40	3:27:47	g	307	12467			like three inches 
3:29:6	3:29:12	g	333	12552			ok
3:29:29	3:29:32	g	99	12572			uhm
3:30:50	3:30:57	g	259	12657			and then IY slope
3:32:52	3:33:1	g	292	12781			IY make
3:36:18	3:36:18	g	243	12978			ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
3:36:28	3:36:30	f	317	12990			do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
3:40:23	3:40:26	f	155	13226			to the left
3:40:47	3:40:47	f	222	13247			ok
3:43:5	3:43:10	g	180	13390			and curve to  not down just curve to the left
3:44:8	3:44:10	g	313	13450			a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
3:44:40	3:44:41	g	230	13481			and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
3:47:0	3:47:2	g	127	13622			it s like a slight little upwards to the right
3:47:49	3:47:49	f	0	13669			ok
3:49:45	3:49:48	f	255	13788			IY hit some rocks though
3:51:50	3:51:50	g	153	13910			probably the same thing
3:53:13	3:53:16	g	257	13996			uhm
3:56:0	3:56:3	f	57	14163			yeah 
3:56:31	3:56:31	g	69	14191			are IY anywhere near there 
3:57:26	3:57:32	g	14	14252			from
3:58:34	3:58:42	f	263	14322			ok

4:2:24	4:2:24	g	300	14544			and 
4:6:26	4:6:31	g	101	14791			aways about like four inches  four or five inches
4:6:57	4:7:0	f	293	14820			IY ve a plane crash though
4:7:27	4:7:32	g	190	14852			ok
4:9:58	4:9:58	g	66	14998			and then IY go
4:12:58	4:12:59	f	134	15179			so IY pass a waterhole or no 
4:13:29	4:13:38	f	110	15218			ok
4:14:42	4:14:50	g	209	15290			uhm
4:16:44	4:16:49	g	37	15409			like
4:18:6	4:18:9	f	44	15489			it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
4:19:6	4:19:11	f	76	15551			am IY supposed to start at the same place 
4:20:23	4:20:28	f	73	15628			ok
4:20:29	4:20:30	f	106	15630			so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
4:22:7	4:22:16	g	63	15736			like maybe an inch
4:22:42	4:22:45	g	296	15765			yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
4:22:59	4:23:7	g	84	15787			IY re at the plane crash
4:23:50	4:23:51	f	189	15831			ok
4:24:39	4:24:39	f	52	15879			yeah
4:26:5	4:26:13	g	9	15973			IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
4:27:51	4:27:53	f	71	16073			so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
4:28:34	4:28:43	g	226	16123			IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
4:29:3	4:29:8	f	46	16148			mm  mm
4:29:58	4:30:5	g	200	16205			as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
4:31:15	4:31:20	g	272	16280			no
4:32:6	4:32:6	g	212	16326			uhm

4:37:18	4:37:26	g	26	16646			and then
4:38:51	4:38:51	g	122	16731			ok
4:40:21	4:40:30	g	247	16830			for about two inches
4:41:11	4:41:19	g	192	16879			for like
4:41:38	4:41:38	g	273	16898			IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
4:41:34	4:41:43	g	81	16903			alright 
4:42:52	4:42:54	g	150	16974			and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
4:44:48	4:44:56	g	10	17096			and IY re going
4:45:35	4:45:38	f	117	17138			to the right
