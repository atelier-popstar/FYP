start
start g
1	0:2:25	0:2:28	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
2	0:3:53	0:3:54	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
3	0:4:31	0:4:40	alright 
4	0:6:48	0:6:52	IY go straight down
5	0:6:57	0:7:4	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
6	0:7:29	0:7:37	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
7	0:8:30	0:8:31	ok
8	0:10:14	0:10:18	alright 
9	0:11:10	0:11:14	and IY re going straight up
11	0:11:40	0:11:43	ok
12	0:18:16	0:18:17	uh like
13	0:19:18	0:19:23	yes
15	0:26:22	0:26:29	alright alright well just
17	0:33:16	0:33:21	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
19	0:34:0	0:34:2	and then IY slope up
20	0:35:5	0:35:8	uhm
21	0:35:51	0:35:59	and then
22	0:38:26	0:38:28	IY re kind of going  
23	0:38:36	0:38:36	so that s about IY would say
24	0:39:30	0:39:31	like IY re sloping
26	0:40:37	0:40:37	so anyway
27	0:40:49	0:40:50	IY don t know
28	0:41:21	0:41:29	three inches
29	0:41:55	0:41:56	a little bit too
30	0:44:30	0:44:31	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
31	0:46:15	0:46:20	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
33	0:49:0	0:49:5	uhm
34	0:50:15	0:50:21	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
38	0:56:54	0:57:1	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
40	1:0:4	1:0:6	that s IY little slope
42	1:2:12	1:2:12	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
44	1:3:21	1:3:26	ok 
46	1:4:22	1:4:27	and 
47	1:5:3	1:5:8	well just
48	1:5:46	1:5:54	uhm and there is a stony desert
49	1:6:14	1:6:17	probably the same thing
50	1:6:51	1:6:59	straight up
53	1:13:1	1:13:2	IY re just going down
54	1:16:4	1:16:9	just a slight slope
55	1:16:22	1:16:24	and is to the left
56	1:19:2	1:19:5	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
58	1:19:27	1:19:34	and then IY go straight
60	1:21:58	1:22:6	ok
61	1:22:11	1:22:11	ok
62	1:22:33	1:22:34	hmm
63	1:22:44	1:22:48	and IY slope is about an inch long
64	1:23:53	1:23:53	IY re starting
65	1:24:9	1:24:17	and then
66	1:24:51	1:24:58	uhm
67	1:25:2	1:25:3	are IY  
68	1:29:15	1:29:20	ok
70	1:30:52	1:31:1	and then IY are
72	1:32:20	1:32:25	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
73	1:33:26	1:33:32	couple inches IY re sloping down
74	1:33:55	1:34:2	it s not a big curve
75	1:34:10	1:34:19	about like
76	1:35:23	1:35:29	yes
77	1:36:32	1:36:36	is the plane crash  
78	1:37:42	1:37:43	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
79	1:37:41	1:37:49	IY re actually starting like right
80	1:38:19	1:38:21	ok
81	1:41:34	1:41:38	a little
82	1:42:13	1:42:16	the  
83	1:43:26	1:43:26	to IY right 
85	1:45:57	1:45:58	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
86	1:46:38	1:46:42	maybe IY have different things
87	1:49:1	1:49:3	that s about five or six inches
88	1:50:15	1:50:15	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
89	1:51:0	1:51:6	no IY have  
90	1:51:24	1:51:32	ok
92	1:54:26	1:54:33	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
93	1:56:6	1:56:14	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
94	1:58:21	1:58:24	ok IY plane crash isn t there
95	1:59:10	1:59:14	well
97	2:1:2	2:1:2	for about two inches
98	2:2:27	2:2:27	ok
100	2:3:18	2:3:22	ok
101	2:4:9	2:4:17	ok
102	2:6:44	2:6:45	IY re going about
103	2:7:5	2:7:6	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
104	2:7:14	2:7:23	a quarter of an inch
105	2:8:26	2:8:27	and then IY go
108	2:10:42	2:10:46	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
109	2:10:48	2:10:52	ok
110	2:11:10	2:11:19	and then IY re going down
111	2:12:35	2:12:42	slight
113	2:13:46	2:13:49	and IY just go straight up
114	2:15:1	2:15:1	are IY in like   
117	2:15:44	2:15:53	and then
119	2:18:2	2:18:10	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
120	2:19:40	2:19:47	to the right
121	2:20:7	2:20:7	from
123	2:20:20	2:20:26	then
124	2:21:48	2:21:53	so
125	2:21:58	2:22:6	uhm
126	2:22:23	2:22:29	uhm
129	2:26:15	2:26:24	to the left
130	2:27:0	2:27:1	and IY should have a straight line there
131	2:27:40	2:27:47	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
133	2:28:1	2:28:9	uhm
134	2:29:37	2:29:43	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
137	2:38:54	2:38:55	for like
138	2:39:23	2:39:26	IY wanna kind of curve
139	2:42:48	2:42:50	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
141	2:46:27	2:46:29	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
142	2:49:42	2:49:42	no IY don t have a waterhole
143	2:55:47	2:55:50	like
144	2:56:21	2:56:25	IY got that 
145	2:56:36	2:56:41	just do it like this ok
147	2:58:17	2:58:17	four or five inches to the left
148	3:3:6	3:3:7	uhm
149	3:4:20	3:4:26	and then IY slope
151	3:5:58	3:5:59	like maybe an inch
152	3:6:55	3:7:1	uhm
153	3:10:32	3:10:35	so IY go three inches straight
154	3:12:39	3:12:47	IY re at the plane crash
155	3:12:59	3:13:6	no
156	3:13:21	3:13:27	maybe
161	3:18:5	3:18:12	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
162	3:18:16	3:18:17	ok
165	3:23:38	3:23:45	maybe like
166	3:25:36	3:25:41	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
167	3:27:9	3:27:16	and then IY  IY go up
170	3:31:5	3:31:9	like three inches 
171	3:32:6	3:32:6	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
174	3:32:46	3:32:52	like an inch
176	3:38:33	3:38:36	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
178	3:41:43	3:41:46	ok and then IY re going
180	3:44:25	3:44:33	ok
181	3:47:32	3:47:37	uhm
182	3:52:10	3:52:14	alright are IY starting  near the  
183	3:54:27	3:54:27	ok
184	3:54:32	3:54:34	they re there
185	3:54:43	3:54:43	ok
186	3:54:53	3:54:54	to the left
187	3:55:18	3:55:20	alright well IY ll keep going and see
188	3:55:24	3:55:33	IY just kind of slope down
189	3:56:26	3:56:34	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
190	3:56:40	3:56:41	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
191	3:57:24	3:57:31	like
192	3:59:6	3:59:9	do IY have roman baths 
193	3:59:9	3:59:15	are IY anywhere near there 
195	4:0:33	4:0:38	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
197	4:1:41	4:1:42	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
199	4:3:47	4:3:50	after the circle
200	4:4:27	4:4:35	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
201	4:5:26	4:5:33	to the left
203	4:6:30	4:6:34	are IY in like almost the top of the
207	4:13:36	4:13:39	kind of across from stony desert
208	4:14:33	4:14:42	so IY re at the hot springs
209	4:16:24	4:16:32	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
210	4:17:19	4:17:19	uhhh no
211	4:17:26	4:17:33	IY make
213	4:19:6	4:19:8	IY plane crash 
214	4:20:10	4:20:10	uhm
216	4:21:26	4:21:27	around the bottom of it
217	4:22:59	4:23:7	and
218	4:23:37	4:23:39	ok
219	4:26:29	4:26:33	what 
222	4:36:1	4:36:1	and
223	4:36:27	4:36:34	three inches straight across
224	4:38:3	4:38:3	ok
225	4:38:12	4:38:14	uhm
226	4:40:28	4:40:31	it s right next to it
227	4:41:55	4:42:4	the slate mountain is towards the right
228	4:42:42	4:42:50	and there s a plane crash
229	4:43:51	4:43:54	there s a there s  
230	4:43:55	4:43:55	where IY re going down to a plane crash
231	4:44:36	4:44:38	like four or five inches to the left
235	4:47:13	4:47:20	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
236	4:48:28	4:48:30	no there s no elephants
237	4:50:10	4:50:13	and then
238	4:52:56	4:52:56	and IY re going up like
239	4:56:47	4:56:53	to the lake 
240	4:57:5	4:57:10	uhm
243	4:58:11	4:58:13	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
244	4:58:46	4:58:48	ok well

246	4:59:41	4:59:46	you
248	5:0:5	5:0:14	but
249	5:1:9	5:1:12	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
252	5:3:57	5:4:1	ok IY re at the savannah
253	5:8:13	5:8:13	and IY go to the left a little bit
255	5:14:35	5:14:44	have a s 
256	5:15:19	5:15:20	well
257	5:15:22	5:15:23	to the white mountain
258	5:15:42	5:15:45	what 
259	5:16:52	5:16:58	IY would say
260	5:17:2	5:17:3	yes IY re going towards the lake
261	5:17:22	5:17:31	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
262	5:17:34	5:17:34	like
263	5:18:5	5:18:14	an inch maybe a little bit less
264	5:19:50	5:19:53	five
265	5:19:55	5:19:57	after IY slope down IY d say
267	5:23:47	5:23:51	and it slopes a little bit to the right
268	5:24:29	5:24:29	go up like three  three and a half inches
270	5:27:15	5:27:24	maybe like
271	5:29:27	5:29:32	and then
272	5:29:56	5:29:57	couple miles or something
274	5:33:53	5:33:54	ok well

280	5:39:21	5:39:21	ok
281	5:40:9	5:40:17	and IY re going
282	5:41:3	5:41:6	and then IY slope down to the left
283	5:43:51	5:43:54	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
285	5:46:47	5:46:48	maybe four inches on the paper
286	5:47:6	5:47:14	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
288	5:49:28	5:49:28	IY re starting at the stony desert
289	5:51:40	5:51:45	IY move to the left
291	5:55:28	5:55:28	no
292	5:55:42	5:55:47	like
293	5:56:10	5:56:14	on IY sheet anyway
295	5:57:10	5:57:14	and IY go down IY slope to the right
296	5:57:13	5:57:19	ok
297	5:57:42	5:57:42	IY re going like
299	5:59:26	5:59:32	after plane crash
300	5:59:48	5:59:55	uhm
302	6:0:10	6:0:14	and then IY ll come to a savannah
305	6:6:18	6:6:24	uhm
306	6:6:41	6:6:49	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
307	6:7:57	6:8:1	are IY anywere near there 
309	6:10:5	6:10:8	after that IY go straight again
311	6:16:18	6:16:26	IY slope down again
312	6:17:43	6:17:43	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
314	6:20:13	6:20:17	ok
316	6:21:20	6:21:29	ok
317	6:21:22	6:21:29	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
318	6:22:8	6:22:8	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
319	6:22:16	6:22:24	ok
320	6:22:48	6:22:54	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
321	6:27:7	6:27:10	ok
324	6:30:2	6:30:7	and then
326	6:31:43	6:31:49	ok
327	6:32:11	6:32:20	and IY re sloping to the left
328	6:35:37	6:35:41	so IY make that circle
329	6:37:55	6:37:55	well alright
330	6:38:25	6:38:27	IY re sloping
331	6:40:20	6:40:27	uhm
332	6:41:7	6:41:16	not right at the stony desert
333	6:41:57	6:42:3	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
335	6:44:42	6:44:45	and that s where the plane crash is
336	6:46:8	6:46:8	no IY don t have any rocks
337	6:47:38	6:47:41	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
338	6:48:2	6:48:6	and 
340	6:50:14	6:50:15	and then
341	6:50:39	6:50:48	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
342	6:52:3	6:52:7	uhm
start f
0	0:2:13	0:2:14	ok
10	0:11:8	0:11:15	ok
14	0:23:23	0:23:30	oh
16	0:32:13	0:32:18	IY ve a plane crash though
18	0:33:52	0:33:55	ok
25	0:40:30	0:40:31	yeah
32	0:47:23	0:47:24	IY hit some round rocks

71	1:31:25	1:31:29	ok
84	1:43:50	1:43:58	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
91	1:51:53	1:51:55	yep
96	1:59:9	1:59:16	ok
99	2:3:0	2:3:5	and there s a collapsed shelter
106	2:9:48	2:9:55	uhm IY
107	2:10:36	2:10:37	ok
112	2:13:16	2:13:22	yeah IY see that

116	2:15:41	2:15:44	ok
118	2:17:36	2:17:38	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
122	2:20:9	2:20:10	ok
127	2:22:42	2:22:43	ok
128	2:23:27	2:23:30	mm hmm

140	2:46:10	2:46:15	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
146	2:57:22	2:57:22	mm  mm
150	3:5:46	3:5:55	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
157	3:16:21	3:16:27	to the left
158	3:17:44	3:17:48	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
159	3:17:44	3:17:52	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
160	3:17:56	3:17:59	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
163	3:19:3	3:19:4	how many inches do IY think 
164	3:23:0	3:23:8	and curve down to the left 
168	3:30:40	3:30:41	mm hmm

179	3:42:8	3:42:13	do IY go through anything 
194	3:59:43	3:59:43	do IY go by the plane crash 
196	4:0:55	4:1:4	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
198	4:2:1	4:2:2	up tp the right
202	4:5:54	4:5:56	ok wait hold on
204	4:7:55	4:8:2	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
205	4:8:23	4:8:24	IY m three inches above the savannah
206	4:12:3	4:12:12	yeah
212	4:18:6	4:18:7	ok
215	4:20:44	4:20:44	to the right

254	5:10:51	5:10:52	and to the right 
266	5:22:39	5:22:42	so IY go to the left of the antelope
269	5:27:21	5:27:22	nope IY have a white mountain
273	5:30:23	5:30:24	IY go to a lake 
275	5:37:15	5:37:21	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
276	5:37:21	5:37:24	yeah 
284	5:45:3	5:45:9	IY know IY have different things so
287	5:48:48	5:48:57	so wait

303	6:0:17	6:0:25	mm hmm
304	6:4:28	6:4:29	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
308	6:10:7	6:10:7	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
310	6:15:28	6:15:28	ok
313	6:19:29	6:19:29	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
315	6:21:6	6:21:7	 IY m at the savannah
322	6:27:23	6:27:32	yeah and IY went straight up
323	6:29:59	6:29:59	ok
325	6:31:31	6:31:35	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
334	6:42:54	6:42:55	ok
339	6:49:1	6:49:1	mm hmm
start g
1	0:2:25	0:2:28	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
2	0:3:53	0:3:54	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
3	0:4:31	0:4:40	alright 
4	0:6:48	0:6:52	IY go straight down
5	0:6:57	0:7:4	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
6	0:7:29	0:7:37	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
7	0:8:30	0:8:31	ok
8	0:10:14	0:10:18	alright 
9	0:11:10	0:11:14	and IY re going straight up

15	0:26:22	0:26:29	alright alright well just
17	0:33:16	0:33:21	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
19	0:34:0	0:34:2	and then IY slope up
20	0:35:5	0:35:8	uhm
21	0:35:51	0:35:59	and then
22	0:38:26	0:38:28	IY re kind of going  
23	0:38:36	0:38:36	so that s about IY would say
24	0:39:30	0:39:31	like IY re sloping
26	0:40:37	0:40:37	so anyway
27	0:40:49	0:40:50	IY don t know
28	0:41:21	0:41:29	three inches
29	0:41:55	0:41:56	a little bit too
30	0:44:30	0:44:31	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
31	0:46:15	0:46:20	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
33	0:49:0	0:49:5	uhm
34	0:50:15	0:50:21	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
38	0:56:54	0:57:1	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
40	1:0:4	1:0:6	that s IY little slope
42	1:2:12	1:2:12	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
44	1:3:21	1:3:26	ok 
46	1:4:22	1:4:27	and 
47	1:5:3	1:5:8	well just
48	1:5:46	1:5:54	uhm and there is a stony desert
49	1:6:14	1:6:17	probably the same thing
50	1:6:51	1:6:59	straight up
53	1:13:1	1:13:2	IY re just going down
54	1:16:4	1:16:9	just a slight slope
55	1:16:22	1:16:24	and is to the left
56	1:19:2	1:19:5	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
58	1:19:27	1:19:34	and then IY go straight
60	1:21:58	1:22:6	ok
61	1:22:11	1:22:11	ok
62	1:22:33	1:22:34	hmm
63	1:22:44	1:22:48	and IY slope is about an inch long
64	1:23:53	1:23:53	IY re starting
65	1:24:9	1:24:17	and then
66	1:24:51	1:24:58	uhm
67	1:25:2	1:25:3	are IY  
68	1:29:15	1:29:20	ok
70	1:30:52	1:31:1	and then IY are
72	1:32:20	1:32:25	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
73	1:33:26	1:33:32	couple inches IY re sloping down
74	1:33:55	1:34:2	it s not a big curve
75	1:34:10	1:34:19	about like
76	1:35:23	1:35:29	yes
77	1:36:32	1:36:36	is the plane crash  
78	1:37:42	1:37:43	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
79	1:37:41	1:37:49	IY re actually starting like right
80	1:38:19	1:38:21	ok
81	1:41:34	1:41:38	a little
82	1:42:13	1:42:16	the  
83	1:43:26	1:43:26	to IY right 
85	1:45:57	1:45:58	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
86	1:46:38	1:46:42	maybe IY have different things
87	1:49:1	1:49:3	that s about five or six inches
88	1:50:15	1:50:15	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
89	1:51:0	1:51:6	no IY have  
90	1:51:24	1:51:32	ok
92	1:54:26	1:54:33	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
93	1:56:6	1:56:14	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
94	1:58:21	1:58:24	ok IY plane crash isn t there
95	1:59:10	1:59:14	well
97	2:1:2	2:1:2	for about two inches
98	2:2:27	2:2:27	ok
100	2:3:18	2:3:22	ok
101	2:4:9	2:4:17	ok
102	2:6:44	2:6:45	IY re going about
103	2:7:5	2:7:6	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
104	2:7:14	2:7:23	a quarter of an inch
105	2:8:26	2:8:27	and then IY go
108	2:10:42	2:10:46	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
109	2:10:48	2:10:52	ok
110	2:11:10	2:11:19	and then IY re going down
111	2:12:35	2:12:42	slight
113	2:13:46	2:13:49	and IY just go straight up
114	2:15:1	2:15:1	are IY in like   
117	2:15:44	2:15:53	and then
119	2:18:2	2:18:10	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
120	2:19:40	2:19:47	to the right
121	2:20:7	2:20:7	from
123	2:20:20	2:20:26	then
124	2:21:48	2:21:53	so

126	2:22:23	2:22:29	uhm
129	2:26:15	2:26:24	to the left
130	2:27:0	2:27:1	and IY should have a straight line there
131	2:27:40	2:27:47	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
133	2:28:1	2:28:9	uhm
134	2:29:37	2:29:43	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
137	2:38:54	2:38:55	for like
138	2:39:23	2:39:26	IY wanna kind of curve
139	2:42:48	2:42:50	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
141	2:46:27	2:46:29	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
142	2:49:42	2:49:42	no IY don t have a waterhole
143	2:55:47	2:55:50	like
144	2:56:21	2:56:25	IY got that 
145	2:56:36	2:56:41	just do it like this ok
147	2:58:17	2:58:17	four or five inches to the left
148	3:3:6	3:3:7	uhm
149	3:4:20	3:4:26	and then IY slope
151	3:5:58	3:5:59	like maybe an inch
152	3:6:55	3:7:1	uhm
153	3:10:32	3:10:35	so IY go three inches straight
154	3:12:39	3:12:47	IY re at the plane crash
155	3:12:59	3:13:6	no
156	3:13:21	3:13:27	maybe
161	3:18:5	3:18:12	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
162	3:18:16	3:18:17	ok
165	3:23:38	3:23:45	maybe like
166	3:25:36	3:25:41	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
167	3:27:9	3:27:16	and then IY  IY go up
170	3:31:5	3:31:9	like three inches 
171	3:32:6	3:32:6	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
174	3:32:46	3:32:52	like an inch
176	3:38:33	3:38:36	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
178	3:41:43	3:41:46	ok and then IY re going
180	3:44:25	3:44:33	ok
181	3:47:32	3:47:37	uhm
182	3:52:10	3:52:14	alright are IY starting  near the  
183	3:54:27	3:54:27	ok
184	3:54:32	3:54:34	they re there
185	3:54:43	3:54:43	ok
186	3:54:53	3:54:54	to the left
187	3:55:18	3:55:20	alright well IY ll keep going and see
188	3:55:24	3:55:33	IY just kind of slope down
189	3:56:26	3:56:34	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
190	3:56:40	3:56:41	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
191	3:57:24	3:57:31	like
192	3:59:6	3:59:9	do IY have roman baths 
193	3:59:9	3:59:15	are IY anywhere near there 
195	4:0:33	4:0:38	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
197	4:1:41	4:1:42	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
199	4:3:47	4:3:50	after the circle
200	4:4:27	4:4:35	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
201	4:5:26	4:5:33	to the left
203	4:6:30	4:6:34	are IY in like almost the top of the
207	4:13:36	4:13:39	kind of across from stony desert
208	4:14:33	4:14:42	so IY re at the hot springs
209	4:16:24	4:16:32	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
210	4:17:19	4:17:19	uhhh no
211	4:17:26	4:17:33	IY make
213	4:19:6	4:19:8	IY plane crash 
214	4:20:10	4:20:10	uhm
216	4:21:26	4:21:27	around the bottom of it
217	4:22:59	4:23:7	and

226	4:40:28	4:40:31	it s right next to it
227	4:41:55	4:42:4	the slate mountain is towards the right
228	4:42:42	4:42:50	and there s a plane crash
229	4:43:51	4:43:54	there s a there s  
230	4:43:55	4:43:55	where IY re going down to a plane crash
231	4:44:36	4:44:38	like four or five inches to the left
235	4:47:13	4:47:20	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
236	4:48:28	4:48:30	no there s no elephants
237	4:50:10	4:50:13	and then
238	4:52:56	4:52:56	and IY re going up like
239	4:56:47	4:56:53	to the lake 
240	4:57:5	4:57:10	uhm
243	4:58:11	4:58:13	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
244	4:58:46	4:58:48	ok well

248	5:0:5	5:0:14	but
249	5:1:9	5:1:12	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
252	5:3:57	5:4:1	ok IY re at the savannah
253	5:8:13	5:8:13	and IY go to the left a little bit
255	5:14:35	5:14:44	have a s 
256	5:15:19	5:15:20	well
257	5:15:22	5:15:23	to the white mountain

259	5:16:52	5:16:58	IY would say
260	5:17:2	5:17:3	yes IY re going towards the lake
261	5:17:22	5:17:31	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
262	5:17:34	5:17:34	like
263	5:18:5	5:18:14	an inch maybe a little bit less
264	5:19:50	5:19:53	five
265	5:19:55	5:19:57	after IY slope down IY d say
267	5:23:47	5:23:51	and it slopes a little bit to the right
268	5:24:29	5:24:29	go up like three  three and a half inches

281	5:40:9	5:40:17	and IY re going
282	5:41:3	5:41:6	and then IY slope down to the left
283	5:43:51	5:43:54	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
285	5:46:47	5:46:48	maybe four inches on the paper
286	5:47:6	5:47:14	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
288	5:49:28	5:49:28	IY re starting at the stony desert
289	5:51:40	5:51:45	IY move to the left
291	5:55:28	5:55:28	no
292	5:55:42	5:55:47	like
293	5:56:10	5:56:14	on IY sheet anyway
295	5:57:10	5:57:14	and IY go down IY slope to the right
296	5:57:13	5:57:19	ok
297	5:57:42	5:57:42	IY re going like
299	5:59:26	5:59:32	after plane crash
300	5:59:48	5:59:55	uhm
302	6:0:10	6:0:14	and then IY ll come to a savannah
305	6:6:18	6:6:24	uhm
306	6:6:41	6:6:49	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
307	6:7:57	6:8:1	are IY anywere near there 
309	6:10:5	6:10:8	after that IY go straight again
311	6:16:18	6:16:26	IY slope down again
312	6:17:43	6:17:43	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
314	6:20:13	6:20:17	ok
316	6:21:20	6:21:29	ok
317	6:21:22	6:21:29	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
318	6:22:8	6:22:8	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
319	6:22:16	6:22:24	ok
320	6:22:48	6:22:54	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything

326	6:31:43	6:31:49	ok
327	6:32:11	6:32:20	and IY re sloping to the left
328	6:35:37	6:35:41	so IY make that circle
329	6:37:55	6:37:55	well alright
