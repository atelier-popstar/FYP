start
start g
0	0:0:30	0:0:38	and then IY slope down to the left
1	0:1:52	0:1:57	to the right
2	0:2:41	0:2:43	and IY go to the left a little bit
3	0:2:42	0:2:45	like IY re sloping
4	0:4:7	0:4:12	and is to the left
5	0:4:24	0:4:24	are IY in like   
6	0:6:30	0:6:36	five
7	0:7:15	0:7:19	uhm
8	0:8:16	0:8:18	and then
10	0:12:27	0:12:30	not right at the stony desert
12	0:13:40	0:13:45	IY re starting
13	0:15:6	0:15:15	are IY in like almost the top of the
14	0:15:48	0:15:50	ok
15	0:16:10	0:16:15	no IY have  
16	0:16:25	0:16:30	you
17	0:17:3	0:17:4	no
18	0:17:21	0:17:24	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
19	0:19:15	0:19:18	after the circle
20	0:19:28	0:19:35	and then
21	0:19:45	0:19:49	and
22	0:20:22	0:20:26	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
25	0:24:48	0:24:56	it s not a big curve
26	0:25:8	0:25:15	hmm
27	0:26:48	0:26:53	and then IY go straight
28	0:28:12	0:28:20	IY wanna kind of curve
29	0:29:6	0:29:11	and then IY ll come to a savannah
30	0:30:8	0:30:10	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
32	0:31:42	0:31:45	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
34	0:33:16	0:33:18	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
37	0:35:4	0:35:8	uhm
38	0:36:25	0:36:28	and then
39	0:36:43	0:36:51	where IY re going down to a plane crash
40	0:36:47	0:36:54	ok
41	0:37:29	0:37:36	probably the same thing
42	0:39:6	0:39:9	like an inch
43	0:40:27	0:40:35	alright well IY ll keep going and see
44	0:44:2	0:44:4	and 
45	0:44:18	0:44:20	and then
46	0:44:28	0:44:30	ok

50	0:49:17	0:49:21	ok
51	0:51:59	0:52:5	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
52	0:52:38	0:52:41	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
53	0:52:49	0:52:50	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
55	0:53:36	0:53:37	ok
57	0:59:5	0:59:14	IY go straight down
58	1:1:12	1:1:17	ok
60	1:8:29	1:8:33	and IY just go straight up
63	1:16:47	1:16:51	yes IY re going towards the lake
64	1:17:56	1:18:0	uhhh no
65	1:20:18	1:20:25	uhm
67	1:20:44	1:20:50	are IY anywere near there 
70	1:22:33	1:22:35	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
71	1:22:44	1:22:53	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
72	1:26:22	1:26:25	do IY have roman baths 
75	1:28:2	1:28:2	so IY re at the hot springs
76	1:29:9	1:29:13	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
77	1:31:53	1:31:57	is the plane crash  
78	1:32:31	1:32:40	and then
79	1:33:1	1:33:5	slight
80	1:33:0	1:33:9	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
81	1:37:37	1:37:43	ok
82	1:40:5	1:40:9	maybe like
83	1:40:55	1:41:3	ok
85	1:41:17	1:41:26	on IY sheet anyway

103	1:53:11	1:53:12	ok well
104	1:53:57	1:54:1	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
106	1:59:45	1:59:52	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
108	2:5:27	2:5:35	maybe four inches on the paper
109	2:6:39	2:6:43	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
110	2:6:44	2:6:45	and it slopes a little bit to the right
111	2:7:57	2:8:5	and
112	2:8:15	2:8:20	to the lake 
113	2:9:41	2:9:41	so anyway
114	2:9:33	2:9:42	uhm
115	2:11:40	2:11:40	ok IY plane crash isn t there
118	2:14:18	2:14:18	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
119	2:14:37	2:14:38	IY make
120	2:15:56	2:16:1	IY re kind of going  
122	2:18:50	2:18:51	uhm
123	2:20:20	2:20:20	what 
124	2:20:15	2:20:22	IY re going about
125	2:22:31	2:22:37	what 
128	2:30:36	2:30:44	then
129	2:32:34	2:32:35	go up like three  three and a half inches
130	2:34:11	2:34:19	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
131	2:35:47	2:35:52	alright are IY starting  near the  
132	2:35:49	2:35:57	ok
134	2:36:10	2:36:17	and then IY go
135	2:39:50	2:39:50	IY re actually starting like right
136	2:44:57	2:45:3	after plane crash
138	2:48:19	2:48:21	uhm
140	2:48:21	2:48:28	are IY  
141	2:50:28	2:50:30	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
143	2:56:14	2:56:22	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
145	2:58:32	2:58:39	ok
146	2:59:4	2:59:9	to the white mountain
147	2:59:56	3:0:3	and then
148	2:59:55	3:0:4	ok and then IY re going
149	3:3:4	3:3:8	IY re just going down
152	3:6:24	3:6:30	maybe like
153	3:7:30	3:7:31	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
154	3:7:28	3:7:35	IY would say
157	3:11:32	3:11:40	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
158	3:14:9	3:14:12	IY re going like
159	3:15:1	3:15:1	and IY re going
160	3:17:44	3:17:50	yes
162	3:19:31	3:19:37	alright 
164	3:20:7	3:20:12	after IY slope down IY d say
165	3:20:41	3:20:46	it s right next to it
166	3:20:47	3:20:55	maybe
168	3:22:24	3:22:29	and IY re going up like
169	3:23:19	3:23:26	uh like
171	3:27:8	3:27:11	and IY should have a straight line there
172	3:27:5	3:27:13	IY slope down again
173	3:29:1	3:29:1	no IY don t have a waterhole
174	3:32:3	3:32:3	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
175	3:32:18	3:32:25	like maybe an inch
176	3:32:36	3:32:38	and then IY re going down
177	3:35:38	3:35:40	ok well
178	3:39:10	3:39:16	so that s about IY would say
179	3:41:44	3:41:44	the slate mountain is towards the right
180	3:43:15	3:43:23	uhm
181	3:43:16	3:43:23	well
182	3:45:53	3:45:56	and then IY  IY go up
184	3:48:31	3:48:36	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
185	3:48:48	3:48:52	straight up
187	3:49:50	3:49:59	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
188	3:50:44	3:50:47	and IY re sloping to the left
190	3:56:46	3:56:46	and then
191	3:56:45	3:56:50	ok
192	3:58:27	3:58:34	couple miles or something
193	3:58:44	3:58:46	three inches
194	4:0:2	4:0:4	uhm
196	4:1:19	4:1:19	ok
197	4:2:1	4:2:2	ok
198	4:3:44	4:3:50	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
199	4:4:4	4:4:4	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
200	4:3:59	4:4:6	couple inches IY re sloping down
202	4:7:5	4:7:6	so
203	4:7:26	4:7:32	three inches straight across
205	4:7:50	4:7:55	ok
207	4:10:9	4:10:17	that s IY little slope
208	4:12:7	4:12:7	from
209	4:12:41	4:12:49	ok
210	4:14:3	4:14:9	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
211	4:14:22	4:14:22	a quarter of an inch
212	4:15:13	4:15:20	and then IY slope
213	4:15:16	4:15:21	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
214	4:15:21	4:15:23	four or five inches to the left
216	4:19:50	4:19:56	uhm
219	4:23:38	4:23:41	and then IY slope up
222	4:29:3	4:29:4	ok IY re at the savannah
223	4:29:4	4:29:9	after that IY go straight again
224	4:30:15	4:30:21	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
227	4:34:8	4:34:14	maybe IY have different things
228	4:34:26	4:34:32	IY don t know
231	4:36:28	4:36:31	are IY anywhere near there 
232	4:37:27	4:37:31	uhm
234	4:43:39	4:43:42	three inches
235	4:45:0	4:45:5	ok 
236	4:46:19	4:46:22	about like
237	4:49:9	4:49:14	and IY re going straight up
238	4:50:4	4:50:6	IY plane crash 
239	4:50:27	4:50:28	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
240	4:50:40	4:50:41	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
241	4:50:41	4:50:47	just do it like this ok
242	4:51:57	4:52:5	the  
243	4:52:14	4:52:23	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
244	4:53:28	4:53:32	so IY make that circle
246	4:54:34	4:54:40	like four or five inches to the left
249	4:56:52	4:56:54	IY just kind of slope down
250	4:58:15	4:58:20	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
251	4:58:44	4:58:46	ok
253	5:1:26	5:1:26	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
255	5:3:31	5:3:39	uhm
256	5:8:39	5:8:40	well just
257	5:8:54	5:8:55	IY re sloping
258	5:9:38	5:9:42	for like
259	5:10:22	5:10:24	and there s a plane crash
261	5:13:26	5:13:30	a little
262	5:13:23	5:13:30	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
265	5:15:32	5:15:37	uhm and there is a stony desert
266	5:15:45	5:15:51	uhm
268	5:18:48	5:18:49	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
269	5:19:5	5:19:12	like
270	5:19:56	5:19:56	ok
272	5:21:13	5:21:17	kind of across from stony desert
273	5:24:53	5:24:57	like
276	5:30:36	5:30:45	ok
278	5:32:22	5:32:29	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
282	5:37:56	5:37:56	IY re starting at the stony desert
283	5:38:0	5:38:3	uhm
285	5:41:2	5:41:3	and then IY are
286	5:41:9	5:41:12	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
288	5:43:58	5:44:0	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
289	5:46:54	5:47:1	and IY go down IY slope to the right
290	5:47:22	5:47:27	IY move to the left
291	5:48:49	5:48:56	and IY slope is about an inch long
292	5:49:0	5:49:4	uhm
293	5:50:56	5:51:3	for like
295	5:51:46	5:51:55	IY got that 
296	5:52:29	5:52:30	a little bit too
298	5:55:12	5:55:15	but
301	5:58:10	5:58:16	yes

303	6:2:18	6:2:21	uhm
306	6:7:35	6:7:42	well
307	6:8:6	6:8:7	to IY right 
308	6:8:51	6:8:51	alright 
309	6:12:7	6:12:11	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
310	6:12:19	6:12:22	ok
311	6:14:9	6:14:14	an inch maybe a little bit less
312	6:14:34	6:14:43	uhm
313	6:15:33	6:15:36	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
314	6:15:40	6:15:40	and that s where the plane crash is
315	6:15:48	6:15:51	ok
316	6:16:17	6:16:26	no IY don t have any rocks
317	6:17:17	6:17:19	like three inches 
318	6:20:11	6:20:12	so IY go three inches straight
319	6:21:55	6:21:58	ok
321	6:24:9	6:24:18	for about two inches
322	6:24:18	6:24:19	have a s 
325	6:25:57	6:25:59	IY re at the plane crash
326	6:27:13	6:27:18	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
328	6:30:1	6:30:5	to the left
330	6:34:56	6:35:0	just a slight slope
331	6:35:1	6:35:7	no there s no elephants
332	6:36:21	6:36:23	and then IY slope just kind of gradually evens out for like an inch as IY re going by the hot wells
334	6:41:29	6:41:35	like
335	6:45:13	6:45:21	ok
336	6:45:45	6:45:48	so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start
337	6:45:59	6:46:7	so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
338	6:47:23	6:47:31	well alright
339	6:48:13	6:48:22	around the bottom of it
340	6:48:53	6:48:53	but it s like a slight slope to the right as IY re going up but it s steep
341	6:49:38	6:49:40	IY have a waterhole on IY map 
342	6:50:21	6:50:25	ok and then as IY re passing the white mountain
start f
9	0:8:15	0:8:22	yeah IY see that
11	0:12:35	0:12:44	to the left
23	0:21:56	0:22:0	yeah

47	0:46:20	0:46:28	ok
54	0:52:54	0:52:59	IY ve a plane crash though
56	0:56:45	0:56:45	and curve down to the left 
59	1:3:39	1:3:48	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
61	1:10:54	1:10:54	mm hmm
62	1:14:35	1:14:42	yeah and IY went straight up
66	1:20:45	1:20:50	ok

69	1:21:44	1:21:53	ok
73	1:26:43	1:26:43	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
74	1:27:50	1:27:58	so wait
84	1:41:18	1:41:23	ok
86	1:42:54	1:43:2	uh IY don t know know what to say

102	1:52:53	1:52:57	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
105	1:54:2	1:54:6	mm hmm
107	2:0:46	2:0:46	elephants

156	3:8:57	3:9:2	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
161	3:19:17	3:19:20	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
163	3:19:43	3:19:46	ok
167	3:22:9	3:22:18	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
170	3:24:4	3:24:4	yep
183	3:47:25	3:47:27	ok
186	3:49:8	3:49:8	ok
189	3:52:11	3:52:20	mm  mm

201	4:5:32	4:5:34	to the right 
204	4:7:49	4:7:55	mm hmm
206	4:8:39	4:8:42	ok
215	4:19:24	4:19:30	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
217	4:19:58	4:20:1	nope
218	4:22:8	4:22:11	around the lake to the top 
220	4:25:6	4:25:6	oh
221	4:27:21	4:27:27	ok
225	4:30:17	4:30:24	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now

267	5:18:36	5:18:36	ok
271	5:20:16	5:20:25	IY m three inches above the savannah
274	5:29:20	5:29:21	ok wait hold on
275	5:30:7	5:30:16	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
277	5:30:58	5:31:2	ok
279	5:35:17	5:35:21	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
280	5:35:33	5:35:38	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
281	5:35:35	5:35:39	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
284	5:40:9	5:40:12	ok
287	5:41:17	5:41:19	how many inches do IY think 
294	5:51:4	5:51:7	nope IY have a white mountain
297	5:53:39	5:53:48	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
299	5:56:32	5:56:32	yeah 
300	5:57:19	5:57:26	to 
304	6:2:34	6:2:38	do IY go around it

327	6:28:43	6:28:49	IY go to a lake 
329	6:32:21	6:32:21	to the left of the antelope
333	6:40:14	6:40:14	yeah
start g
0	0:0:30	0:0:38	and then IY slope down to the left
1	0:1:52	0:1:57	to the right
2	0:2:41	0:2:43	and IY go to the left a little bit
3	0:2:42	0:2:45	like IY re sloping
4	0:4:7	0:4:12	and is to the left
5	0:4:24	0:4:24	are IY in like   
6	0:6:30	0:6:36	five
7	0:7:15	0:7:19	uhm
8	0:8:16	0:8:18	and then
10	0:12:27	0:12:30	not right at the stony desert
12	0:13:40	0:13:45	IY re starting
13	0:15:6	0:15:15	are IY in like almost the top of the
14	0:15:48	0:15:50	ok

18	0:17:21	0:17:24	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
19	0:19:15	0:19:18	after the circle
20	0:19:28	0:19:35	and then
21	0:19:45	0:19:49	and
22	0:20:22	0:20:26	aways about like four inches  four or five inches

26	0:25:8	0:25:15	hmm
27	0:26:48	0:26:53	and then IY go straight
28	0:28:12	0:28:20	IY wanna kind of curve
29	0:29:6	0:29:11	and then IY ll come to a savannah
30	0:30:8	0:30:10	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
32	0:31:42	0:31:45	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
34	0:33:16	0:33:18	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
37	0:35:4	0:35:8	uhm
38	0:36:25	0:36:28	and then
39	0:36:43	0:36:51	where IY re going down to a plane crash
40	0:36:47	0:36:54	ok
41	0:37:29	0:37:36	probably the same thing
42	0:39:6	0:39:9	like an inch

50	0:49:17	0:49:21	ok
51	0:51:59	0:52:5	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
52	0:52:38	0:52:41	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
53	0:52:49	0:52:50	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
55	0:53:36	0:53:37	ok
57	0:59:5	0:59:14	IY go straight down
58	1:1:12	1:1:17	ok
60	1:8:29	1:8:33	and IY just go straight up
63	1:16:47	1:16:51	yes IY re going towards the lake
64	1:17:56	1:18:0	uhhh no
65	1:20:18	1:20:25	uhm
67	1:20:44	1:20:50	are IY anywere near there 
70	1:22:33	1:22:35	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
71	1:22:44	1:22:53	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
72	1:26:22	1:26:25	do IY have roman baths 
75	1:28:2	1:28:2	so IY re at the hot springs
76	1:29:9	1:29:13	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
77	1:31:53	1:31:57	is the plane crash  
78	1:32:31	1:32:40	and then
79	1:33:1	1:33:5	slight
80	1:33:0	1:33:9	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
81	1:37:37	1:37:43	ok
82	1:40:5	1:40:9	maybe like
83	1:40:55	1:41:3	ok

103	1:53:11	1:53:12	ok well
104	1:53:57	1:54:1	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
106	1:59:45	1:59:52	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
108	2:5:27	2:5:35	maybe four inches on the paper
109	2:6:39	2:6:43	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
110	2:6:44	2:6:45	and it slopes a little bit to the right
111	2:7:57	2:8:5	and
112	2:8:15	2:8:20	to the lake 
113	2:9:41	2:9:41	so anyway
114	2:9:33	2:9:42	uhm
115	2:11:40	2:11:40	ok IY plane crash isn t there
118	2:14:18	2:14:18	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
119	2:14:37	2:14:38	IY make
120	2:15:56	2:16:1	IY re kind of going  
122	2:18:50	2:18:51	uhm

129	2:32:34	2:32:35	go up like three  three and a half inches
130	2:34:11	2:34:19	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
131	2:35:47	2:35:52	alright are IY starting  near the  
132	2:35:49	2:35:57	ok
134	2:36:10	2:36:17	and then IY go
135	2:39:50	2:39:50	IY re actually starting like right
136	2:44:57	2:45:3	after plane crash
138	2:48:19	2:48:21	uhm
140	2:48:21	2:48:28	are IY  
141	2:50:28	2:50:30	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
143	2:56:14	2:56:22	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
145	2:58:32	2:58:39	ok
146	2:59:4	2:59:9	to the white mountain
147	2:59:56	3:0:3	and then

154	3:7:28	3:7:35	IY would say
157	3:11:32	3:11:40	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope

159	3:15:1	3:15:1	and IY re going
160	3:17:44	3:17:50	yes
162	3:19:31	3:19:37	alright 
164	3:20:7	3:20:12	after IY slope down IY d say
165	3:20:41	3:20:46	it s right next to it
166	3:20:47	3:20:55	maybe
168	3:22:24	3:22:29	and IY re going up like
169	3:23:19	3:23:26	uh like
171	3:27:8	3:27:11	and IY should have a straight line there
172	3:27:5	3:27:13	IY slope down again
173	3:29:1	3:29:1	no IY don t have a waterhole
174	3:32:3	3:32:3	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
175	3:32:18	3:32:25	like maybe an inch
176	3:32:36	3:32:38	and then IY re going down
177	3:35:38	3:35:40	ok well
178	3:39:10	3:39:16	so that s about IY would say
179	3:41:44	3:41:44	the slate mountain is towards the right
180	3:43:15	3:43:23	uhm
181	3:43:16	3:43:23	well
182	3:45:53	3:45:56	and then IY  IY go up
184	3:48:31	3:48:36	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
185	3:48:48	3:48:52	straight up
187	3:49:50	3:49:59	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
188	3:50:44	3:50:47	and IY re sloping to the left
190	3:56:46	3:56:46	and then
191	3:56:45	3:56:50	ok
192	3:58:27	3:58:34	couple miles or something

197	4:2:1	4:2:2	ok
198	4:3:44	4:3:50	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
199	4:4:4	4:4:4	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
200	4:3:59	4:4:6	couple inches IY re sloping down
202	4:7:5	4:7:6	so
203	4:7:26	4:7:32	three inches straight across
205	4:7:50	4:7:55	ok
207	4:10:9	4:10:17	that s IY little slope
208	4:12:7	4:12:7	from
209	4:12:41	4:12:49	ok
210	4:14:3	4:14:9	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
211	4:14:22	4:14:22	a quarter of an inch
212	4:15:13	4:15:20	and then IY slope
213	4:15:16	4:15:21	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
214	4:15:21	4:15:23	four or five inches to the left
216	4:19:50	4:19:56	uhm
219	4:23:38	4:23:41	and then IY slope up
222	4:29:3	4:29:4	ok IY re at the savannah
223	4:29:4	4:29:9	after that IY go straight again
224	4:30:15	4:30:21	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
227	4:34:8	4:34:14	maybe IY have different things
228	4:34:26	4:34:32	IY don t know
231	4:36:28	4:36:31	are IY anywhere near there 
232	4:37:27	4:37:31	uhm
234	4:43:39	4:43:42	three inches
235	4:45:0	4:45:5	ok 
236	4:46:19	4:46:22	about like
237	4:49:9	4:49:14	and IY re going straight up
238	4:50:4	4:50:6	IY plane crash 
239	4:50:27	4:50:28	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
240	4:50:40	4:50:41	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
241	4:50:41	4:50:47	just do it like this ok
242	4:51:57	4:52:5	the  
243	4:52:14	4:52:23	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
244	4:53:28	4:53:32	so IY make that circle
246	4:54:34	4:54:40	like four or five inches to the left
249	4:56:52	4:56:54	IY just kind of slope down
250	4:58:15	4:58:20	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
251	4:58:44	4:58:46	ok
253	5:1:26	5:1:26	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
255	5:3:31	5:3:39	uhm
256	5:8:39	5:8:40	well just
257	5:8:54	5:8:55	IY re sloping
258	5:9:38	5:9:42	for like
259	5:10:22	5:10:24	and there s a plane crash
261	5:13:26	5:13:30	a little
262	5:13:23	5:13:30	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
265	5:15:32	5:15:37	uhm and there is a stony desert
266	5:15:45	5:15:51	uhm
268	5:18:48	5:18:49	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
269	5:19:5	5:19:12	like
270	5:19:56	5:19:56	ok
272	5:21:13	5:21:17	kind of across from stony desert
273	5:24:53	5:24:57	like
276	5:30:36	5:30:45	ok
278	5:32:22	5:32:29	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
282	5:37:56	5:37:56	IY re starting at the stony desert
283	5:38:0	5:38:3	uhm
285	5:41:2	5:41:3	and then IY are
286	5:41:9	5:41:12	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
288	5:43:58	5:44:0	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
289	5:46:54	5:47:1	and IY go down IY slope to the right
290	5:47:22	5:47:27	IY move to the left
291	5:48:49	5:48:56	and IY slope is about an inch long
292	5:49:0	5:49:4	uhm
293	5:50:56	5:51:3	for like
295	5:51:46	5:51:55	IY got that 
296	5:52:29	5:52:30	a little bit too
298	5:55:12	5:55:15	but
301	5:58:10	5:58:16	yes
302	5:58:41	5:58:48	and 
303	6:2:18	6:2:21	uhm
306	6:7:35	6:7:42	well
307	6:8:6	6:8:7	to IY right 
308	6:8:51	6:8:51	alright 
309	6:12:7	6:12:11	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
310	6:12:19	6:12:22	ok
311	6:14:9	6:14:14	an inch maybe a little bit less
312	6:14:34	6:14:43	uhm
313	6:15:33	6:15:36	yes yeah IY just don t even go near there
314	6:15:40	6:15:40	and that s where the plane crash is
315	6:15:48	6:15:51	ok
316	6:16:17	6:16:26	no IY don t have any rocks
317	6:17:17	6:17:19	like three inches 
318	6:20:11	6:20:12	so IY go three inches straight
319	6:21:55	6:21:58	ok
321	6:24:9	6:24:18	for about two inches
322	6:24:18	6:24:19	have a s 
325	6:25:57	6:25:59	IY re at the plane crash
326	6:27:13	6:27:18	IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit
328	6:30:1	6:30:5	to the left
330	6:34:56	6:35:0	just a slight slope
