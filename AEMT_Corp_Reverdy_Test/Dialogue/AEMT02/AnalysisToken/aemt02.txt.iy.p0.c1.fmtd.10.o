start
0:0:30	0:0:38	g	and then IY slope down to the left
0:1:52	0:1:57	g	to the right
0:2:41	0:2:43	g	and IY go to the left a little bit
0:2:42	0:2:45	g	like IY re sloping
0:4:7	0:4:12	g	and is to the left
0:4:24	0:4:24	g	are IY in like   
0:6:30	0:6:36	g	five
0:7:15	0:7:19	g	uhm
0:8:16	0:8:18	g	and then
0:8:15	0:8:22	f	yeah IY see that
0:12:27	0:12:30	g	not right at the stony desert
0:12:35	0:12:44	f	to the left
0:13:40	0:13:45	g	IY re starting
0:15:6	0:15:15	g	are IY in like almost the top of the
0:15:48	0:15:50	g	ok
0:16:10	0:16:15	g	no IY have  
0:16:25	0:16:30	g	you
0:17:3	0:17:4	g	no
0:17:21	0:17:24	g	in those three inches IY re kind of curving to te right but it s a slight curve
0:19:15	0:19:18	g	after the circle
0:19:28	0:19:35	g	and then
0:19:45	0:19:49	g	and
0:20:22	0:20:26	g	aways about like four inches  four or five inches
0:21:56	0:22:0	f	yeah
0:22:51	0:22:58	f	am IY supposed to start at the same place 
0:24:48	0:24:56	g	it s not a big curve
0:25:8	0:25:15	g	hmm
0:26:48	0:26:53	g	and then IY go straight
0:28:12	0:28:20	g	IY wanna kind of curve
0:29:6	0:29:11	g	and then IY ll come to a savannah
0:30:8	0:30:10	g	right next to IY circle should be roman baths
0:31:9	0:31:9	f	yeah
0:31:42	0:31:45	g	and there  do IY have any like antelope or anything 
0:32:1	0:32:3	f	ok
0:33:16	0:33:18	g	IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
0:33:19	0:33:19	f	ok
0:34:44	0:34:53	f	it s not like in the same place that IY re describing 
0:35:4	0:35:8	g	uhm
0:36:25	0:36:28	g	and then
0:36:43	0:36:51	g	where IY re going down to a plane crash
0:36:47	0:36:54	g	ok
0:37:29	0:37:36	g	probably the same thing
0:39:6	0:39:9	g	like an inch
0:40:27	0:40:35	g	alright well IY ll keep going and see
0:44:2	0:44:4	g	and 
0:44:18	0:44:20	g	and then
0:44:28	0:44:30	g	ok

0:47:12	0:47:19	g	no
0:48:44	0:48:44	g	ok
0:49:17	0:49:21	g	ok
0:51:59	0:52:5	g	like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
0:52:38	0:52:41	g	and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
0:52:49	0:52:50	g	where are IY right now   start at the savannah
0:52:54	0:52:59	f	IY ve a plane crash though
0:53:36	0:53:37	g	ok
0:56:45	0:56:45	f	and curve down to the left 
0:59:5	0:59:14	g	IY go straight down
1:1:12	1:1:17	g	ok
1:3:39	1:3:48	f	so IY pass a waterhole or no 
1:8:29	1:8:33	g	and IY just go straight up
1:10:54	1:10:54	f	mm hmm
1:14:35	1:14:42	f	yeah and IY went straight up
1:16:47	1:16:51	g	yes IY re going towards the lake
1:17:56	1:18:0	g	uhhh no
1:20:18	1:20:25	g	uhm
1:20:45	1:20:50	f	ok

1:21:44	1:21:53	f	ok
1:22:33	1:22:35	g	it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
1:22:44	1:22:53	g	and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
1:26:22	1:26:25	g	do IY have roman baths 
1:26:43	1:26:43	f	am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
1:27:50	1:27:58	f	so wait
1:28:2	1:28:2	g	so IY re at the hot springs
1:29:9	1:29:13	g	as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
1:31:53	1:31:57	g	is the plane crash  
1:32:31	1:32:40	g	and then
1:33:1	1:33:5	g	slight
1:33:0	1:33:9	g	IY go like straight for about three inches but it s like a s  
1:37:37	1:37:43	g	ok
1:40:5	1:40:9	g	maybe like
1:40:55	1:41:3	g	ok
1:41:18	1:41:23	f	ok

1:46:41	1:46:44	g	and then
1:48:9	1:48:15	f	IY ve that plane crash that IY were talking about earlier that s up there
1:48:25	1:48:26	g	ok
1:50:6	1:50:13	g	to the left
1:52:21	1:52:25	f	do IY go by the plane crash 
1:52:53	1:52:57	f	do IY hit anything when IY go down 
1:53:11	1:53:12	g	ok well
1:53:57	1:54:1	g	to the left of IY little path    where IY path should be
1:54:2	1:54:6	f	mm hmm
1:59:45	1:59:52	g	maybe an inch and a half    two  inches
2:0:46	2:0:46	f	elephants 
2:5:27	2:5:35	g	maybe four inches on the paper
2:6:39	2:6:43	g	yeah around the top of the lake and the lake s like in a circle and IY kinda make like a circle
2:6:44	2:6:45	g	and it slopes a little bit to the right
2:7:57	2:8:5	g	and
2:8:15	2:8:20	g	to the lake 
2:9:41	2:9:41	g	so anyway
2:9:33	2:9:42	g	uhm
2:11:40	2:11:40	g	ok IY plane crash isn t there
2:13:3	2:13:12	f	up tp the right
2:14:13	2:14:16	f	IY have to back up a little bit
2:14:18	2:14:18	g	the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
2:14:37	2:14:38	g	IY make
2:15:56	2:16:1	g	IY re kind of going  
2:18:28	2:18:29	f	ok
2:18:50	2:18:51	g	uhm

2:24:59	2:25:2	f	ok
2:28:51	2:29:0	f	ok
2:30:36	2:30:44	g	then
2:32:34	2:32:35	g	go up like three  three and a half inches
2:34:11	2:34:19	g	and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
2:35:47	2:35:52	g	alright are IY starting  near the  
2:35:49	2:35:57	g	ok
2:36:7	2:36:15	f	IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
2:36:10	2:36:17	g	and then IY go
2:39:50	2:39:50	g	IY re actually starting like right
2:44:57	2:45:3	g	after plane crash
2:46:18	2:46:21	f	ok
2:48:19	2:48:21	g	uhm
2:48:16	2:48:23	f	ok
2:48:21	2:48:28	g	are IY  
2:50:28	2:50:30	g	and then IY re up straight and IY ve gone the two inches
2:55:48	2:55:54	f	IY know IY have different things so
2:56:14	2:56:22	g	IY re not through anything yet IY re going actually around the lake
2:58:17	2:58:25	f	so IY go to the left of the antelope
2:58:32	2:58:39	g	ok
2:59:4	2:59:9	g	to the white mountain
2:59:56	3:0:3	g	and then
2:59:55	3:0:4	g	ok and then IY re going
3:3:4	3:3:8	g	IY re just going down
3:4:17	3:4:22	f	ok
3:6:3	3:6:7	f	ok
3:6:24	3:6:30	g	maybe like
3:7:30	3:7:31	g	and IY go around the lake and the lake s kinda like in a s  
3:7:28	3:7:35	g	IY would say
3:8:42	3:8:43	f	do IY go through anything 
3:8:57	3:9:2	f	up diagonally to the right of the antelope
3:11:32	3:11:40	g	no the  IY go to the left of the antelope
3:14:9	3:14:12	g	IY re going like
3:15:1	3:15:1	g	and IY re going
3:17:44	3:17:50	g	yes
3:19:17	3:19:20	f	so four or five inches and then there s a plane crash 
3:19:31	3:19:37	g	alright 
3:19:43	3:19:46	f	ok
3:20:7	3:20:12	g	after IY slope down IY d say
3:20:41	3:20:46	g	it s right next to it
3:20:47	3:20:55	g	maybe
3:22:9	3:22:18	f	so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
3:22:24	3:22:29	g	and IY re going up like
3:23:19	3:23:26	g	uh like
3:24:4	3:24:4	f	yep
3:27:8	3:27:11	g	and IY should have a straight line there
3:27:5	3:27:13	g	IY slope down again
3:29:1	3:29:1	g	no IY don t have a waterhole
3:32:3	3:32:3	g	ok and IY have to go up a little ways from the stony desert
3:32:18	3:32:25	g	like maybe an inch
3:32:36	3:32:38	g	and then IY re going down
3:35:38	3:35:40	g	ok well
3:39:10	3:39:16	g	so that s about IY would say
3:41:44	3:41:44	g	the slate mountain is towards the right
3:43:15	3:43:23	g	uhm
3:43:16	3:43:23	g	well
3:45:53	3:45:56	g	and then IY  IY go up
3:47:25	3:47:27	f	ok
3:48:31	3:48:36	g	a little past the antelope not much   just so IY go around it
3:48:48	3:48:52	g	straight up
3:49:8	3:49:8	f	ok
3:49:50	3:49:59	g	and then IY re curving to the left around slate mountain  do IY have a slate mountain 
3:50:44	3:50:47	g	and IY re sloping to the left
3:52:11	3:52:20	f	mm  mm
3:56:46	3:56:46	g	and then
3:56:45	3:56:50	g	ok
3:58:27	3:58:34	g	couple miles or something
3:58:44	3:58:46	g	three inches
4:0:2	4:0:4	g	uhm
4:0:46	4:0:53	f	around the top of the lake 
4:1:19	4:1:19	g	ok
4:2:1	4:2:2	g	ok
4:3:44	4:3:50	g	and then to the right and then IY go like two inches and that s the finish
4:4:4	4:4:4	g	and IY come  to a collapsed shelter 
4:3:59	4:4:6	g	couple inches IY re sloping down
4:5:32	4:5:34	f	to the right 
4:7:5	4:7:6	g	so
4:7:26	4:7:32	g	three inches straight across
4:7:49	4:7:55	f	mm hmm
4:7:50	4:7:55	g	ok
4:8:39	4:8:42	f	ok
4:10:9	4:10:17	g	that s IY little slope
4:12:7	4:12:7	g	from
4:12:41	4:12:49	g	ok
4:14:3	4:14:9	g	now IY re at the collapsed shelter
4:14:22	4:14:22	g	a quarter of an inch
4:15:13	4:15:20	g	and then IY slope
4:15:16	4:15:21	g	and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
4:15:21	4:15:23	g	four or five inches to the left
4:19:24	4:19:30	f	no IY ll go with hot springs IY have that
4:19:50	4:19:56	g	uhm
4:19:58	4:20:1	f	nope
4:22:8	4:22:11	f	around the lake to the top 
4:23:38	4:23:41	g	and then IY slope up
4:25:6	4:25:6	f	oh
4:27:21	4:27:27	f	ok
4:29:3	4:29:4	g	ok IY re at the savannah
4:29:4	4:29:9	g	after that IY go straight again
4:30:15	4:30:21	g	well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
4:30:17	4:30:24	f	but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
4:30:17	4:30:26	f	mm hmm
4:34:8	4:34:14	g	maybe IY have different things
4:34:26	4:34:32	g	IY don t know
4:34:41	4:34:46	f	ok
4:35:32	4:35:41	f	ok

4:37:27	4:37:31	g	uhm
4:38:18	4:38:21	f	and there s a collapsed shelter
4:43:39	4:43:42	g	three inches
4:45:0	4:45:5	g	ok 
4:46:19	4:46:22	g	about like
4:49:9	4:49:14	g	and IY re going straight up
4:50:4	4:50:6	g	IY plane crash 
4:50:27	4:50:28	g	oh IY know what the white   oh the white mountain    no IY re way up there IY shouldn t be over there
4:50:40	4:50:41	g	now IY re curving to the rigt and then IY go like a straight up about
4:50:41	4:50:47	g	just do it like this ok
4:51:57	4:52:5	g	the  
4:52:14	4:52:23	g	and then right around the antelope IY take a right
4:53:28	4:53:32	g	so IY make that circle
4:54:15	4:54:23	f	 IY m at the savannah
4:54:34	4:54:40	g	like four or five inches to the left
4:55:44	4:55:53	f	ok
4:55:48	4:55:55	f	IY hit some round rocks
4:56:52	4:56:54	g	IY just kind of slope down
4:58:15	4:58:20	g	so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
4:58:44	4:58:46	g	ok
4:59:3	4:59:3	f	and then what 
5:1:26	5:1:26	g	uhm IY straighten out IY slope 
5:2:5	5:2:6	f	yeah
5:3:31	5:3:39	g	uhm
5:8:39	5:8:40	g	well just
5:8:54	5:8:55	g	IY re sloping
5:9:38	5:9:42	g	for like
5:10:22	5:10:24	g	and there s a plane crash
5:13:18	5:13:27	f	yeah 
5:13:26	5:13:30	g	a little
5:13:23	5:13:30	g	and curve to  not down just curve to the left
5:13:32	5:13:41	f	mm hmm
5:14:27	5:14:32	f	uhm IY
5:15:32	5:15:37	g	uhm and there is a stony desert
5:15:45	5:15:51	g	uhm
5:18:36	5:18:36	f	ok
5:18:48	5:18:49	g	yeah the plane crash is kinda over there yeah
5:19:5	5:19:12	g	like
5:19:56	5:19:56	g	ok
5:20:16	5:20:25	f	IY m three inches above the savannah
5:21:13	5:21:17	g	kind of across from stony desert
5:24:53	5:24:57	g	like
5:29:20	5:29:21	f	ok wait hold on
5:30:7	5:30:16	f	and then IY have a white mountain like six inches to the left
5:30:36	5:30:45	g	ok
5:30:58	5:31:2	f	ok
5:32:22	5:32:29	g	and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
5:35:17	5:35:21	f	IY m starting  yeah the stony desert
5:35:33	5:35:38	f	IY plane crash is on the other side but IY ll just  ok 
5:35:35	5:35:39	f	do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
5:37:56	5:37:56	g	IY re starting at the stony desert
5:38:0	5:38:3	g	uhm
5:40:9	5:40:12	f	ok
5:41:2	5:41:3	g	and then IY are
5:41:9	5:41:12	g	it s like a slight little upwards to the right
5:41:17	5:41:19	f	how many inches do IY think 
5:43:58	5:44:0	g	alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
5:46:54	5:47:1	g	and IY go down IY slope to the right
5:47:22	5:47:27	g	IY move to the left
5:48:49	5:48:56	g	and IY slope is about an inch long
5:49:0	5:49:4	g	uhm
5:50:56	5:51:3	g	for like
5:51:4	5:51:7	f	nope IY have a white mountain
5:51:46	5:51:55	g	IY got that 
5:52:29	5:52:30	g	a little bit too
5:53:39	5:53:48	f	curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
5:55:12	5:55:15	g	but
5:56:32	5:56:32	f	yeah 
5:57:19	5:57:26	f	to

6:8:51	6:8:51	g	alright 
6:12:7	6:12:11	g	IY finish out IY slope and IY go about an inch straight
6:12:19	6:12:22	g	ok
6:14:9	6:14:14	g	an inch maybe a little bit less
