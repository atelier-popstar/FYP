0:8:53	0:8:56	g	30	536			well IY don t really slope IY just kind of like turn to the right  like it s a  just a turn
0:9:2	0:9:6	g	235	546			and then
0:12:26	0:12:35	g	45	755			and then

0:51:31	0:51:34	g	331	3094			and then so IY re curving to the left and IY go straight
0:53:15	0:53:19	g	196	3199			where IY re going down to a plane crash
0:53:53	0:53:54	f	274	3234			IY plane crash IY don t think is yeah  
0:53:54	0:54:0	f	71	3240			elephants

1:23:58	1:24:6	f	22	5046			ok
1:25:19	1:25:20	g	321	5120			as IY re sloping down IY ll come to hot wells do IY have hot wells 
1:25:57	1:25:57	f	309	5157			curve to the left and what is  how many inches away is the slate mountain 
1:25:58	1:26:4	f	163	5164			yep
1:27:46	1:27:48	g	245	5268			IY go to the left of the antelope    just a little bit

1:44:35	1:44:35	f	257	6275			yeah
1:45:35	1:45:36	f	19	6336			do IY go in between the plane crash and the antelope 
1:45:39	1:45:47	g	221	6347			and then IY slope
1:46:53	1:47:2	g	72	6422			and then
1:47:9	1:47:17	f	120	6437			around the lake to the top 
1:48:18	1:48:20	g	80	6500			IY wanna kind of curve
1:48:52	1:48:56	g	3	6536			well
1:49:36	1:49:40	g	25	6580			maybe
1:49:55	1:49:55	g	199	6595			maybe like
1:50:43	1:50:50	g	6	6650			IY have a waterhole on IY map 
1:51:57	1:52:5	f	219	6725			so IY go to the left of the antelope
1:52:37	1:52:46	f	53	6766			am IY supposed to start at the same place 
1:52:56	1:52:56	g	263	6776			and then IY are
1:53:10	1:53:18	g	67	6798			like an inch
1:54:19	1:54:25	g	17	6865			it s not a big curve
1:54:45	1:54:48	g	234	6888			after IY slope down IY d say
1:55:31	1:55:32	g	297	6932			are IY anywhere near there 
1:55:28	1:55:34	f	202	6934			mm  mm
1:57:12	1:57:12	f	29	7032			nope IY have a white mountain
1:57:59	1:58:6	g	107	7086			and IY re going straight up
1:58:33	1:58:40	g	237	7120			IY slope down again
1:59:12	1:59:14	f	83	7154			ok
2:0:34	2:0:34	g	167	7234			uhm
2:0:40	2:0:40	f	183	7240			nope
2:3:46	2:3:54	g	151	7434			the slate mountain is like diagonal from the white mountain
2:4:32	2:4:35	g	42	7475			an inch maybe a little bit less
2:4:49	2:4:58	g	168	7498			IY re going like
2:5:49	2:5:55	g	110	7555			so IY bring the circle in like a couple inches
2:8:38	2:8:38	f	149	7718			how many inches do IY think 
2:10:31	2:10:38	g	134	7838			uhm
2:11:24	2:11:31	g	144	7891			ok

2:12:0	2:12:8	g	93	7928			about like
2:15:13	2:15:17	g	249	8117			then
2:16:10	2:16:16	g	1	8176			alright  well just ignore the waterhole   are IY near a savannah at all 
2:17:0	2:17:3	g	240	8223			and there s a plane crash
2:18:20	2:18:24	g	52	8304			ok
2:18:24	2:18:28	f	23	8308			ok
2:20:20	2:20:29	f	128	8429			ok

2:23:47	2:23:56	g	268	8636			ok
2:23:59	2:24:8	g	312	8648			and IY slope is about an inch long
2:25:21	2:25:30	g	275	8730			to the white mountain
2:28:46	2:28:52	f	142	8932			so wait
2:29:22	2:29:30	f	121	8970			but that s like five six inches from where IY am now
2:30:13	2:30:22	g	141	9022			what 
2:33:4	2:33:11	g	306	9191			just do it like this ok
2:33:52	2:33:58	g	49	9238			four or five inches to the left
2:34:12	2:34:12	g	132	9252			uhm
2:34:48	2:34:52	g	185	9292			it s right next to it
2:35:23	2:35:31	g	264	9331			IY move to the left
2:40:16	2:40:17	g	192	9617			alright 
2:43:13	2:43:20	f	273	9800			up diagonally to the right of the antelope
2:43:28	2:43:36	g	87	9816			and then after IY inch IY gradually  well actually no it s not really gradual    it s kinda like a steep slope up
2:44:8	2:44:16	g	231	9856			like maybe like an inch up from the stony desert is where IY start
2:46:17	2:46:20	g	103	9980			IY re going about
2:47:46	2:47:46	g	171	10066			a quarter of an inch
2:48:28	2:48:35	g	172	10115			ok
2:50:7	2:50:10	f	280	10210			ok
2:50:52	2:50:55	g	301	10255			so IY re starting and there s a stony desert right across from where IY start

2:58:41	2:58:43	g	135	10723			so
3:3:38	3:3:39	g	335	11019			so anyway
3:4:16	3:4:19	g	319	11059			and IY slope is about two inches it s like a two inch slope 
3:6:1	3:6:3	g	44	11163			ok
3:6:15	3:6:21	g	285	11181			and IY re sloping to the left
3:9:48	3:9:48	g	338	11388			and IY go down IY slope to the right

3:23:55	3:23:58	f	28	12238			and then what 
3:24:13	3:24:21	g	229	12261			and IY re sloping down and then IY stop and IY go straight
3:24:25	3:24:28	g	113	12268			where are IY right now   start at the savannah
3:24:26	3:24:30	g	230	12270			it s like right there like where IY little path is it s right to the left of it
3:26:35	3:26:38	g	270	12398			go up like three  three and a half inches
3:27:40	3:27:49	g	89	12469			IY re actually starting like right
3:29:38	3:29:38	g	20	12578			like

3:41:32	3:41:32	f	91	13292			am IY supposed to hit every spot on the map 
3:41:47	3:41:54	f	173	13314			and to the right 
3:42:4	3:42:13	g	77	13333			no

3:54:0	3:54:0	g	37	14040			ok
3:56:32	3:56:34	g	187	14194			and IY do the curve again and IY just go straight down
3:57:14	3:57:23	f	70	14243			IY ve a plane crash though
3:58:18	3:58:18	f	239	14298			ok

4:5:35	4:5:37	g	254	14737			uhm
4:5:55	4:5:56	g	324	14756			and then IY ll come to a savannah
4:6:3	4:6:6	g	206	14766			IY re kind of going a little bit to the left and then IY kind of slope down
4:6:13	4:6:19	g	177	14779			and that s where the plane crash is
4:8:55	4:9:4	f	50	14944			mm hmm
4:9:14	4:9:22	g	61	14962			ok
4:9:58	4:10:4	g	62	15004			after that IY go straight again
4:10:16	4:10:22	f	251	15022			so IY pass a waterhole or no 
4:10:34	4:10:42	g	85	15042			and then
4:11:28	4:11:36	g	281	15096			kind of across from stony desert

5:41:25	5:41:27	g	174	20487			but
5:48:7	5:48:8	g	184	20888			after the circle

6:13:13	6:13:13	g	179	22393			uhm
6:13:57	6:14:6	g	150	22446			so it s a    kinda like a grad   not a gradual it s a steep slope
6:14:36	6:14:42	f	333	22482			to the left of the antelope
6:15:29	6:15:38	g	334	22538			IY don t know

6:27:25	6:27:29	g	13	23249			ok IY re at the savannah
6:27:27	6:27:34	g	317	23254			IY re at the plane crash

6:40:27	6:40:36	f	318	24036			ok
6:41:20	6:41:26	f	336	24086			so from the start go down to the left and then curve up around to the right 
6:41:39	6:41:42	f	123	24102			mm hmm
6:41:58	6:41:58	g	156	24118			after plane crash
6:42:36	6:42:36	g	289	24156			around the bottom of it
6:42:36	6:42:43	f	54	24163			ok

6:42:57	6:42:58	g	40	24178			so IY go three inches straight
6:44:1	6:44:1	g	94	24241			are IY in like almost the top of the
6:44:54	6:44:55	g	259	24295			IY got that 
6:45:17	6:45:19	g	98	24319			ok well
