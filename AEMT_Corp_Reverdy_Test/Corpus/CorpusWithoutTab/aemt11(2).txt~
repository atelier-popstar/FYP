g ok
g uhm
g where is your starting point 
g I'm assuming that they're all in the same places now
f yeah it's above a diamond mine
g oh ok
f ok should I just read you everything I have 
g huh 
f should I just read you everything on my map 
g uh sure go ahead
f ok I have a diamond mine
g why don't you read them in uhm
f in order 
g yeah in like
g left to right going down
f yeah ok
f uhm
f well in like the upper right corner I have  a fast running creek
g wait left to right
f uhm upper right
g no can you read in left to right direction 
f ok so to the right of the diamond mine is a fast running creek
g oh
g oh ok
g fast running creek
f yeah it's a little b  it's like more  a little bit more in the corner
f ok and then I have a desert
f on the left
g wait on the left 
f do you  do you have a desert 
g oh yeah I do
f ok
f do you have canoes 
g no
f ok it's like an inch below fast running creek
g fast running creek  wait where was your fast running creek again 
f it's  
g oh yeah
g uhm ok I have that well I have a carved wooden pole
f oh I don't have a carv  oh I have a carved  that's at the bottom I have  
g oh I have two
f do you have one at the  
f ok where's your top one 
g my top one
g is uhm parallel to the desert
g but it's to the right of it
f ok
g by about  
g by about four inches
g four and a half inches
f ok
f ok
g mmm
g yeah roughly
f ok so is it  do you have an apache camp 
g yeah
f so is it  
f like
f you know
f an inch and a half diagonally away from the apache camp 
g yeah it's like kind of in between the desert and the apache camp
f is it centred 
g uhm
g centre but maybe half an inch to the right
f ok and it's  and it's on the same line as the desert
g a little bit below
f a little bit below
g yeah like maybe half an inch below
f ok
g do you have an apache camp on the very righthand side 
f yeah
g ok do you have a walled city 
f yeah
g where is that located 
f uhm
f directly underneath the diamond mine
f but
f inches down
g ok yeah got it
f ok
g do you have flat rocks 
f yeah
g to the righthand side near the centre of the paper
f mine is below the apache camp
g mm hmm
f uh
f on the  a little bit to the left of the apache camp though
g mm hmm ok I have that
f ok
g do you have stone creek 
f uhm yeah
f do you have ghost town 
g no
f ok do you have a saloon bar 
g no
f ok do you see the second carved wooden pole 
g yeah
f if you go up from the top of that if you go up like two inches
g mm hmm
f and it's just you know half an inch to the left
g mm hmm
f that's ghost town
f and they have a picture of a saloon
g ok
f uhm if you go to the right of the ghost town
g mm hmm
f like
f you know almost just stright to the right
g mm hmm
f uh
f like an inch below the flat rocks
g do you have  a stone creek 
g I have the stone creek
f oh
f do you have stone creek kind of like
f uhm
f in the middle ish of the page
g yeah
f ok keep  on going to the right
g mm hmm
f uhm
f well it's on the same line as ghost town
g mm hmm
f but it
f like stone creek is in between ghost town and the saloon bar
g ok
f yeah
f so uhm
g do you have buffalo 
f yeah
g on the righthand side lower corner
f mm hmm
g and then do you have cattle ranch 
f no I don't have cattle ranch 
g ok my cattle ranch is  
g you see the carved wooden pole right 
f yeah
g it's kind of  it's uhm  
g it's in between the carved wooden pole and the buffalo
f ok
g maybe about an inch and a half below though
f ok
g below  that parallel
f ok
g and then do you see a fort 
f yeah
g to the left of the cattle ranch or to what I have as a cattle ranch
f ok
g and then
f is it  is it almost straight to the left 
g yeah
f ok
g ok this should be easier
f ok
g Julie's got brains
g ok from the start
g you're gonna go south
f ok
g six o'clock
f six o'clock
g and you're gonna curve around the diamond mine
f ok
g and go right beneath it
f ok
g and then you're gonna curve
g uhm
g to the l  
g uhm around up and to the l  
g on the right hand side of the fast running creek
f ok so
f the fast running creek is below my line
g no it's above your line
f wait am I going  
f so the f  
f the fast running creek is uhm
f I don't go  
f my line isn't  
f so it's  
g draw your line
g bel  
g so that it goes below 
g it's underneath the fast running creek
f does it go around the canoes 
g oh man I forgot where you said you canoes were
g just make sure it follow uhm
g maybe about
g uhm eleven o'clock
f mm hmm
g uhm
g it should just follow the periph  
g the 
g circumference of the graveyard relatively
f the graveyard 
g I mean sorry the fast running creek
f ok uhm
g and then uhm
g just follow along the
g so that your path should be on the righthand side of the fast running creek
f my path is  
f so I draw a straight line from the diamond mine to the fast running creek 
g yeah
f ok
g and uhm
g curve a little bit so you're making like a  
g like a half moon
f mm hmm
g uhm
g along the right hand side of the fast running creek
g and then you're gonna make
f wait what do you mean by the right hand side of the fast running creek 
g like you see the landmark of the fast running creek
f yeah
g you wanna be on the righthand side of it
g so you're not going through it
f uh huh
g but 
g you're following the circumference on the right hand side
f ok
g and uhm
g uhm
g at the
g I guess like the apex of the crescent moon
g that kind of curve right
f mm hmm
g uhm you wanna make
g two o'clock
g you wanna go two o'clock direction upper right hand
g I mean
g north to the right
g does it make sense 
f no
f are you are you  is the path going around anything there 
g ok
g yeah it's going around your fast flowing river
f wait how is it going around the river if my line is below the river 
g oh
g uhm
g I have a fast flowing river
g and you have
f I have a fast running creek
g yeah your fast
g my flat  
g fast flowing river is to the  
g would be to the right of your fast   
g I guess you don't have that landmark anywhere
f mm mm
g but uhm
g it's like relative to the upper right hand corner
f mm hmm
g it's maybe an inch and a half down
f ok
g and two inches to the left edge
g so just like kind of make an X there
f ok
g and then just draw your uhm path like
g up
g and around it
f ok so the fast running creek is to the left of the fast running river 
g yeah
f oh is it directly to the left 
g so basically
g just basically wherever
g uhm on my paper the fast flowing river is a very upper right hand landmark
g so just draw an X in that general direction I mean  
g general area and just draw your path
f ok so is the picture of the river like  
f is that above the picture of the creek 
g mmm
g I don't know because I don't have that picture of the creek
f oh you don't have the creek
g yeah I have a graveyard instead
f where do you have your graveyard 
g well I guess I'm assuming where your fast running creek would be
f uhm
g you said it's to the right of the diamond mines right 
f it's not directly to the right though
f it's uhm
f maybe four inches over and an inch up from the diamond mine
g oh that's where my fast flowing river is then
f oh ok
g uhm
f uhm where is your  where is your graveyard 
g it's like
g  kind of like basically in a dead middle between the diamond mine and the fast flowing river
f ok
g so just draw an X there
f ok and this is the graveyard 
g and then uhm
f so I'm go  the graveyard is above my line 
g yeah
f ok
f ok
f and so I have the fast running creek
f so I  
f my picture of the creek is kind of like
f uhm
f a very funny looking S
g mm hmm does the picture really matter 
f well if I'm going around the picture then
g ok yeah
g I mean
g just
f ok what's  
g  give yourself ample space as you go around the landmark
f ok so the creek is above the line
g no I'm sorry the line should be above the creek
f ok
g like
g oh
g hmm
f ok so I'm starting here I'm going around the diamond mine so the diamond mine is to the right of my line and then above it
g mm hmm
g mm hmm
f and then I go from the diamond mine   is it like a straight line to the creek 
g uhm it curves a little bit up maybe about a  
g at
g two no three o'clock
g no sorry
g two o'clock
f ok
f and it goes  so the creek is below the line and to the left
g uhm
g you mean w  
g no
g uhm
g did you make  did you mark  
g did you mark an X where my graveyard would be on your paper 
f yeah
g ok
g  so on that graveyard you wanna just follow up
g make a kind of
g make a kind of crescent moon shape  uh moon curve
g uhm
f at the graveyard
g yeah
g like
g on it's  
g so that the graveyard is on the lefthand side
f ok
g and then from there you wanna curve up
g and 
g over the fast flow  fast running creek
f ok so I'm going around the graveyard and so I have like a half circle
g mm hmm
f uhm at the graveyard and then I just go up from there
g yeah and then just from there kind of uhm
g go straight to the fast running creek
g and make sure your path is on top of the landmark
g and it curves so that the landmark is on the inside
g basically it's on the  
f mm hmm
g it's below and to the left of your path
f ok
g ok
f ok
g then you're gonna go straight down six o'clock for maybe about
g uhm
g two inches
f ok
g and you're gonna make a forty five degree
g uhm south
g south and to the left
g right above the apache camp
f ok
g and then your path is gonna  then swing your path right below the carved wooden pole
f ok
g and then it should go uhm
g the path should be above and to the left of the walled city
f above and to the left
g mm hmm
f how is the path above and to the left 
g is your walled city below the carved wooden pole relatively like  
f yeah
g to the parallel lines
f mm hmm
g is it to the left of the carved wooden pole 
f yeah
g so uhm just follow your path and 
g start right beneath the carved wooden pole
f ok
g right
f mm hmm
g just keep following it as in a relatively parallel line
f mm hmm
g and you should be able to  
g  your path should go above the walled city
f ok
g kind of emcompassing the walled city
f oh I see so the path is  
g and curving around
f ok I see
g so that  
g yeah so you're kind of encasing the landmark
f ok
g and then go all the way down and where you see your ghost town
f mm hmm
g you're gonna curve right beneath it and make a right turn
f ok so is the line straight down from the walled city to ghost town 
g no it slants a little bit
g uhm
g to the  
g it slants maybe at seven o'clock
f ok
g and then go sweep right beneath the ghost town
f ok
f ok
g and then uhm
g your path should then slant upwards
g to the right maybe about forty five degrees
f mm hmm
g so that your path is going  is above the stone creek
f uh huh
g uhm below the flat rocks as you keep going right and right above the saloon bar
f ok
f ok
g so it's in between the flat rocks and saloon bar
f ok
g and then so then you should be like really close to the right edge of the paper right 
f mm hmm
f yeah
g so just swing all the way down maybe about four inches
f mm hmm
g and uhm swing around the buffalo so that you're encasing the buffalo
f ok
g that is your path is in between the landmark, buffalo and the right edge of the paper
f wait my path is  
g it's in that ti  it's like squeezed in that tiny space betwee the buffalo and the edge
f ok so   ok so from the saloon bar  
g mm hmm
f  so the saloon bar is uhm below my line
g yeah
f ok and then I just draw a line straight down and have the buffalo on the left of the line 
g yeah
f ok
g and so the path should go right below the buffalo pa  
g landmark right 
g it's below it 
f ok so   ok and then I go left 
g yeah
f so the buffalo is above the line 
g mm hmm
f ok
g and then uhmm curve your line a little bit above so that it goes over the cattle ranch
f ok
g and you're still moving in the left direction
f ok
g and then swing your uhm
g as soon as you pass the cattle ranch bring your line down so that it's gonna go underneath the fort
f ok
g and then finish
g uhm
g ok
g bring your pencil to the lower lefthand corner of the fort
f ok
g and your angle is gonna be roughly about forty five degrees
g for maybe an inch
g forty five degrees up
g to the left
f ehm
f forty five degrees up to the left 
g yeah
f how far do I keep going 
g about an inch
f about an inch
g uh huh
f ok and this  so it's  
g and then  and then bring your line kind of straight up like curve it gently up for another inch
f ok
g and that's the finish
f ok I'm confused
f still going around the graveyard and the fast running creek at the very top 
g ok
g uhm
g you said you had the diamond where is your  ok  
g like
g where my landmark is for the fast flowing river
g I said   mentioned before that it w  I think I'm pretty sure it's where your fast running creek is
f is it is it  
g like it's on the  it's a very upper righthand landmark
f uh huh
g on this whole sheet of paper
f ok and it's like an inch down from the top
g mm hmm
f and like two inches from the left 
g yeah
f ok
f and so how do I get from the graveyard to the fast running creek 
g ok well
g did you  
g ok so you marked where my graveyard would be
f yeah
g right
f can you  what's the shape of the graveyard 
g ok so
g what's the shape 
f yeah
f what's the shape of the picture 
g it's just
g graveyards and crosses  it's about maybe two inches horizontally in diameter
f uh huh
g and maybe an inch vertically
f ok
f ok
g so ok so from the starting line you're going south
g you curve
g uhm
g to the right below the diamond mine
f mm hmm
g and then uhm bring the line
g mmm
g ok and so your line is still going to the right
g you wanna curve it up annd make like a  
g like a  
g crescent shaped curve
g uhm
g following the perimeter of the graveyard  where the landmark would be
g like on the righthand side
g so you're going all the way underneath the graveyard
f mm hmm
g and then you're curving up following its right side
f ok
g and then you swing your line
g and your line is still going to the right
f mm hmm
g and just bring it up and over where your fast running creek landmark is
f ok
f ok
g then bring it all the way down to the apache camp
f ok
g ok I think we're done
f ok
