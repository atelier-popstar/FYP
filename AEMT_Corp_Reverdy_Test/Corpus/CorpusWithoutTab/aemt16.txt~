g oh hmm
f hmm
g ok
g do you have a start right next to the stony desert 
f yeah I have a st  
f it's a little bit above but yeah
g ok yep
g ok
g do you wanna  
g uhm
g ok
g hmm
g ok
g do you
g wanna tell me what you have on your map and then I'll just write it down and then I'll tell you how to get there 
f oh alright ok
g we tried this before
f alright well what I have that's right around the stony desert is
f uhm
f going from
f left to right I guess
f is uhm
f  ok I have a collapsed shelter
f which is up and to the left
g above that right 
g yep ok I have that
f ok
f and then
f just to the right of the collapsed shelter I have the waterhole
f do you have that 
g to the right of it you have a waterhole 
f yeah
g ok I don't have that
f ok there's a waterhole
g ok
g do you have uhm a savannah to the right of it 
f and then a savannah even to the right of the waterhole
g ok
f ok
g ok
f so where should I
g ok
f head towards
g alright we'll start with that
g so actually I have to the left
f ok
g like
g right diagonal going down to the left
g uhm
g and then horizontal on the same line as the stony desert is a site of a plane crash
g so if you wanna just put an X there
f oh alright
f so I make si  
g yeah
f so the site  
f is the site of the plane crash beneath this collapsed shelter 
g yep like kind of diagonal a tiny bit
g and 
g to the  going towards the left
f but is it  
f oh diagonal and to the left of the collapsed shelter
g yep
g but it's on like the same line as the stony desert
f oh alright
f oh alright ok
f I just have it a little
g like horizontal
f ok
g so
g ok we can start with this
f alright
g so
g you're starting above the stony desert so you wanna kind of go around the stony desert towards the left
g and down
g kind of going horizontal as you go down
g and you wanna end it at the  like at the   where the stony desert ends kind of
f ok
g  and then go straight all the way to the left
f ok
g and go right around the plane crash
f so uhm
g and then
f ok so I'm gonna kind of make a right at the plane
g yep
f plane crash 
g or yeah like you're kind of going right up
f ok
g you know
f ok
f so I'm ki  I'm circling around the plane crash
g yeah you're circling around and up like you're making almost like a rectangle
f ok
g and then
g like you're gonna stop
g like
g uhm
g like at the top of the collapsed shelter
g like on that line and you're gonna go straight
g like you're gonna kind of make a right at that
g and go straight past the collapsed shelter like the collapsed shelter will be below the line
f oh ok
g and then circle it
f I don't think I got it
g ki  
f so I'm gonna circle around the collapsed shelter 
g yep like you're gonna uhm
g kind of like end your line right at like the end of the collapsed shelter
g and then
g you're gonna make kind of a horizontal line going towards the right and you're gonna end at the R
f ok
g and then
g you're gonna continue right
g and 
g your thing that you said I forget what it was 
f but the thi  where should I go between though 
f should I go between  
f I have the waterhole
g yeah go the waterhole will be above your route
f oh alright
g and then you're gonna
f ok
g stop at the savannah
g and the savannah will be on your right
f ok
f ok
f so I'm sort of between the waterhole and the savannah now
g yep
f ok
g so
g yeah well actually you wanna be right next to the savannah
g but on the lefthand side of it
f ok
f alright
g and then you're gonna go  do you have a slate mountain 
g probably not
f no
g ok
f no
g well
g you're gonna go straight up about one  
g like
g three and a half inches
f ok
g and then you're gonna stop
f oh alright
g and then
g you're gonna
g what do you have around that area  anything 
f around this area 
g yeah where you are
f there's nothing that close really
f I mean I have  
g ok
g alright well then I'll just do it th  
g ok
g so you're gonna kind of round like go straight to the left
g and that's about an inch and a half
f ok
f so
f well am I gonna go to the left
g like you're gonna
f just
f just in a horizontal line or
g nope straight across
f or
g like just straight and then you're gonna go like kind of round like go horizontal down to the left
g for a bit
f ok
g and you like you're  
f what should I be headed towards 
g well
g you're gonna be like
g about a few inches above the collapsed shelter
f oh ok
g you should be right above that
f alright
g and then you're gonna go straight
f yeah
g to the left for about a half an inch
g and then you should end it actually at the C of the collapsed shelter
g your straight line
f ok
g and then go
g uhm
g horizontal but a tiny tiny bit vertical to the left
g I mean horizontal but vertical
g I meant diagonal
f di  ok
g to the left
g but like
g very
g uhm
g like almost horizontal
f well but the thing is I have  
f do you have elephants 
g I mean straight
f I have elephants ok
g no I don't have
g where are your elephants 
f there's  
f uhm
f well do you have the hot springs 
g I have hot wells
f uhm
g and that's like above my collapsed shelter
f they're above the collapsed shelter
g yeah
f that's probably the same
g ok
f so I'll say hot wells
g so you're right underneath the  
f probably actually the same thing
g you're right underneath the hot wells then or whatever
f but
f yeah I'm under the hot wells but
f uhm
f over to
f to the left but like diagonally left and below the hot wells hot springs there's the elephants
g yeah
g ok
f ok
g so you  what you wanna do is you kind of want to go right around the elephants
f ok
g y  the elephants will be on the right of your route you're gonna be like more towards the edge of the paper
f oh alright
g and 
g instead of going all the way around when you loop around you're gonna go
g like
g straight up
f ok
g and then well kind of like a little tiny bit diagonal to the right
g just kind of curve it in
f ok
g and then you're gonna 
g that's for a while you're gonna be like   I don't know what  what do you have up there 
g like as you're going up
f ok well
f I have a white mountain
g yep you're gonna go right towards the white mountain
f ok
g and then
g you're gonna stop the curve right at the peak of the mountain
g and then you're gonna go completely straight up
f oh at the
g like at the top of the mountain
f wait but do I
f am I gonna cross  
f am I gonna go to the left of the mountain or the right 
g yep you're gonna stay right to the left of the mountain
f I'm gonna stay
f ok
g and then you're gonna go straight up
g for about t  
g uh two inches
f ok
f so 
f two inches above the peak of this mountain 
g yep you're still on the like the left of it though
f ok
g straight up and then you're gonna make a right
f ok
g do you have anything   yeah do you have anything over there 
f no wait there's  
f yeah I have round rocks
g ok
f do you have round rocks 
g so 
g I have a lake but it's probably in the  it's in the same spot kind of towards the right
f well
f yeah so you have the lake over towards the right but then
g yeah
f see my round rocks are to the left of the lake a little bit below
g ok
f like diagonally to the left
g I have roman baths over there
f you have what 
g oh well kind of  roman baths
g  so what you wanna do is round the rocks
g like go right around them
f so should I go  
f should I keep them on my right or my left 
g keep them like in the in  like  
g keep them on the uh  keep the route on the outside of the rocks
f ok
g and then go right around it
g  and then kind of go straight to the left after you round it
f whoops I've lost them 
g and then
g when you hit the end of the rocks
g I'm assuming
f so I'm headed  
f I'm headed right
g like it's kinda like a little
g like a little thing sticking out after you draw it like it's a little circle thing sticking out
g kind of
g or something I don't know
f oh wait
g like
g you're looping like it's almost like a loop around the lake
f oh wait I didn't get to the  wait wait wait
g oh I'm sorry
f we have to back all the way up
g you're  it's your rocks your rocks
f ok wait a minute
f yeah I'm like
f I'm mixed up with my
f wait a minute but where is your  
f so you had this other thing up there
f it's not the lake
g roman baths
f it's not the round rocks   where were those 
g that's right below my lake 
f oh alright ok
g so you went around your lake
g and then go to the left make like a straight line
f but wait wait wait I never  
f can we back all the way up to the  
g oh yeah go ahead I'm sorry
f to the mountain
g oh yeah I'm sorry go ahead what
f ok
f alright so
f so I was going  
f alright so I was headed up past the tip of the mountain right 
g yep like
g two inches
f ok
f and then what was I  was I going below my rocks 
f  or above 
g go to the right straight to the right and once you hit your rocks
f ok
g you're gonna curve above the rocks
g to like the perimeter of them
f ok
g and then
f ok
g you're gonna kind of go to the left
f I think that was just  this is what I just I had before ok
g so go to the left
g and then go straight down
g for about 
g uhm
g three inches
f oh wait this still isn't  
f I'm sorry ok
f this still isn't making
f this still isn't makind sense
f so
f wait so you have  
f you have the lake
g mm hmm
f so the lake is like the  
f so I think  we have that in the same place but then below your lake you have a roman  
g bath yes
f roman baths
g so you're gonna be like making  
g what do you have 
g you have something
f so  then you have the   so I didn't have the roman baths
g but you had something else
f but the  I had round rocks
f that are
f to the left
f of the lake
g ok
f I have these round rocks
g well the  
g ok
f to the left of the lake
f not quite as high as the lake but to the left of it
g ok well you could just uhm that'll be right you'll just keep that
f ok
f but should I go  
f so
f but
g that'll be like on the inside
f with these  
f that'll be on the   ok so that was gonna be on the inside 
g your route
g yeah
g so just keep everything on the  your route on the outside
f ok and go around the lake as well 
g ok
g yep go around the outside of the lake
f ok
f ok
g and then you're gonna go straight down
f ok
g well you're gonna go towards the left for a little like an inch
g or yeah an inch
f ok
g and then go straight down for about three inches
f but uhm but what should I go between
g well keep everything on the outside
g the  like everything on the right so your route will be on the left
f ok
f but
f wait a minute
f but do you have  do you have another site of a plane crash 
g yeah all the way to the right
f so you have another site of the  
f but what should I go
f in between
f so I was headed up around the lake and made this sort of clockwise circle around the lake
g yep
f was that right 
g yep
g and then you go
g a little like kind of straighten out the circle
f but what should I go  
g or straighten out your line
g and then you're just going straight down
f ok
f but what should I go between  I mean should I go  
g well you're gonna be like kind of parallel to the white mountain
f to the  
g as you go down
f alright
g and you're gonna kind of end  
f but do I stay to the right of the  of this other plane crash and to the right of everything 
g no you stay to the left
f oh to the left
g yeah
f ok
g and then you're gonna be parallel to th  
f I don't know if I have my roman baths in the right place but
f is your roman baths just below the lake 
g yep
f ok
f but I have to keep
f so what I did was I went between the lake and the roman bath
f is that ok 
g yep that's what you're suppose to do
f oh alright okay
g and then you're gonna be parallel to the white mountain
g and you're gonna end your straight line where the mountain ends
f so I'm going it's straight down
g yeah
f ok
f alright so I'm kind of at the base of the mountain now
g yeah
f alright
g and then you're gonna  make a right
f ok
g go about an inch and a half and stop
f but do you have antelope 
g yep
f ok
g the antelope will be on the outside
f  of this curve 
g yeah
f so I'm  so I go down between the white mountain and the antelope
g yeah
f right
g mm hmm
f and then
f ok so I'm right there I'm at the base of the mountain
g and then you're just gonna make a right
f I'm gonna go to the right
g yep
f ok
g and then just for an inch and a half and stop
f ok
g and that's it
f oh alright
f so it ends near the antelope
g yep
f ok
f I don't know why this was harder than the last one or something
