g ok uhm
g you have a canadian paradise 
f mm hmm right below the start
g yeah do you have an old mill 
f uhm
f down to the right
g yeah
g uhm do you have an abandoned cottage 
f  uhm I have a picket fence down to the left of the mill mill wheel
g ok is it uhm is it like an inch below the mill 
f yeah an inch to the left
f like a forty five degree angle to the left of the mill wheel
g oh ok
g ok this is a picket fence
g ok uhm
g do you see like if you go  
g uhm how many fenced meadows do you have 
f fenced meadows
g mm hmm
f just one
g ok
g well I guess if you go
g uhm
g do you see the mill 
f mm hmm
g if you go over like four inches and up an inch
f mm hmm
g do you have anything there 
f wait go up four inches
g no go across four inches and up one inch
g or two inches
f uhm a forest
g a forest 
f mm hmm
g ok
g uhm
g do you have an abandoned cottage 
f yeah
g ok uhm
g and you have
g your one fenced meadow is like two inches above the canadian paradise
f no
f it's uhm
g oh is it at the bottom of the page
f yeah it's basically parallel to where my picket fence or I guess like
f uhm
f  a little bit on the
f below the mill wheel but on the same plane it's to the right
f so it's like the most right bottom corner
g yeah
g ok
g uhm
g if you see like the top of the tree of canadian paradise
f mm hmm
g if you go up like two and a half inches
f I have nothing
g uhm ok well
g uhm
g ok
g yeah so if you go up two and a half inches
g and it's maybe three inches from the abandoned cottage that's where another fenced meadow is
f three inches to the left of the abandoned cottage
g uhm
g or maybe more like two and a half
f is it parallel to the abandoned co  
f I mean is it on the same plane as the   
g uhm no it's actually it's like uhm
g one down
g like it's an inch below the abandoned cottage
f hmm
g and it's like two inches above
g the canadian paradise
f ok
g ok
g uhm you have west lake
f yeah
g ok uhm
g do you  
g to the right of west lake do you have a peak marker 
f no I have a farmed land
g oh ok
g well uhm
g if you  
g if you look at the farmed land
f mm hmm
g you know how it kinda it looks like a widow's peak
f yeah
g ok well if you go to the point of the widow's peak
f uh huh
g and if you go down like two inches
f mm hmm
g uhm annd draw like a box kind of thing
f mm hmm
g with a little triangle at top so it's you know a makeshift house
f mm hmm
g uhm that's a peak marker
f and should this peak marker be maybe about an inch to the left  I mean to the right of west lake 
g yeah
f ok
g yeah
g uhm and
g do you have a monument 
f yes
g do you have a nuclear test site 
f no
g ok uhm
g do you see kind of how east lake looks like a dog 
f yeah
g uhm
g and
g I guess where the little tail is
f uh huh
g uhm ok so you follow that line to the bottom
g where I guess the hind feet are
f mm hmm
g and it   just one inch down from the hind feet is nuclear test site
f uh huh
g ok and then uhm where the  
f mm hmm
g the front feet would be
g maybe three quarters of an inch to the left
f mm hmm
g uhm that's the X finish mark
f three quarters to the left
f ok
g ok
g so I guess
f do you have a golf course 
g no where's your golf course
f  uhm my golf course is uhm right below the east lake
f if you were to take where the   imagine where the tummy is of the dog
g mm hmm
f it's like maybe an inch below that
g oh ok
f kind of in between the f  
f uhm the fore and rear limbs
g oh ok I think I  
g uhm
g is it maybe like
g an inch and a half from the nuclear test site I told you
f uhm
f to th  
g yeah and a little bit above
f yeah
g ok and that's a golf course
f mm hmm
g ok
g  ok so I guess you start at the start
f mm hmm
g uhm you go to  you stay to the left of canadian paradise
f mm hmm
g uhm so it's kind of a   
g well yeah so uhm you go a little bit to the left and down
f mm hmm
g and go keep on going down
f mm hmm
g uhm I guess go around the picket fence
f mm hmm
g so the picket fence is above the line
f mm hmm
g and then go straight back up
f mm hmm
g uhm
g and around the old mill
f mm hmm
g  not completely around but around that curve
f mm hmm
g uhm so the old mill is below and to the right of the line
f yeah yeah
g and then you  
g you know where your forest is 
f mm hmm
g so you're drawing a straight line from the old mill to the forest
f mm hmm
g and you go around the forest so the forest is above the line andd to the left
f mm hmm
g and uhm
g do you have an abandoned cottage
f mm hmm
g ok so  and then you just go from the forest and follow that around
g uhm the abandoned cottage
g it's kind of just a very slightly curved line
f mm hmm
g uhm so the abandoned cottage is below and to the left of the line
f mm hmm
g uhm
g and then remember the fenced meadow
f mm hmm
g from like the chimney of the abandoned cottage
f mm hmm
g you're basically drawing a straight line or almost a straight line
f mm hmm
g to the fenced meadow and it kind of curves up a little bit after that
f mm hmm
f mm hmm
g and so it's like you know the infinity sign how it looks like an eight on it's side
f mm hmm
g  so if you only take like the top half of the right side and the bottom half of the left
f mm hmm
g that's kind of what it looks like
f ok
g and then from there it goes straight up
g it you know kind of curves straight up
f uh huh
g and then do you see west lake 
f mm hmm
g how uhm
g there's
g it looks like there's two little pointy things at top
f mm hmm
g uhm well that one kind of
g where the two pointy things  
g uhm
g where there's that kind of thing
g uhm
g sh  ok
g you know how there's like a V in between them
f yeah where that delta is
g yeah ok
f or no the peninsula 
g yeah whatever that is
f whatever the body of water
g uhm yeah if you go straight down  
f that's not a peninsula anyways go on
g yeah if you go straight down from that little  from that point
f uh huh
g  uhm that's kind of you know how the bottom of west lake makes like a slight curve and it goes and has another slight curve
f mm hmm
g well if you  ok so the path follows around that right side
g the right curve
f mm hmm
g and uhm
g it keeps on going around the lake until
g uhm
g that's the right pointy thing until that starts to point kind  well no
f ok
g uhm where the V is 
f uh huh
g uhm
g if you go to the right
f mm hmm
g that's about as high as the path goes
f ok
g and so you're going around the peak marker again
f uh huh
g uhm
g you're kind of 
g you're   it's  you're just curving  so the peak marker is below it and you're curving around it
f mm hmm
g and you have the monument
f mm hmm
g uhm so from the
g the peak marker you're just drawing a straight line to the moument it's like forty five degrees
f mm hmm
g you go around the monument
f below 
g uhm below the monument yeah
f mm hmm
g and then uhm
g I guess
g kind of curve it around
g so 
g uhm
g it's kind of like a part half of an eight again
f mm hmm
g uhm
g so yeah so it's like uh
g right side of the bottom at the left side of the top
f do I  
f do I curve around the nuclear site and then around the west lake to the finish line 
g uhm
g it's to the  the line is to the left of the nuclear test site
f yeah
g and I think it kind of goes around your golf course
f mm hmm
g so the golf course is below and to the left of the line
f mm hmm
g yeah and then you just go it's like a straight line to the finish
f ok
g it's not completely straight but
f yeah
f ok
g ok
